<br />
VAN BUREN AND ABOLITION<br />
<br />
1833-1837</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">After</span> Van Buren's inauguration as Vice President, he made Washington
his permanent residence, and again became the President's chief
adviser. His eye was now intently fixed upon the White House, and the
long, rapid strides, encouraged by Jackson, carried him swiftly toward
the goal of his ambition. He was surrounded by powerful friends.
Edward Livingston, the able and accomplished brother of the
Chancellor, still held the office of secretary of state; Benjamin F.
Butler, his personal friend and former law partner, was
attorney-general; Silas Wright, the successor of Marcy, and Nathaniel
P. Tallmadge, the eloquent successor of the amiable Dudley, were in
the United States Senate. Among the members of the House, Samuel
Beardsley and Churchill C. Cambreling, firm and irrepressible, led the
Administration's forces with conspicuous ability. At Albany, Marcy was
governor, Charles L. Livingston was speaker of the Assembly, Azariah
C. Flagg state comptroller, John A. Dix secretary of state, Abraham
Keyser state treasurer, Edwin Croswell state printer and editor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.2" id="Page_ii.2">ii. 2</a></span>
the <i>Argus</i>, and Thomas W. Olcott the able financier of the Regency.
All were displaying a devotion to the President, guided by infinite
tact, that distinguished them as the organisers and disciplinarians of
the party. &quot;I do not believe,&quot; wrote Thurlow Weed, &quot;that a stronger
political organisation ever existed at any state capital, or even at
the national capital. They were men of great ability, great industry,
indomitable courage, and strict personal integrity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>John A. Dix seemed destined from the first to leave an abiding mark in
history. Very early in life he was distinguished for executive
ability. Although but a boy, he saw active service throughout the War
of 1812, having been appointed a cadet at fourteen, an ensign at
fifteen, and a second lieutenant at sixteen. After the war, he served
as aide-de-camp on the staff of General Brown, living at Fortress
Monroe and at Washington, until feeble health led to his resignation
in 1828. Then he began the practice of law at Cooperstown. In 1830,
when Governor Throop made him adjutant-general, he removed to Albany.
He was now twenty-six years old, an accomplished writer, a vigorous
speaker, and as prompt and bold in his decisions as in 1861, when he
struck the high, clear-ringing note for the Union in his order to
shoot the first man who attempted to haul down the American flag. He
was not afraid of any enterprise; he was not abashed by the stoutest
opposition; he was not even depressed by failure. When the call came,
he leaped up to sudden political action, and very soon was installed
as a member of the Regency.</p>

<p>Dix had one great advantage over most of his contemporaries in
political life&#8212;he was able to write editorials for the <i>Argus</i>. It
took a keen pen to find an open way to its columns. Croswell needed
assistance in these days of financial quakings and threatened party
divisions, but he would accept it only from a master. Until this time,
Wright and Marcy had aided him. Their love for variety of subject,
characteristic, perhaps, of the gifted writer, presented widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.3" id="Page_ii.3">ii. 3</a></span>
differing themes, flavoured with humour and satire, making the paper
attractive if not spectacular. To this work Dix, who had already
published a <i>Sketch of the Resources of the City of New York</i>, now
brought the freshness of a strong personality and the training of a
scholar and linguist. He had come into public life under the influence
of Calhoun, for whom the army expressed a decided preference in 1828;
but he never accepted the South Carolinian's theory of nullification.
Dix had inherited loyalty from his father, an officer in the United
States army, and he was quick to strike for his country when South
Carolina raised the standard of rebellion in 1861.</p>

<p>There was something particularly attractive about John A. Dix in these
earlier years. He had endured hardships and encountered dangers, but
he had never known poverty; and after his marriage he no longer
depended upon the law or upon office for life's necessities. Educated
at Phillips Exeter Academy, at the College of Montreal, and at St.
Mary's College in Baltimore, he learned to be vigorous without
egotism, positive without arrogance, and a man of literary tastes
without affectation. Even long years of earnest controversy and
intense feeling never changed the serene purity of his life, his lofty
purposes, or the nobility of his nature. It is doubtful if he would
have found distinction in the career of a man of letters, to which he
was inclined. He had the learning and the scholarly ambition. Like
Benjamin F. Butler, he could not be content with a small measure of
knowledge. He studied languages closely, he read much of the world's
literature in the original, and he could write on political topics
with the firm grasp and profound knowledge of a statesman of broad
views; but he could not, or did not, turn his English into the realm
of literature. Yet his <i>Winter in Madeira and a Summer in Spain and
Florence</i>, published in 1850, ran through five editions in three
years, and is not without interest to-day, after so many others, with,
defter pen, perhaps, have written of these sunny lands. His
appointment as secretary of state in 1833 made him also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.4" id="Page_ii.4">ii. 4</a></span> state
superintendent of common schools, and his valuable reports, published
during the seven years he filled the office, attest his intelligent
devotion to the educational interests of New York, not less than his
editorial work on the <i>Argus</i> showed his loyal attachment to Van
Buren.</p>

<p>But, despite the backing of President Jackson, and the influence of
other powerful friends, there was no crying demand outside of New York
for Van Buren's election to the Presidency. He had done nothing to
stir the hearts of his countrymen with pride, or to create a
pronounced, determined public sentiment in his behalf. On the
contrary, his weaknesses were as well understood without New York as
within it. David Crockett, in his life of Van Buren, speaks of him as
&quot;secret, sly, selfish, cold, calculating, distrustful, treacherous,&quot;
and &quot;as opposite to Jackson as dung is to a diamond.&quot; Crockett's book,
written for campaign effect, was as scurrilous as it was interesting,
but it proved that the country fully understood the character of Van
Buren, and that, unlike Jackson, he had no great, redeeming,
iron-willed quality that fascinates the multitude. Tennessee, the home
State of Jackson, opposed him with bitterness; Virginia declared that
it favoured principles, not men, and that in supporting Van Buren it
had gone as far astray as it would go; Calhoun spoke of the Van Buren
party as &quot;a powerful faction, held together by the hopes of plunder,
and marching under a banner whereon is written 'to the victors belong
the spoils.'&quot; Everywhere there seemed to be unkindness, unrest, or
indifference.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Van Buren's candidacy had been so persistently and
systematically worked up by the President that, from the moment of his
inauguration as Vice President, his succession to the Presidency was
accepted as inevitable. It is doubtful if a man ever slipped into an
office more easily than Martin Van Buren secured the Presidency. That
there might be no failure at the last moment, a national democratic
convention, the second one in the history of the party, was called to
nominate him at Baltimore, in May, 1835, eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.5" id="Page_ii.5">ii. 5</a></span>een months before the
election. When the time came, South Carolina, Alabama, and Illinois
were unrepresented; Tennessee had one delegate, and Mississippi and
Missouri only two each; but Van Buren's nomination followed with an
ease and a unanimity that caused a smile even among the office-holding
delegates.</p>

<p>Indeed, slavery was the only thing in sight to disturb Van Buren. At
present, it was not larger than a cloud &quot;like a man's hand,&quot; but the
agitation had begun seriously to disturb politicians. After the North
had emerged from the Missouri struggle, chafed and mortified by the
treachery of its own representatives, the rapidly expanding culture of
cotton, which found its way in plenty to northern seaports, had
apparently silenced all opposition. A few people, however, had been
greatly disturbed by the arguments of a small number of reformers,
much in advance of their time, who were making a crusade against the
whole system of domestic slavery. Some of these men won honoured names
in our history. One of them was Benjamin Lundy. In 1815, when
twenty-six years old, Lundy organised an anti-slavery association,
known as the &quot;Union Humane Society,&quot; and, in its support, he had
traversed the country from Maine to Tennessee, lecturing, editing
papers, and forming auxiliary societies. He was a small, deaf,
unassuming Quaker, without wealth, eloquence, or marked ability; but
he had courage, tremendous energy, and a gentle spirit. He had lived
for a time in Wheeling, Virginia, where the horrors, inseparable from
slavery, impressed him very much as the system in the British West
Indies had impressed Zachary Macaulay, father of the distinguished
essayist and historian; and, like Macaulay, he ever after devoted his
time and his abilities to the generous task of rousing his countrymen
to a full sense of the cruelties practised upon slaves.</p>

<p>In 1828, he happened to meet William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison's
attention had not previously been drawn to the slavery question, but,
when he heard Lundy's arguments, he joined him in Baltimore,
demanding, in the first issue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.6" id="Page_ii.6">ii. 6</a></span> <i>The Genius</i>, immediate emancipation
as the right of the slave and the duty of the master. William Lloyd
Garrison was young then, not yet twenty-three years of age, but he
struck hard, and soon found himself in jail, in default of the payment
of fifty dollars fine and costs for malicious libel. At the end of
forty-nine days, Arthur Tappan, of New York City, paid the fine, and
Garrison, returning to Boston, issued the first number of <i>The
Liberator</i> on January 1, 1830.</p>

<p>This opened the agitation in earnest. Garrison treated slavery as a
crime, repudiating all creeds, churches, and parties which taught or
accepted the doctrine that an innocent human being, however black or
down-trodden, was not the equal of every other and entitled to the
same inalienable rights. The South soon heard of him, and the Georgia
Legislature passed an act offering a reward of five thousand dollars
for his delivery into that State. Indictments of northern men by
southern grand juries now became of frequent occurrence, one governor
making requisition upon Governor Marcy for the surrender of Arthur
Tappan, although Tappan had never been in a Southern State. The South,
finding that long-distance threats, indictments, and offers of reward
accomplished nothing, waked into action its northern sympathisers, who
appealed with confidence to riot and mob violence. In New York City,
the crusade opened in October, 1833, a mob preventing the organisation
of an anti-slavery society at Clinton Hall. Subsequently, on July 4,
1834, an anti-slavery celebration in Chatham Street chapel was broken
up, and five days later, the residence of Lewis Tappan was forced open
and the furniture destroyed. These outrages were followed by the
destruction of churches, the dismantling of schoolhouses, and the
looting of dwellings, owned or used by coloured people. In October,
1835, a committee of respectable citizens of Utica, headed by Samuel
Beardsley, then a congressman and later chief justice of the State,
broke up a meeting called to organise a state anti-slavery society,
and destroyed the printing press of a democratic journal which had
spoken kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.7" id="Page_ii.7">ii. 7</a></span> of Abolitionists. The agitators, however, were in no
wise dismayed or disheartened. It would have taken a good deal of
persecution to frighten Beriah Green, or to confuse the conscience of
Arthur Tappan.</p>

<p>In the midst of such scenes came tidings that slavery had been
abolished in the British West Indies, and that the Utica indignity had
been signalised by the conversion of Gerrit Smith. Theretofore, Smith
had been a leading colonisationist&#8212;thereafter he was to devote
himself to the principles of abolitionism. Gerrit Smith, from his
earliest years, had given evidence of precocious and extraordinary
intelligence. Thurlow Weed pronounced him &quot;the handsomest, the most
attractive, and the most intellectual young man I ever met.&quot; Smith was
then seventeen years old&#8212;a student in Hamilton College. &quot;He dressed
<i>&#224; la</i> Byron,&quot; continues Weed, &quot;and in taste and manners was
instinctively perfect.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His father was Peter Smith, famous in his
day as one of the largest landowners in the United States; and,
although this enormous estate was left the son in his young manhood,
it neither changed his simple, gentle manners, nor the purpose of his
noble life.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> By profession, Gerrit Smith was a philanthropist, and
in his young enthusiasm he joined the American Colonisation Society,
organised in 1817, for the purpose of settling the western coast of
Africa with emancipated blacks. It was a pre-eminently respectable
association. Henry Clay was its president, and prominent men North and
South, in church and in state, approved its purpose and its methods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.8" id="Page_ii.8">ii. 8</a></span>
In 1820 it purchased Sherbro Island; but finding the location
unfortunate, other lands were secured in the following year at Cape
Mesurado, and about a thousand emigrants sent thither during the next
seven years. Gerrit Smith, however, found the movement too slow, if
not practically stranded, by the work of the cotton-gin and the
doctrine of Calhoun, that &quot;the negro is better off in slavery at the
South than in freedom elsewhere.&quot; So, in 1830, he left the society to
those whose consciences condemned slavery, but whose conservatism
restrained them from offensive activity. The society drifted along
until 1847, when the colony, then numbering six or seven thousand,
declared itself an independent republic under the name of Liberia. In
the meantime, Smith, unaided and alone, had provided homes in northern
States, on farms of fifty acres each, for twice as many emancipated
blacks, his gifts aggregating over two hundred thousand acres.</p>

<p>Gerrit Smith's conversion to abolitionism helped the anti-slavery
cause, much as the conversion of St. Paul benefited the Christian
church. He brought youth, courage, enthusiasm, wealth, and marked
ability. Although alienated from him for years because of his peculiar
creed, Thurlow Weed refers in loving remembrance to &quot;his great
intellect, genial nature, and ample fortune, which were devoted to all
good works.&quot; When the people of Utica, his native town, broke up the
meeting called to form a state anti-slavery society, Smith promptly
invited its projectors to his home at Peterborough, Madison County,
where the organisation was completed. He was thirty-three years old
then, and from that day until Lincoln's proclamation and Lee's
surrender freed the negro, he never ceased to work for the abolition
of slavery. The state organisation, nourished under his fostering
care, led to greater activity. Anti-slavery societies began to form in
every county and in most of the towns of some counties. Abolitionism
did not take the place of anti-Masonry, which was now rapidly on the
wane; but it awakened the conscience, setting people to thinking and,
then, to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.9" id="Page_ii.9">ii. 9</a></span>ing. The great contest to abolish slavery in the British
West Indies, led by the Buxtons, the Wilberforces, and the Whitbreads,
had aroused public indignation in the United States, as well as in
England, by the overwhelming proofs that men and women were being
constantly flogged; and that branding female slaves on the breast with
red-hot iron, was used as a means of punishment, as well as of
identification. Other more revolting evidences of the horrors, which
seemed to be the inevitable accompaniment of the slave system, found
lodgment in American homes through the eloquence of the noted English
abolition lecturer, George Thompson, then in this country; until the
cruelties, characterising slavery in Jamaica, were supposed and
believed by many to be practised in the Southern States.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, the principal avenue between the promoter of
anti-slavery views and the voter was the United States mails, and
these were freighted with abolition documents. It is likely that
Harrison Gray Otis, the wealthy and aristocratic mayor of Boston, did
not exaggerate when he advised the southern magistrate, who desired
the suppression of Garrison's <i>Liberator</i>, that &quot;its office was an
obscure hole, its editor's only visible auxiliary a negro boy, and his
supporters a few insignificant persons of all colours;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the
Southerners knew that from that &quot;obscure hole&quot; issued a paper of
uncompromising spirit, which was profoundly impressing the people of
the United States, and their journals and orators teemed with
denunciations. The Richmond <i>Whig</i> characterised Abolitionists as
&quot;hell-hounds,&quot; warning the northern merchants that unless these
fanatics were hung they would lose the benefit of southern trade. A
Charleston paper threatened to cut out and &quot;cast upon the dunghill&quot;
the tongue of any one who should lecture upon the evils or immorality
of slavery. The Augusta <i>Chronicle</i> declared that if the question be
longer discussed the Southern States would secede and settle the
matter by the sword, as the only possible means of self-preservation.
A prominent Alabama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.10" id="Page_ii.10">ii. 10</a></span> clergyman advised hanging every man who favoured
emancipation, and the Virginia Legislature called upon the
non-slave-holding States to suppress abolition associations by penal
statutes.</p>

<p>In the midst of such sentiments, it was evident to Van Buren, whose
election depended upon the Southern States, that something definite
must be done, and that nothing would be considered definite by the
South which did not aim at the total abolition of the anti-slavery
agitator. Accordingly, his friends held meetings in every county in
the State, adopting resolutions denouncing them as &quot;fanatics and
traitors to their country,&quot; and indorsing Van Buren &quot;as a patriot
opposed to the hellish abolition factions and all their heresies.&quot; Van
Buren himself arranged for the great meeting at Albany at which
Governor Marcy presided. &quot;I send you the inclosed proceedings of the
citizens of Albany,&quot; wrote Van Buren to the governor of Georgia, &quot;and
I authorise you to say that I concur fully in the sentiments they
advance.&quot;</p>

<p>In commenting upon the Albany meeting, Thurlow Weed, with the
foresight of a prophet, wrote in the <i>Evening Journal</i>: &quot;This question
of slavery, when it becomes a matter of political controversy, will
shake, if not unsettle, the foundations of our government. It is too
fearful, and too mighty, in all its bearings and consequences, to be
recklessly mixed up in our partisan conflicts.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> When the
Legislature convened, in January, 1836, Governor Marcy took up the
question in his message. &quot;I cannot doubt,&quot; he said, &quot;that the
Legislature possesses the power to pass such penal laws as will have
the effect of preventing the citizens of this State, and residents
within it, from availing themselves, with impunity, of the protection
of its sovereignty and laws, while they are actually employed in
exciting insurrection and sedition in a sister State, or engaged in
treasonable enterprises, intending to be executed therein.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Not
content with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.11" id="Page_ii.11">ii. 11</a></span> show of loyalty to the South on the part of his
friends, Van Buren secured the support of Silas Wright and Nathaniel
P. Tallmadge for the bill, then pending in the United States Senate,
prohibiting postmasters from knowingly transmitting or delivering any
documents or papers relating to the abolition of slavery, and when the
measure, on a motion for engrossment, received a tie vote, Van Buren
cast the decisive vote in the affirmative.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Van Buren's prompt action gave him the confidence and support of
three-fourths of the slave-holding States, without losing his hold
upon the Democracy of the free States. Indeed, there was nothing new
that the Whigs could oppose to Van Buren. They were not ready to take
the anti-slavery side of the issue, and questions growing out of the
bank controversy had practically been settled in 1832. This,
therefore, was the situation when the two parties in New York
assembled in convention, in September, 1836, to nominate state
candidates. Marcy and John Tracy were without opposition. From the
first moment he began to administer the affairs of the State, Marcy
must have felt that he had found his work at last.</p>

<p>The Whigs were far from being united. Henry Clay's disinclination to
become a nominee for President resulted in two Whig candidates, Hugh
L. White of Tennessee, the favourite of the southern Whigs, and
William Henry Harrison, preferred by the Eastern, Middle, and Western
States. This weakness was soon reflected in New York. Thurlow Weed was
full of forebodings, and William H. Seward found his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.12" id="Page_ii.12">ii. 12</a></span> law office more
satisfactory than a candidate's berth. Like Clay he was perfectly
willing another should bear the burden of inevitable defeat. So the
Whigs put up Jesse Buel for governor, Gamaliel H. Barstow for
lieutenant-governor, and an electoral ticket favourable to Harrison.</p>

<p>Jesse Buel was not a brilliant man. He was neither a thinker, like
Seward, nor an orator, like Granger; but he was wise, wealthy, and
eminently respectable, with enough of the statesman in him to be able
to accept established facts and not to argue with the inexorable.
Years before, he had founded the Albany <i>Argus</i>, editing it with
ability and great success. Through its influence he became state
printer, succeeding Solomon Southwick, after the latter's quarrel with
Governor Tompkins over the Bank of America. This was in 1813. Three
years later Thurlow Weed, then a young man of nineteen, worked for him
as a journeyman printer. &quot;From January till April,&quot; he writes, &quot;I
uniformly reached the office before daylight, and seldom failed to
find Mr. Buel at his case, setting type by a tallow candle and smoking
a long pipe.&quot; Buel made so much money that the party managers invited
him to let others, equally deserving, have a turn at the state
printing. So he went into the Assembly, distinguishing himself as an
able, practical legislator. But he gradually drew away from the
Democrats, as their financial policy became more pronounced; and upon
the organisation of the Whig party gave it his support. Had he chosen
he might have been its candidate for governor in 1834; and it is
difficult to un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.13" id="Page_ii.13">ii. 13</a></span>derstand why he should have accepted, in 1836, with
little expectation of an election, what he declined two years before
when success seemed probable.</p>

<p>Gamaliel H. Barstow had been a Clintonian and an anti-Clintonian, a
follower and a pursuer of Van Buren, an Adams man and an
Anti-Mason&#8212;everything, in fact, except a Federalist. But, under
whatever standard he fought, and in whatever body he sat, he was a
recognised leader, full of spirit, fire, and force. In 1824, he had
stood with James Tallmadge and Henry Wheaton at the head of the Adams
party; in 1831, he had accompanied John C. Spencer and William H.
Seward to the national anti-masonic convention at Baltimore; and, in
the long, exciting debate upon the bill giving the people power to
choose presidential electors, he exhibited the consummate shrewdness
and sagacity of an experienced legislator. There was nothing sinister
or vindictive about him; but he had an unsparing tongue, and he
delighted to indulge it. This is what he did in 1836. Having turned
his back upon the Democratic party, the campaign to him became an
occasion for contrasting the past and &quot;its blighting Regency
majorities&quot; with the future of a new party, which, no doubt, seemed to
him and to others purer and brighter, since the longer it was excluded
from power the less opportunity it had for making mistakes.</p>

<p>But 1836 was a year of great prosperity. The undue depression of 1835
was now succeeded by commercial activity and an era of expansion and
inflation. Visionary schemes were everywhere present. Real estate
values doubled, farms were platted into village lots, wild lands were
turned into farms, and a new impulse was given to legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. Stocks rose, labour went up, farm products
sold at higher prices, and the whole country responded to the
advantages of the money plethora. Democracy rode on the crest of the
wave, and Jackson's financial policy was accepted with joy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Whig party, hoping to strengthen its numbers in
Congress, did not relax its zeal. When the vote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.14" id="Page_ii.14">ii. 14</a></span> however, revealed
nearly thirty thousand majority for Marcy<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the Van Buren
electoral ticket, with ninety-four Democrats in the Assembly and only
one Whig in the Senate, it made Thurlow Weed despair for the Republic.</p>

SEWARD ELECTED GOVERNOR<br />
<br />
1836-1838</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> overwhelming defeat of the Whigs, in 1836, left a single rift in
the dark cloud through which gleamed a ray of substantial hope. It was
plain to the most cautious business man that if banking had been
highly remunerative, with the United States Bank controlling
government deposits, it must become more productive after Jackson had
transferred these deposits to state institutions; and what was plain
to the conservative banker, was equally patent to the reckless
speculator. The legislatures of 1834 and 1835, therefore, became noted
as well as notorious for the large number of bank charters granted. As
the months passed, increased demands for liberal loans created an
increasing demand for additional banks, and the greater the demand the
greater the strife for charters. Under the restraining law of the
State, abundant provision had been made for a fair distribution of
bank stocks; but the dominant party, quick to take an advantage
helpful to its friends, carefully selected commissioners who would
distribute it only among their political followers. At first it went
to merchants or capitalists in the locality of the bank; but
gradually, Albany politicians began to participate, and then,
prominent state officers, judges, legislators and their relatives and
confidential friends, many of whom resold the stock at a premium of
twenty to twenty-five per cent. before the first payment had been
made. Thus, the distribution of stock became a public scandal,
deplored in the messages of the Governor and assailed by the press.
&quot;The unclean drippings of venal legislation,&quot; the New York <i>Evening
Post</i> called it. But no remedy was applied. The Gover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.16" id="Page_ii.16">ii. 16</a></span>nor, in spite of
his regrets, signed every charter the Legislature granted, and the
commissioners, as if ignorant of the provisions to secure a fair
distribution of the stock, continued to evade the law with boldness
and great facility.</p>

<p>Members of the Democratic party in New York City, who believed that
banking, like any other business, ought to be open to competition, had
organised an equal rights party in 1834 to oppose all monopolies, and
the bank restraining law in particular. Several meetings were held
during the summer. Finally, in October, both factions of Tammany Hall
attempted forcibly to control its proceedings, and, in the contest,
the lights were extinguished. The Equal Righters promptly relighted
them with loco-foco or friction matches and continued the meeting.
From this circumstance they were called Locofocos, a name which the
Whigs soon applied to the whole Democratic party.</p>

<p>The Equal Rights party was not long-lived. Two years spanned its
activity, and four or five thousand votes measured its strength; but,
while it lasted, it was earnest and the exponent of good principles.
In 1836, these people held a state convention at Utica, issued a
declaration of principles, and nominated a state and congressional
ticket. In New York City, the centre of their activity, Frederick A.
Tallmadge was put up for state senator and Edward Curtis for Congress,
two reputable Whigs; and, to aid them, the Whig party fused
successfully with the Equal Righters, electing their whole ticket.
This victory was the one ray of hope that came to the Whigs out of the
contest of 1836. It proved that some people were uneasy and resentful.</p>

<p>But other Whig victories were soon to follow. Reference has already
been made to the unprecedented prosperity that characterised the year
1836. This era of expansion and speculative enterprises, which began
with the transfer of government deposits, continued at high pressure
under the influence of the newly chartered banks. With such a money
plethora, schemes and projects expanded and inflated, until success
seemed to turn the heads of the whole population. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.17" id="Page_ii.17">ii. 17</a></span> wild was the
passion for new enterprises, that one had only to announce a scheme to
find people ready to take shares in it. Two per cent. a month did not
deter borrowers who expected to make one hundred per cent. before the
end of the year. In vain did the Governor inveigh against this
&quot;unregulated spirit of speculation.&quot; As the year advanced, men grew
more reckless, until stocks and shares were quickly purchased at any
price without the slightest care as to the risk taken.</p>

<p>The beginning of the end of this epoch of insane speculation was felt,
early in the spring of 1837, by a money pressure of unexampled
severity. Scarcely had its effect reached the interior counties,
before every bank in the country suspended specie payments. Then
confidence gave way, and tens of thousands of people, who had been
wealthy or in comfortable circumstances, waked up to the awful
realisation of their bankruptcy and ruin. The panic of 1837 reached
the proportions of a national calamity. Most men did not then know the
reason for the crash, and the knowledge of those who did, brought
little comfort. But, gradually, the country recognised that the
prosperity of a nation is not increased in proportion to the quantity
of paper money issued, unless such currency be maintained at its full
value, convertible, at pleasure, into hard cash&#8212;the money standard of
the world.</p>

<p>It so happened that the Legislature had not adjourned when the crash
came, and, without a moment's delay, it suspended for one year the
section of the Safety Fund act forbidding banks to issue notes after
refusing to pay them in coin on demand; but it refused to suspend the
act, passed in March, 1835, prohibiting the issue or circulation of
bills under the denomination of five dollars. This left the people
without small bills, and, as New York banks dared not issue them,
necessity forced into circulation foreign bills, issued by solvent and
insolvent banks, the losses from which fell largely upon the poorer
classes who could not discriminate between the genuine and the
spurious. So great was the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.18" id="Page_ii.18">ii. 18</a></span>convenience and loss suffered by the
continuance of this act, that the people petitioned the Governor to
call an extra session of the Legislature for its repeal; but Marcy
declined, for the reason that the Legislature had already refused to
give the banks the desired authority. Thus, the citizens of New York,
staggering under a panic common to the whole country, were compelled
to suffer the additional hardships of an irredeemable, and, for the
most part, worthless currency, known as &quot;shin-plasters.&quot;</p>

<p>In the midst of these &quot;hard times,&quot; occurred the election in November,
1837. The New York municipal election, held in the preceding spring
and resulting, with the help of the Equal Righters, in the choice of a
Whig mayor, had prepared the way for a surprise; yet no one imagined
that a political revolution was imminent. But the suffering people
were angry, and, like a whirlwind, the Whigs swept nearly every county
in the State. Of one hundred and twenty-eight assemblymen, they
elected one hundred and one, and six of the eight senators. It
happened, too, that as the triennial election of sheriffs and clerks
occurred this year, the choice of these officers swelled the triumph
into a victory that made it the harder to overthrow. In a moment, the
election of 1837 had given the Whigs a powerful leverage in local
contests, enabling them to build up a party that could be disciplined
as well as organised. To add to their strength, the Legislature, when
it convened, in January, 1838, proceeded to take the &quot;spoils.&quot; Luther
Bradish was chosen speaker, Orville L. Holley surveyor-general, and
Gamaliel L. Barstow state treasurer. It also suspended for two years
the act prohibiting banks from issuing small bills, passed a general
banking law, and almost unanimously voted four millions for enlarging
the Erie canal.</p>

<p>Although the spring elections of 1838 showed a decided falling off in
the Whig vote, hopes of carrying the State in November were so well
founded that Whig candidates for governor appeared in plenty. Looking
back upon the contest from a distance, especially with the present
knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.19" id="Page_ii.19">ii. 19</a></span> of his superlative fitness for high place, it seems strange
that William H. Seward should not have had an open way in the
convention. But Francis Granger had also won the admiration of his
party by twice leading a forlorn hope. Amidst crushing defeat he had
never shown weariness, and his happy disposition kept him in friendly
touch with his party. The Chenango people were especially ardent in
his support. Twice he had forced their canal project through a hostile
Assembly, and they did not forget that, in the hour of triumph, Seward
opposed it. Besides, Granger had distinguished himself in Congress,
resisting the policy of Jackson and Van Buren with forceful argument
and ready tact. He was certainly a man to be proud of, and his
admirers insisted with great pertinacity that he should now be the
nominee for governor.</p>

<p>There was another formidable candidate in the field. Luther Bradish
had proved an unusually able speaker, courteous in deportment, and
firm and resolute in his rulings at a time of considerable political
excitement. He had entered the Assembly from Franklin in 1828, and,
having early embraced anti-Masonry with Weed, Granger, and Seward,
was, with them, a leader in the organisation of the Whig party. The
northern counties insisted that his freedom from party controversies
made him peculiarly available, and, while the supporters of other
candidates were quarrelling, it was their intention, if possible, to
nominate him. Seward and Granger were eager for the nomination, but
neither seems to have encouraged the ill-will which their followers
exhibited. Indeed, Seward evidenced a disposition to withdraw; and he
would doubtless have done so, had not his friends, and those of
Granger, thought it better to let a convention decide. As the campaign
grew older, the canvass proceeded with asperity. Granger's adherents
accused Seward of an unjust conspiracy to destroy him, and of having
canvassed the State, personally or by agents, to secure the prize even
at the cost of a party division. They charged him with oppressing the
settlers in Chautauqua, with editing the Albany <i>Journal</i>, with
regulat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.20" id="Page_ii.20">ii. 20</a></span>ing the Bank of the United States, and controlling the
movements of Henry Clay. &quot;I am already so wearied of it,&quot; Seward
wrote, &quot;that, if left to myself, I should withdraw instantly and
forever. I am ill-fitted for competition with brethren and friends.
But with a clear conscience and greater magnanimity than there is
manifested toward me, I shall go safely through all this storm.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The confidence disclosed in the closing sentence was due largely to
his confidence in Thurlow Weed. The editor of the Albany <i>Journal</i>
seriously desired to take no part in the choice of delegates, since
his personal and political relations with all the candidates were
intimate and confidential; but he had known Granger longer than the
others, and, if controlled by personal friendship, he must have
favoured the Ontario candidate. Weed, however, believed that Seward's
nomination would awaken greater enthusiasm, especially among young
men, thus giving the ticket its best chance of success. At the last
moment, therefore, he declared in favour of the Auburn statesman.</p>

<p>The sequel showed that his help came none too soon. Four informal
ballots were taken, and, on the following day the formal and final
one. The first gave Seward 52, Granger 39, and Bradish 29, with 4 for
Edwards of New York. This was supposed to be Granger's limit. On the
second ballot, Bradish's friends transferred thirteen votes to him,
making Seward 60, Granger 52, Bradish 10, and Edwards 3. If this was a
surprise to the friends of Seward, the third ballot was a tremendous
shock, for Seward fell off to 59, and Granger got 60. Bradish had 8.
Then Weed went to work. Though he had understood that Granger, except
in a few counties, had little strength, the last ballot plainly showed
him to be the popular candidate; and during an intermission between
the third and fourth ballots, the <i>Journal's</i> editor exhibited an
influence few men in the State have ever exercised. The convention was
made up of the strongest and most independent men in the party. Nearly
all had held seats in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.21" id="Page_ii.21">ii. 21</a></span> the state or national legislature, or had
occupied other important office. Experience had taught them to act
upon their own convictions. The delegates interested in the Chenango
Valley canal were especially obstinate and formidable. &quot;Weed,&quot; said
one of them, &quot;tell me to do anything else; tell me to jump out of the
window and break my neck, and I will do it to oblige you; but don't
ask me to desert Granger!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Yet the quiet, good-natured Weed, his
hand softly purring the knee of his listener as he talked&#8212;never
excited, never vehement, but sympathetic, logical, prophetic&#8212;had his
way. The fourth ballot gave Seward 67, Granger 48, Bradish 8. The work
was done. When the convention reassembled the next morning, on motion
of a warm supporter of Granger, the nomination was made unanimous, and
Bradish was named for lieutenant-governor by acclamation.</p>

<p>Much disappointment was exhibited by Granger's friends, especially the
old anti-Mason farmers who were inclined to reproach Weed with
disloyalty. Granger himself stoically accepted defeat and zealously
supported the ticket. He had said to a departing delegate, &quot;if either
Mr. Seward or Mr. Bradish attain a majority at the informal ballot, my
friends must give the successful competitor their united support.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
How heartily Seward would have responded under like circumstances is
evidenced by his action when a premature report went forth of
Granger's selection. Being informed of it, Seward at once told his
friends that Auburn must be the first to ratify, and immediately set
to work preparing resolutions for the meeting.</p>

<p>Thurlow Weed was pre-eminently a practical politician. He believed in
taking advantage of every opportunity to strengthen his own party and
weaken the adversary, and he troubled himself little about the means
employed. He preferred to continue the want of small bills for another
year rather than allow the opposite party to benefit by a repeal of
the obnoxious law; he approved Van Buren's course in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.22" id="Page_ii.22">ii. 22</a></span> infamous
Fellows-Allen controversy; and, had he been governor in place of John
Jay in 1800, the existing Legislature would undoubtedly have been
reconvened in extra session, and presidential electors chosen
favourable to his own party, as Hamilton wanted. But, at the bottom of
his nature, there was bed-rock principle from which no pressure could
swerve him. He could exclaim with Emerson, &quot;I will say those things
which I have meditated for their own sake and not for the first time
with a view to that occasion.&quot; In these words is the secret of his
relation to the Whig party. He asked no office, and he gave only the
ripe fruit of his meditative life. It is not to be supposed that, in
1838, he saw in the young man at Auburn the astute United States
Senator of the fifties; or the still greater secretary of state of the
Civil War; but he had seen enough of Seward to discern the qualities
of mind and heart that lifted him onto heights which extended his
horizon beyond that of most men, enabling him to keep his bearing in
the midst of great excitement, and, finally, in the presence of war
itself. Seward saw fewer things, perhaps, than the more active and
eloquent Granger, but Weed knew that he saw more deeply.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Democratic state convention assembled at Herkimer on September 12,
and unanimously renominated William L.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.23" id="Page_ii.23">ii. 23</a></span> Marcy and John Tracy. Marcy
had made an able governor for three consecutive terms. His declaration
that &quot;to the victors belong the spoils&quot; had not impaired his
influence, since all parties practised, if they did not preach it;
and, although he stultified himself by practically recommending and
finally approving the construction of the Chenango canal, which he
bitterly opposed as comptroller, he had lost no friends. Canal
building was in accord with the spirit of the times. A year later, he
had recommended an enlargement of the Erie canal; but when he
discovered that the Chenango project would cost two millions instead
of one, and the Erie enlargement twelve millions instead of six, he
protested against further improvements until the Legislature provided
means for paying interest on the money already borrowed. He clearly
saw that the &quot;unregulated spirit of speculation&quot; would lead to ruin;
and, to counteract it, he appealed to the Legislature, seeking to
influence the distribution of bank stock along lines set forth in the
law. But Marcy failed to enforce his precepts with the veto. In
refusing, also, to reassemble the Legislature, for the repeal of the
Small Bills act, the passage of which he had recommended in 1835, he
gave the <i>Evening Post</i> opportunity to assail him as &quot;a weak,
cringing, indecisive man, the mere tool of a monopoly junto&#8212;their
convenient instrument.&quot;</p>

<p>Marcy held office under difficult conditions. The panic, coming in the
summer of 1837, was enough to shatter the nerves of any executive;
but, to the panic, was now added the Canadian rebellion which occurred
in the autumn of 1837. Though not much of a rebellion, William L.
McKenzie's appeal for aid to the friends of liberty aroused hundreds
of sympathetic Americans living along the border. Navy Island, above
the Falls of Niagara, was made the headquarters of a provisional
government, from which McKenzie issued a proclamation offering a
reward for the capture of the governor-general of Canada and promising
three hundred acres of land to each recruit.</p>

<p>The Canadian authorities effectually guarded the border,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.24" id="Page_ii.24">ii. 24</a></span> and
destroyed the <i>Caroline</i>, presumably an insurgent steamer, lying at
Schlosser's dock on the American side. In the conflict, one member of
the crew was killed, and several wounded. The steamer proved to be an
American vessel, owned by New York parties, and its destruction
greatly increased the indignation against Canada; but Governor Marcy
did not hesitate to call upon the people to refrain from unlawful acts
within the territory of the United States; and, to enforce his
proclamation, supplied General Scott, now in command of the Canadian
frontier, with a force of militia. The American troops quickly forced
the abandonment of Navy Island, scattered the insurgents and their
allies to secret retreats, and broke up the guerrilla warfare. The
loss of life among the patriots, due to their audacity and incompetent
leadership, was considerable, and the treatment of prisoners harsh and
in some instances inhuman. Many young men of intelligence and
character were banished for life to Van Dieman's Land, McKenzie was
thrown into a Canadian dungeon, and, among others, Van Schoulty, a
brave young officer and refugee from Poland, who led an unsuccessful
attack upon Prescott, was executed. Small as was the uprising, it
created an intense dislike of Marcy among the friends of those who
participated in it.</p>

<p>Still another political splinter was festering in Marcy's side.
Several leading Democrats, who had sustained Jackson in his war upon
the United States Bank, and in his removal of the deposits, refused to
adopt Van Buren's sub-treasury scheme, proposed to the extra session
of Congress, convened in September, 1837. This measure meant the
disuse of banks as fiscal agents of the government, and the
collection, safekeeping, and disbursement of public moneys by treasury
officials. The banks, of course, opposed it; and thousands who had
shouted, &quot;Down with the United States Bank,&quot; changed their cry to
&quot;Down with Van Buren and the sub-treasury scheme.&quot; Among those
opposing it, in New York, Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, a Democratic United
States senator, took the lead, calling a state convention to meet at
Syracuse. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.25" id="Page_ii.25">ii. 25</a></span> convention immediately burned its bridges. It
denounced Van Buren, it opposed Marcy, and it indorsed Seward. Behind
it were bank officers and stockholders who were to lose the privilege
of loaning the money of the United States for their own benefit, and
the harder it struck them the more liberally they paid for fireworks
and for shouters.</p>

<p>If trouble confronted the Democrats, discouragement oppressed the
Whigs. Under the direction of Gerrit Smith the Abolitionists were on
the war-path, questioning Seward as to the propriety of granting
fugitive slaves a fair trial by jury, of abolishing distinctions in
constitutional rights founded solely on complexion, and of repealing
the law authorising the importation of slaves into the State and their
detention as such during a period of nine months. Seward avowed his
firm faith in trial by jury and his opposition to all &quot;human bondage,&quot;
but he declined making ante-election pledges. He preferred to wait, he
said, until each case came before him for decision. Seward undoubtedly
took the wise course; but he did not satisfy the extremists
represented by Smith, and many of the Whig leaders became
panic-stricken. &quot;The Philistines are upon us,&quot; wrote Millard Fillmore,
who was canvassing the State. &quot;I now regard all as lost irrevocably.
We shall never be able to burst the withes. Thank God, I can endure it
as long as they, but I am sick of our Whig party. It can never be in
the ascendant.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Francis Granger was no less alarmed. He estimated the Abolitionist
vote at twenty thousand, &quot;and before the grand contest of 1840,&quot; he
wrote Weed, &quot;they will control one-fourth the votes of the State. They
are engaged in it with the same honest purpose that governed the great
mass of Anti-Masons.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The young candidate at Auburn was also in
despair. &quot;I fear the State is lost,&quot; he wrote Weed on November 4.
&quot;This conclusion was forced upon me strongly by news from the southern
tier of counties, and is confirmed by an analogy in Ohio. But I will
not stop to reason on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.26" id="Page_ii.26">ii. 26</a></span> causes. Your own sagacity has doubtless
often considered them earlier and more forcibly than mine.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But Horace Greeley did not share these gloomy forebodings. He was then
engaged in editing the <i>Jeffersonian</i>, a weekly journal of eight
pages, which had been established in February solely as a campaign
newspaper. His regular business was the publication of the <i>New
Yorker</i>, a journal of literature and general intelligence. During the
campaign he consented to spend two days of each week at Albany making
up the <i>Jeffersonian</i>, which was issued from the office of the
<i>Evening Journal</i>, and he was doing this work with the indefatigable
industry and marvellous ability that marked his character.</p>

<p>Greeley had battled for a place in the world after the manner of
Thurlow Weed. He was born on a New Hampshire farm, he had worked on a
Vermont farm, and for a time it seemed to him as if he must forever
remain on a farm; but after a few winters of schooling he started over
the Vermont hills to learn the printer's trade. A boy was not needed
in Whitehall, and he pushed on to Poultney. There he found work for
four years until the <i>Northern Spectator</i> expired. Then he went back
to the farm. But newspaper life in a small town had made him ambitious
to try his fortunes in a city, and, journeying from one printing
office to another, he finally drifted, in 1831, at the age of twenty,
into New York.</p>

<p>Up to this time Greeley's life had resembled Weed's only in his
voracious appetite for reading newspapers. He cared little for the
boys about town and less for the sports of youth; he could dispense
with sleep, and wasted no time thinking about what he should eat or
wear; but books, and especially newspapers, were read with the avidity
that a well-fed threshing machine devours a stack of wheat. He seemed
to have only one ambition&#8212;the acquisition of knowledge and the career
of a man of letters, and in his efforts to succeed, he ignored forms
and social usages, forgot that he had a physical body to care for, and
detested man-worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.27" id="Page_ii.27">ii. 27</a></span> Standing at last before a printer's case on
Broadway, he was able to watch, almost from the beginning, the great
political drama in which he was destined to play so great a part.
Seward had just entered the State Senate; Weed, having recently
established the <i>Evening Journal</i>, was massing the Anti-Masons and
National Republicans for their last campaign; William Lloyd Garrison
had issued the first number of the <i>Liberator</i>; Gerrit Smith, already
in possession of his father's vast estate, still clung to the Liberian
colonisation scheme; and Van Buren, not yet returned from England, was
about entering upon the last stage of his phenomenally successful
political career. Politicians for the first time disturbed about the
tariff, the bank, and internal improvements, had come to the parting
of the ways; the old order of things had ended under John Quincy
Adams&#8212;the new had just commenced under Andrew Jackson. But the young
compositor needed no guide-post to direct his political footsteps. In
1834, he had established the <i>New Yorker</i> and those who read it became
Whigs. His mind acted upon other minds of a certain constitution with
wonderful magnetism, attracting thousands of readers by his marvellous
gift of expression and the broad sympathies and clear discernments
that characterised his writings. He had his own ideas about the
necessity for reforms, and he seems easily to have fallen a victim to
countless delusions and illusions which young visionaries and
gray-headed theorists brought to him; but, in spite of remonstrances
and crushing opposition, he stood resolutely for whatever awoke the
strongest emotions of his nature.</p>

<p>Thurlow Weed had been a constant reader of the <i>New Yorker</i>. He did
not know the name of its editor and had never taken the trouble to
inquire, but when a cheap weekly Whig newspaper was needed for a
vigorous campaign in 1838, the editor of the <i>New Yorker</i>, whoever he
might be, seemed the proper man to edit and manage it. Going to New
York, he called at the Ann Street office and found himself in the
presence of a young man, slender, light-haired, slightly stooping, and
very near-sighted, who introduced himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.28" id="Page_ii.28">ii. 28</a></span> Horace Greeley. At the
moment, he was standing at the case, with coat off and sleeves rolled
up, setting type with the ease and rapidity of an expert. &quot;When I
informed him of the object of my visit,&quot; says Weed, &quot;he was, of
course, surprised, but evidently gratified. Nor was his surprise and
gratification diminished to learn that I was drawn to him without any
other reason or information but such as I had derived from the columns
of the <i>New Yorker</i>. He suggested the <i>Jeffersonian</i> as the name for
the new paper, and the first number appeared in February, 1838.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It is one of the privileges of genius to discern the genius of others;
but even Thurlow Weed could not have dreamed that he was giving
opportunity to a man whose name was to rank higher than his own in
history. There was a certain affinity between the intellectual nature
of the two men, and they had now a common object. Both were
journalists of tremendous energy, indomitable industry, and marvellous
gifts; but Weed was a politician, Greeley a political preacher. Weed's
influence lay in his remarkable judgment, his genius for diplomacy,
and his rare gift of controlling individuals by personal appeal and by
the overpowering mastery of his intellect; Greeley's supremacy grew
out of his broad sympathies with the human race and his matchless
ability to write. Weed's field of operations was confined largely to
the State of New York and to delegates and men of influence who
assemble at national conventions; Greeley preached to the whole
country, sweeping along like a prairie fire and converting men to his
views as easily as steel filings are attracted to the magnet. From the
outset he was above dictation. He lacked judgment, and at times
greatly grieved the friends who were willing to follow him through
fire and flood; but once his mind was made up he surrendered his
understanding, his consciousness of convictions, of duty, and of
public good, to no man or set of men. &quot;I trust we can never be
enemies,&quot; he once wrote Weed, &quot;but better anything than I should feel
the weight of chains about my neck, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.29" id="Page_ii.29">ii. 29</a></span> I should write and act with
an eye to any man's pleasure, rather than to the highest good.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>As the editor of the <i>Jeffersonian</i>, which now quickly won a multitude
of readers, he did his work with marked ability, discussing measures
calmly and forcibly, and with an influence that baffled his opponents
and surprised his friends. Greeley seems never to have been an
immature writer. His felicity of expression and ability to shade
thought, with a power of appeal and invective that belongs to
experience and mature age, came to him, as they did to Hamilton,
before he was out of his teens, and whether he was right or whether he
was wrong, he was always the most interesting, always the most
commanding figure in American journalism in the epoch-making political
controversies of his day.</p>

<p>The Whigs thought it a happy omen that election day, November 7, came
this year on the anniversary of General Harrison's victory at
Tippecanoe. As the returns came in Seward's friends grew more elated,
and on Saturday, the 11th, Weed covered the entire first page of the
<i>Evening Journal</i> with the picture of an eagle, having outspread wings
and bearing in its beak the word &quot;Victory.&quot; It was the first
appearance in politics of this American bird, which was destined to
play a part in all future celebrations of the kind. The completed
returns showed that the Whigs had elected Seward and Bradish by ten
thousand four hundred and twenty-one majority,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> five of the eight
senators, and nearly two-thirds of the assemblymen. &quot;Well, dear
Seward,&quot; wrote Weed, &quot;we are victorious; God be thanked&#8212;gratefully
and devoutly thanked.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Seward was no less affected. &quot;It is a
fearful post I have coveted,&quot; he wrote; &quot;I shudder at my temerity....
Indeed, I feel just now as if your zeal had been blind; but I may,
perhaps, get over this. God grant, at all events, that I be spared
from committing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.30" id="Page_ii.30">ii. 30</a></span> the sin of ingratitude. I hate it as the foulest in
the catalogue.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Marcy seemed to accept his defeat good-naturedly. &quot;Even before the
ballot-boxes were closed,&quot; he wrote, facetiously, &quot;I had partly
persuaded myself to engage in a work for <i>my</i> posterity, by writing
the history of the rise, progress, and termination of the Regency. It
will embrace the transactions of the golden days of the Republic
(Empire State). It began with my entrance into public life, and
terminates with my exit from it. The figures in the tableau will not
be of the largest size, but the ascendancy of honest men, for such I
think them to have been (<i>Ilium fuit</i>), will be interesting on account
of great rarity.&quot; But, to the same friend, a few weeks later, he took
a desponding view, expressing the fear that the power which had passed
from the Democratic party would not return to as honest hands. His
financial condition, too, caused him much uneasiness. He had given
eighteen years to the State, he said, the largest portion of an active
and vigorous life, and now found himself poorer than when he took
office. &quot;If my acquisitions in a pecuniary way have probably been less
and my labours and exertions greater,&quot; he asks, &quot;what compensating
advantages are to be brought into the calculation to balance the
account?&quot; An office-holder rarely asks such a question until thrown
out of a position; while in office, it is evident he thinks the
privilege of holding it sufficient compensation; otherwise, it may be
presumed, he would resign. Marcy, however, was not forgotten. Indeed,
his political career had scarcely begun, since the governorship became
only a stepping-stone to continued honours. Within a few months,
President Van Buren appointed him, under the convention of April,
1839, to the Mexican Claims Commission, and a few years later he was
to become a member of two Cabinets.</p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">After</span> Seward's election, the Whig party in New York may be fairly
described as under the control of Thurlow Weed, who became known as
the &quot;Dictator.&quot; Although no less drastic and persevering, perhaps,
than DeWitt Clinton's, it was a control far different in method.
Clinton did not disguise his power. He was satisfied in his own mind
that he knew better than any other how to guide his party and govern
his followers, and he acted accordingly&#8212;dogmatic, overbearing, often
far from amiable, sometimes unendurable, to those around him. Weed, on
the contrary, was patient, sympathetic, gentle, and absolutely without
asperity. &quot;My dear Weed,&quot; wrote Seward on December 14, 1838, &quot;the
sweetness of his temper inclines me to love my tyrant. I had no idea
that dictators were such amiable creatures.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In a humourous vein,
William Kent, the gifted son of the Chancellor, addressed him. &quot;Mr.
Dictator, the whole State is on your shoulders. I take it, some future
chronicler, in reciting the annals of New York during this period, in
every respect equal to England in the time of Elizabeth, will devote
the brightest colours to 'the celebrated Thurlow Weed, who so long
filled the office of Governor Seward during his lengthened and
prosperous administration.' It behooves you, therefore, to act
circumspectly, and particularly in the advice you give the Governor as
to appointments to office.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.32" id="Page_ii.32">ii. 32</a></span></p><p>Few chapters of personal history can be more interesting than that
which tells of the strange, subtle influence exercised by Weed over
the mind of Seward; but it is doubtful if there was conscious control
at any time. Certainly Seward never felt &quot;the weight of chains&quot; about
his neck. Weed probably saw good reason to believe that in Seward he
could have just the sort of an associate who would suit all his
purposes, since their views of public affairs and their estimate of
public men rarely differed. &quot;Our relations had become so intimate,&quot; he
says, &quot;and our sentiments and sympathies proved so congenial, that our
interests, pursuits, and hopes of promoting each other's welfare and
happiness became identical.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Weed seemed to glory in Seward's
success, and Seward was supremely happy in and proud of Weed's
friendship. Weed and Greeley were so differently constituted that,
between them, such a relation could not exist, although at times it
seemed to give Greeley real pain that it was so. &quot;I rise early from a
bed of sleepless thought,&quot; he once wrote Weed, &quot;to explain that we
differ radically on the bank question, and I begin to fear we do on
the general policy and objects of political controversy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But
there were no such sleepless nights for Seward. Looking back upon four
years of gubernatorial life, he opens his heart freely to the friend
of his young manhood. &quot;Without your aid,&quot; he declares, &quot;how helpless
would have been my prospect of reaching the elevation from which I am
to-day descending. How could I have sustained myself there; how could
I have secured the joyous reflections of this hour, but for the
confidence I so undenyingly reposed on your affection?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It was not
Seward's nature to depend upon somebody to have his path in life or
his ways of thinking pointed out to him; nor did he have the weakness
of many highly cultured and gifted men who believe too much in the
supremacy of intellect and culture. On the contrary, he had a way of
speaking out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.33" id="Page_ii.33">ii. 33</a></span> own honest thoughts, and would have despised
himself, as much as would Greeley, if it had been necessary to enjoy
any one's friendship on terms of humiliation. It was his nature, as
well as his wish, to share with Weed the benefit of the latter's
almost infallible judgment in political matters. In this way, Weed,
more than either realised, had great influence with Seward. But Weed
was no more the directing mind of the administration of Seward than
was Hamilton of Washington's, or Van Buren of Jackson's, or Seward of
Lincoln's. Many anecdotes were told illustrative of this influence,
which serve to show how strongly the notion obtained in the minds of
the common people that Weed was really &quot;the Dictator.&quot; The best,
associated Seward with his invariable custom of riding outside the
coach while smoking his after-dinner cigar. The whip, on this
occasion, did not know the distinguished traveller, and, after
answering Seward's many questions, attempted to discover the identity
of his companion. The Governor disclaimed being a merchant, a
lecturer, a minister, or a teacher. &quot;Then I know what you are,&quot; said
the driver; &quot;you must be a lawyer, or you wouldn't ask so many
questions.&quot; &quot;That is not my business at present,&quot; replied Seward.
&quot;Then who are you?&quot; finally demanded Jehu. &quot;I am the governor of this
State,&quot; replied Seward. The driver at once showed incredulity, and the
Governor offered to leave it to the landlord at the next tavern. On
arriving there, and after exchanging salutations, Seward suggested the
question in dispute. &quot;No, you are not the governor,&quot; replied the
landlord, to the great satisfaction of the driver. &quot;What!&quot; exclaimed
Seward, in astonishment; &quot;then who is governor?&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; said the
landlord, &quot;Thurlow Weed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>&quot;Though the incident never occurred,&quot; says Frederick W. Seward, in the
biography of his father, &quot;the story was so accordant with his habit of
riding outside to smoke, and with the popular understanding of his
relations with Mr. Weed, that it was generally accepted as true.
Seward him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.34" id="Page_ii.34">ii. 34</a></span>self used laughingly to relate it, and say that, though it
was not quite true, it ought to be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>With Governor Seward's inauguration the Whig party was placed on
trial. Ten years had passed since DeWitt Clinton's death, and Seward
was the first successor whose opinions and sentiments harmonised with
those of that distinguished statesman. During the intervening period
the Regency had been in absolute control of the State. It had
contented itself with looking after things as they existed, rather
than undertaking further improvements and reforms. Seward's election,
therefore, was not only a revolution of parties, but a radical change
of policy. Every Whig, fearful lest some misstep might lead to the
early loss of the power just gained, had an opinion as to what should
and should not be done. Some were afraid the Governor would say too
much, others fearful he would say too little. Seward, moving on broad
lines of economics and reform, believed that the promotion of
transportation, the development of capital and credit, and the
enlargement of educational advantages, would bring wealth to the State
and greater happiness to the people; and his first message contained
the policy that guided him throughout his entire political career. In
its preparation, he relied upon President Knott of Union College for
assistance on the subject of education; on John H. Beach for financial
statistics; on Samuel B. Ruggles for canal figures; and on John C.
Spencer for general suggestions. Then he sat down with Weed for its
final revision. When completed, it contained the groundwork of his
political philosophy. He would prosecute the work of the canals, he
would encourage the completion of railroads, establish a board of
internal improvement, extend charitable institutions, improve the
discipline of prisons, elevate the standard of education in schools
and colleges, establish school district libraries, provide for the
education of the coloured race, reform the practice of courts, cut off
superfluous offices, repeal the Small Bills law, authorise banking
under general laws, and apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.35" id="Page_ii.35">ii. 35</a></span> rigorous safeguards, especially in
populous cities, for the purity of the ballot-box. In concluding, he
paid a handsome tribute to DeWitt Clinton and recommended that a
monument be erected to his memory in Albany.</p>

<p>None of our statesmen, with whom reform has been a characteristic
trait, was more devoted or happy. His delight, deep and unfailing,
extended to every department of the government, and the minuteness of
his knowledge betrayed the intimate acquaintance which he had gained
of the affairs of the State during his four years in the Senate. His
message caught the inspiration of this fresh and joyous maturity. It
was written, too, in the easy, graceful style, rhythmical and subdued
in expression, which afterward contributed to his extreme charm as an
orator. From the first, Seward was an ardent optimist, and this first
message is that of noble youth, delighting in the life and the
opportunities that a great office presents to one who is mindful of
its harassing duties and its relentless limitations, yet keenly
sensitive to its novelty and its infinite incitements. The Democrats,
whose hearts must have rejoiced when they heard his message, declared
it the visionary schemes of a theorising politician, the work of a
sophomore rather than a statesman; yet, within little more than a
decade, most of his suggestions found a place in the statute book.
Though the questions of that time are not the questions of our day,
and engage only the historian and his readers, these twenty printed
pages of recommendations, certain to excite debate and opposition,
must always be read with deep enjoyment.</p>

<p>The chief criticism of his opponents grew out of his acceptance of
Ruggles's estimate that the canals would more than reimburse the cost
of their construction and enlargement. The <i>Argus</i> asserted that
Seward, instead of sustaining the policy of &quot;pay as you go,&quot; favoured
a &quot;forty million debt;&quot; and this became the great campaign cry of the
Democrats in two elections. On the other hand, the Whigs maintained
that the canals had enriched the people and the State, and that their
future prosperity depended upon the enlarge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.36" id="Page_ii.36">ii. 36</a></span>ment of the Erie canal, so
that its capacity would meet the increasing demands of business. In
the end, the result showed how prophetically Seward wrote and how
wisely Ruggles figured; for, although the Erie canal, in 1862, had
cost $52,491,915.74, it had repaid the State with an excess of
$42,000,000.</p>

<p>In the midst of so many recommendations, one wonders that Seward had
nothing to say for civil service reform. We may doubt, and with
reason, whether anything he might have said could have strengthened
the slight hold which such a theory then had in the minds of the
people, but it would have brought the need of reform strikingly before
the country to bear, in time, ripe fruit. The Whig party, however, was
not organised to keep Democrats in office, and no sooner had the
Albany <i>Journal</i> announced Seward's election than applications began
pouring in upon the Governor-elect until more than one thousand had
been filed. Seward afterward said that, of these applications, only
two came from persons living west of Cayuga Bridge, although the
eighth district had given him a majority equal to his entire majority
in the State.</p>

<p>Under the Constitution of 1821, there were more places to fill by
appointment than under the Constitution of 1846, and twice as many as
now exist. In 1839, the Governor not only appointed port-wardens,
harbour-masters, notaries public, and superintendents and
commissioners of various sorts, but he nominated judges, surrogates,
county clerks, examiners of prisons, weighers of merchandise,
measurers of grain, cullers of staves, and inspectors of flour,
lumber, spirits, salt, beef and pork, hides and skins, and fish and
oil, besides numerous other officers. They applied formally to the
Governor and then went to Weed to get the place. Just so the Whig
legislators went through the form of holding a caucus to select state
officers after the slate had been made up. John C. Spencer became
secretary of state; Bates Cook of Niagara County, comptroller; Willis
Hall of New York City, attorney-general; Jacob Haight, treasurer; and
Orville L. Holley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.37" id="Page_ii.37">ii. 37</a></span> surveyor-general. Thurlow Weed's account, read
with the knowledge that he alone selected them, is decidedly
humourous. &quot;Bates Cook had but a local reputation,&quot; he says, &quot;and it
required the strongest assurances from Governor Seward and myself that
he was abundantly qualified.&quot; In other words, it was necessary for the
caucus to know that Weed wanted him. &quot;The canvass for attorney-general
was very spirited,&quot; he continues, &quot;Joshua A. Spencer of Oneida and
Samuel Stevens of Albany being the most prominent candidates;&quot; but
Willis Hall, &quot;who was better known on the stump than at the bar, and
whose zeal, energy, and tact had been conspicuous and effective in
overthrowing the Democratic party,&quot; got the office. Van Buren could
not have surpassed this for practical politics. &quot;The nomination of
Jacob Haight,&quot; he goes on, &quot;afforded me great satisfaction. I had
learned in my boyhood at Catskill to esteem and honour him. In 1824
when, as a Democratic senator, he arrayed himself against William H.
Crawford, the caucus nominee for President, and zealously supported
John Quincy Adams, my early remembrances of him grew into a warm
personal friendship.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It was easy to fuse in Weed's big heart
Democratic apostacy and the associations of boyhood.</p>

<p>Yet Weed had able indorsers behind his candidates. &quot;I hear there is
great opposition to Willis Hall,&quot; wrote William Kent, &quot;and I am sorry
for it. He has a great heart, and a great head, too. It has been his
misfortune, but our good fortune, that his time and talents have been
devoted to advancing the Whig party, while those who oppose him were
taxing costs and filing demurrers. The extreme Webster men in New York
have formed a combination against Willis. It is the dog in the manger,
too, for no man from New York is a candidate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But the dictator made a greater display of practical politics in the
selection of a United States senator to succeed Nathaniel P.
Tallmadge. There were several aspirants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.38" id="Page_ii.38">ii. 38</a></span> among them Millard Fillmore,
John C. Spencer, John A. Collier, and Joshua A. Spencer. All these men
were intensely in earnest. Fillmore, then in Congress, was chairman of
the Committee on Ways and Means; and advancement to the Senate would
have been a deserved promotion. But Tallmadge had rallied to the
support of Seward, under the name of Conservatives, many former
National Republicans, who had joined the Democratic party because of
anti-Masonry, and Weed believed in keeping them in the Whig party by
reelecting their leader. Fillmore, and other candidates, earnestly
protested against the policy of discarding tried and faithful friends,
and of conferring the highest and most important place in the gift of
the party upon a new recruit whose fidelity could not be trusted;
&quot;but, strong as those gentlemen were in the Whig party, they were
unable to overcome a conviction in the minds of the Whig members of
the Legislature,&quot; says Weed, solemnly, as if the Whig members of the
Legislature really did have something to do with it, &quot;that in view of
the approaching presidential election Mr. Tallmadge was entitled to
their support. He was, therefore, nominated with considerable
unanimity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It was a great shock to Fillmore, which he resented a
few years later. Indeed, Weed's dictatorship, although quiet and
gentle, was already raising dissent. Albert H. Tracy, indignant at
Seward's nomination over the heads of older and more experienced men,
had withdrawn from politics, and Gamaliel H. Barstow, the first state
treasurer elected by the Whigs, resigned in a huff because he did not
like the way things were going. Weed fully realised the situation.
&quot;There are a great many disappointed, disheartened friends,&quot; he wrote
Granger. &quot;It has been a tremendous winter. But for the presidential
question which will absorb all other things, the appointments would
tear us to pieces.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> To his door, Seward knew, the censure of the
disappointed would be aimed. &quot;The list of appointments made this
winter is fourteen hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.39" id="Page_ii.39">ii. 39</a></span>dred,&quot; he writes, &quot;and I am not surprised by
any manifestation of disappointment or dissatisfaction. This only I
claim&#8212;that no interest, passion, prejudice or partiality of my own
has controlled any decision I have made.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>But there was one wheel lacking in the Weed machine. The Democrats
controlled the Senate, obstructing bills deemed by the Whigs essential
to the public welfare, and refusing to confirm Seward's nominations.
By preventing an agreement upon a candidate, preliminary to a joint
ballot, they also blocked the election of a United States senator.
This situation was intolerable to Weed. Without the Senate, little
could be accomplished and nothing of a strictly partisan character.
Besides, Weed had his eye on the lucrative place of state printer. In
the campaign of 1839, therefore, he set to work to win the higher body
of the Legislature by carrying the Albany district, in which three
senators were to be chosen. For eighteen years, the Senate had been
held by the Regency party, and, in all that time, Albany was numbered
among the reliable Democratic districts. But Weed's friends now
brought up eight thousand dollars from New York. The Democrats had
made a spirited fight, and, although they knew Weed was endowed with a
faculty for management, they did not know of his money, or of the
ability of his lieutenants to place it. When the votes were counted,
Weed's three nominees had an average majority of one hundred and
thirty-three. This gave the Whigs nineteen senators and the Democrats
thirteen. It was an appalling change for the Democrats, to whom it
seemed the prologue to a defeat in 1840. In the &quot;clean sweep&quot; of
office-holders that followed, Tallmadge went back to the United States
Senate, and Weed took from Croswell the office of public printer.</p>

<p>The presidential election of 1840 began in December, 1839. During
Clay's visit to Saratoga, in the preceding summer, Weed had told him
he could not carry New York; but, that Clay's friends in New York
City, and along the river counties, might not be unduly alarmed, Weed
masked his purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.40" id="Page_ii.40">ii. 40</a></span> of forcing Harrison's nomination, by selecting
delegates ostensibly favourable to General Scott. Twenty delegates for
Scott were, therefore, sent to the national convention at Harrisburg,
two for Harrison and ten for Clay. On his way, Weed secured an
agreement from the New England leaders to act with him, and, by a
combination of the supporters of Scott and Harrison, the latter
finally received one hundred and forty-eight votes to ninety for Clay.
The disappointment of Clay's friends is historic. Probably nothing
parallels it in American politics. The defeat of Seward at Chicago in
1860, and of Elaine at Cincinnati in 1876, very seriously affected
their friends, but the disappointment of Clay's supporters at
Harrisburg, in December, 1839, took the form of anger, which, for a
time, seemed fatal to the ticket. &quot;The nomination of Harrison,&quot; wrote
Thurlow Weed, &quot;so offended the friends of Clay that the convention was
thrown entirely in the dark on the question of Vice President. The
Kentucky delegation was asked to present a candidate, but they
declined. Then John Clayton of Delaware was fixed upon, but Reverdy
Johnson withdrew his name. Watkins Leigh of Virginia and Governor
Dudley of North Carolina were successively designated, but they
declined. While this was passing the Vice Presidency was repeatedly
offered to New York, but we had no candidate. Albert H. Tracy was
eminently qualified for usefulness in public life. He entertained a
high and strict sense of official responsibility, and had he not
previously left us he would have been nominated. John Tyler was
finally taken because we could get nobody else to accept.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Harrisburg convention, unlike its unselfish predecessors,
adjourned without a platform or declaration of principles; nor did the
candidates, in accepting their nominations, indulge in political
discussion. Votes were wanted from all who opposed Van Buren's
administration&#8212;from the strict constructionist friends of Tyler,
although opposed to the whole Whig theory of government, as much as
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.41" id="Page_ii.41">ii. 41</a></span> the followers of Harrison, who believed in protective tariffs
and internal improvements.</p>

<p>Such action contrasted strangely with the work of the national
Democratic convention which met at Baltimore on May 6, 1840. If
despondency filled the air, the delegates at least had the courage of
their convictions. After unanimously renominating Van Buren, it
declared for a limited federal power, for the separation of public
moneys from private banks, and for the constitutional inability of
Congress to interfere with slavery in the States, pronouncing the
efforts of Abolitionists both alarming and dangerous to the Union; it
opposed internal improvements by the general government; the fostering
of one industry to the injury of another; the raising of more money
than was needed for necessary expenses; and the rechartering of a
national bank. If this declaration did not shape the phrases, and
marshal the sentences of future platforms of the party, it embraced
the principles upon which Democracy went up to victory or down to
defeat during the next two decades; and it must have carried Van Buren
through successfully had not his administration fallen upon evil
times.</p>

<p>The President, with great moral courage and keen-sighted wisdom, met
the crisis of 1837 with an admirable bearing. The statesman suddenly
displaced the politician. In the three months intervening between the
suspension of specie payments and the extra session of Congress, Van
Buren prepared a message as clear and as unanswerable as the logic of
Hamilton's state papers. The law, he said, required the secretary of
the treasury to deposit public moneys only in banks paying their notes
in specie, and, since all banks had suspended specie payments, it was
necessary to provide some other custody. For this reason, he had
summoned Congress. Then he analysed the cause of the panic, arguing
that &quot;the government could not help people earn a living, but it could
refuse to aid the deception that paper is gold, and the delusion that
value can arise without labour.&quot; Those who look to the action of the
government, he declared, for specific aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.42" id="Page_ii.42">ii. 42</a></span> to the citizen to relieve
embarrassments arising from losses by reverses in commerce and credit,
lose sight of the ends for which government is created, and the powers
with which it is clothed. In conclusion, he recommended the enactment
of an independent treasury scheme, divorcing the bank and the state.</p>

<p>These words of wisdom, often repeated, long ago became the principle
of all administrations, notably of that of President Grant in the
great crisis of 1873; and, except from 1841 to 1846, the sub-treasury
scheme has been a cardinal feature of American finance. But its
enactment was a long, fierce battle. Beginning in 1837, the contest
continued through one Congress and half of another. Clay resisted and
Webster denounced the project, which did not become a law until July
4, 1840&#8212;too late to be of assistance to Van Buren in November.
Friends of the New Yorker loved to dwell upon his courage in thus
placing himself in the chasm between failing banks and a patriotic
people, often paralleling it with the historic leap of Marcus Curtius
into the Roman Forum to save the republic. &quot;But with this difference,&quot;
once exclaimed Andrew B. Dickinson, an unlearned but brilliant Steuben
County Whig, generally known as Bray Dickinson: &quot;the Roman feller
jumped into the gap of his own accord, but the people throw'd Van
Buren in!&quot;</p>

<p>On August 12, 1840, the Whigs renominated William H. Seward for
governor, and in the following month the Democrats named William C.
Bouck. There was a rugged honesty and ability about Bouck that
commended him to the people. He was not brilliant; he rarely attempted
to speak in public; and his education had been limited to a few months
of school in each winter; but he was a shrewd, wise Schoharie farmer,
well read in the ways of men and in the book of the world. Seward
thought him &quot;a kind, honest, amiable, and sagacious man, his easy and
fascinating manners lacking neither dignity nor grace.&quot; Beginning as
town clerk, Bouck had served acceptably as sheriff, assemblyman, and
for nineteen years as canal commissioner, personally superintending
the construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.43" id="Page_ii.43">ii. 43</a></span>tion of the canal from Brockport to Lake Erie, and
disbursing, without loss, eight millions of dollars. He had travelled
up and down the State until the people came to know him as &quot;the old
white horse,&quot; in allusion to a favourite animal which he rode for many
years; and to labourers and contractors his election became a matter
of the greatest personal interest.</p>

<p>But the hardships growing out of the panic of 1837 and the crisis of
1839 guided the actions of men. It made little difference to them that
Bouck had been a faithful, prudent, and zealous supporter of the
canals, or that, like DeWitt Clinton, he had been removed as canal
commissioner on purely political grounds. The issues were
national&#8212;not state. Van Buren clearly saw the force and direction of
public sentiment. Yet his sub-treasury measure, so beneficent in its
aims that its theory was not lost in the necessities growing out of
the Civil War, proved the strongest weapon in the armory of his
opponents. Webster, with mingled pathos and indignation, denounced his
&quot;disregard for the public distress&quot; by his &quot;exclusive concern for the
interest of government and revenue,&quot; declaring that help must come to
the people &quot;from the government of the United States&#8212;from thence
alone!&quot; This was the cry of the greenbacker in 1876 and the argument
of the free silver advocate in 1896. &quot;Upon this,&quot; said Webster, &quot;I
risk my political reputation, my honour, my all. He who expects to
live to see these twenty-six States resuming specie payments in
regular succession once more, may expect to see the restoration of the
Jews. Never. He will die without the sight.&quot; Yet Webster lived to see
the resumption of specie payments in a very short time, and he lived
long enough also to exclude this St. Louis speech from his collected
works. Nevertheless, Webster's eloquence contributed to Van Buren's
overwhelming defeat.</p>

<p>Much has been written of the historic campaign of 1840. The enthusiasm
has been called &quot;frenzy&quot; and &quot;crazy fanatacism.&quot; It has also been
likened to the crusading spirit, aroused by the preaching of Peter the
Hermit. &quot;The nation,&quot; said Clay, &quot;was like the ocean when convulsed by
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.44" id="Page_ii.44">ii. 44</a></span> terrible storm.&quot; Webster declared that &quot;every breeze says
change; the cry, the universal cry, is for a change.&quot; Long before
campaigns usually begin New York was a blaze of excitement. Halls were
insufficient to hold the crowds. Where hundreds had formerly
assembled, thousands now appeared. The long lines of wagons, driven to
the meeting places, raised clouds of dust such as mark the moving of
armies. The Whig state convention at Utica became a mass-meeting of
twenty-five thousand people, who formed into one great parade. &quot;How
long is this procession?&quot; asked a bystander of one of the marshals.
&quot;Indeed, sir, I cannot tell,&quot; was the reply. &quot;The other end of it is
forming somewhere near Albany.&quot;</p>

<p>The canvass became one of song, of association, and of imagination,
which aroused thoughts that were intensely animating and absorbing.
The taunt of a Virginia newspaper that Harrison should remain in his
log cabin on the banks of the Ohio made the log cabin &quot;a symbol,&quot; as
Weed happily expressed it, &quot;of virtue that dwells in obscurity, of the
hopes of the humble, of the privations of the poor, of toil and
danger, of hospitality and charity and frugality.&quot; Log cabins sprang
up like gourds in a night. At the door, stood the cider barrel, and,
hanging by the window, the omnipresent coonskin swayed in the breeze.
They appeared on medals, in pictures, in fancy work, and in
processions. Horace Greeley, who had done so much in 1838 through the
columns of the <i>Jeffersonian</i>, now began the publication of the <i>Log
Cabin</i>, filling whole sides of it with songs elaborately set to music,
and making it so universally popular that the New York <i>Tribune</i>,
established in the following year, became its legitimate successor in
ability and in circulation.</p>

<p>In his biography of Henry Clay, Schurz says that in no presidential
canvass has there ever been &quot;less thought.&quot; It is likely if there had
been no log cabins, no cider, no coon-skins, and no songs, the result
would have been the same, for, in the presence of great financial
distress, the people seek relief very much as they empty a burning
building. But the reader of the <i>Log Cabin</i> will find thought enough.
Greeley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.45" id="Page_ii.45">ii. 45</a></span> editorials summed up the long line of mistakes leading to
the panic of 1837, and the people understood the situation. They were
simply unwilling longer to trust the party in power.</p>

<p>Evidence of this distrust astonished Democrats as much as it pleased
the Whigs. The September election in Maine, followed in October by the
result in Ohio and Indiana, both of which gave large Whig majorities,
anticipated Harrison's overwhelming election in November. In New York,
however, the returns were somewhat disappointing to the Whigs.
Harrison carried the State by thirteen thousand majority, receiving in
all 234 electoral votes to 60 for Van Buren; but Seward's majority of
ten thousand in 1838 now dropped to five thousand,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> while the Whig
majority in the Assembly was reduced to four.</p>

<p>Seward's weakness undoubtedly grew out of his message in the preceding
January. With the approval of Dr. Knott of Union College, and Dr.
Luckey, a distinguished Methodist divine, he recommended the
establishment of separate schools for the children of foreigners and
their instruction by teachers of the same faith and language. The
suggestion created an unexpected and bitter controversy. Influential
journals of both parties professed to see in it only a desire to win
Catholic favour, charging that Bishop Hughes of New York City had
inspired the recommendation. At that time, the Governor had neither
met nor been in communication, with the Catholic prelate; but, in the
excitement, truth could not outrun misstatement, nor could the
patriotism that made Seward solicitous to extend school advantages to
the children of foreign parents, who were growing up in ignorance, be
understood by zealous churchmen.</p>

<p>After his defeat, Van Buren retired to Lindenwald, in the vicinity of
Kinderhook, his native village, where he was to live twenty-one years,
dying at the age of eighty. Lindenwald was an old estate, whose acres
had been cultivated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.46" id="Page_ii.46">ii. 46</a></span> one hundred and sixty years. William P. Van
Ness, the distinguished jurist and orator, once owned it, and, thirty
years before the ex-President bought it, Irving had secluded himself
amidst its hills, while he mourned the death of his betrothed, and
finished the <i>Knickerbocker</i>. As the home of Van Buren, Lindenwald did
not, perhaps, become a Monticello or a Montpelier. Jefferson and
Madison, having served eight years, the allotted term of honour, had
formally retired, and upon them settled the halo of peace and triumph
that belongs to the sage; but life at Lindenwald, with its leisure,
its rural quiet, and its freedom from public care, satisfied Van
Buren's bucolic tastes, and no doubt greatly mitigated the anguish
arising from bitter defeat, the proscription of friends, and the loss
of party regard which he was destined to suffer during the next
decade.</p>

<br />
HUMILIATION OF THE WHIGS<br />
<br />
1841-1842</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Whig state convention, assembled at Syracuse on October 7, 1842,
looked like the ghost of its predecessor in 1840. The buoyancy which
then stamped victory on every face had given place to fear and
forebodings. Eighteen months had left nothing save melancholy
recollections. Even the log cabins, still in place, seemed to add to
Whig depression, being silent reminders of the days when melody and
oratory, prophetic of success, filled hearts which could no longer be
touched with hope and faith. This meant that the Whigs, in the
election of 1841, had suffered a decisive defeat, losing the Assembly,
the Senate, and most of the congressmen. Even Francis Granger, whose
majority usually ran into the thousands, was barely elected by five
hundred. Orleans County, at one time the centre of the anti-masonic
crusade, sent Sanford E. Church to Albany, the first Democrat to break
into the Assembly from the &quot;infected district&quot; since the abduction of
William Morgan.</p>

<p>Several reasons accounted for this change. Harrison's death, within a
month after his inauguration, made John Tyler President, and Tyler
first refused appointments to Whigs, and then vetoed the bill, passed
by a Whig Congress, re-establishing the United States Bank. He said
that he had been opposed, for twenty-five years, to the exercise of
such a power, if any such power existed under the Constitution. This
completed the break with the party that elected him. Henry Clay
denounced his action, the Cabinet, except Webster, resigned in a body,
and the Whigs with great unanimity indorsed the Kentucky statesman for
President in 1844.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.48" id="Page_ii.48">ii. 48</a></span> To add to the complications in New York, John C.
Spencer, who now became secretary of war, so zealously espoused and
warmly defended the President that feelings of mutual distrust and
ill-will soon grew up between him and Weed. It is doubtful if any New
York Whig, at a time of such humiliation, could have accepted place in
Tyler's Cabinet and remained on terms of political intimacy with Weed;
but, of all men, John C. Spencer was the least likely to do so. In
Freeman's celebrated cartoon, &quot;The Whig Drill,&quot; Spencer is the only
man in the squad out of step with Thurlow Weed, the drum-major.</p>

<p>Governor Seward also played a part in the story of his party's
downfall. The school question, growing out of his recommendation that
separate schools for the children of Roman Catholics should share in
the public moneys appropriated by the State for school purposes, lost
none of its bitterness; the McLeod controversy put him at odds with
the national Administration; and the Virginia controversy involved him
in a correspondence that made him odious in the South. In his
treatment of the McLeod matter, Seward was clearly right. Three years
after the destruction of the <i>Caroline</i>, which occurred during the
Canadian rebellion, Alexander McLeod, while upon a visit in the State,
boasted that he was a member of the attacking party and had killed the
only man shot in the encounter. This led to his arrest on a charge of
murder and arson. The British Minister based his demand for McLeod's
release on the ground that the destruction of the <i>Caroline</i> &quot;was a
public act of persons in Her Majesty's service, obeying the orders of
their superior authorities.&quot; In approving the demand, Lord Palmerston
suggested that McLeod's execution &quot;would produce war, war immediate
and frightful in its character, because it would be a war of
retaliation and vengeance.&quot; Webster, then secretary of state, urged
Seward to discontinue the prosecution and discharge McLeod; but the
Governor, promising a pardon if McLeod was convicted, insisted that he
had no power to interfere with the case until after trial, while the
courts, upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.49" id="Page_ii.49">ii. 49</a></span> application for McLeod's discharge on habeas corpus,
held that as peace existed between Great Britain and the United States
at the time of the burning of the <i>Caroline</i>, and as McLeod held no
commission and acted without authority, England's assumption of
responsibility for his act after his arrest did not oust the court of
its jurisdiction. Fortunately, McLeod, proving his boast a lie by
showing that he took no part in the capture of the <i>Caroline</i>, put an
end to the controversy, but Seward's refusal to intervene broke
whatever relations had existed between himself and Webster.</p>

<p>The Virginia correspondence created even greater bitterness. The
Governor discovered that a requisition for the surrender of three
coloured men, charged with aiding the escape of a fugitive slave, was
based upon a defective affidavit; but, before he could act, the court
discharged the prisoners upon evidence that no offence had been
committed against the laws of Virginia. Here the matter might very
properly have ended; but, in advising Virginia's governor of their
discharge, Seward voluntarily and with questionable propriety,
enlarged upon an interpretation of the constitutional provision for
the surrender of fugitives from justice, contending that it applied to
acts made criminal by the laws of both States, and not to &quot;an act
inspired by the spirit of humanity and of the Christian religion,&quot;
which was not penal in New York. This was undoubtedly as good law as
it was poor politics, for it needlessly aroused the indignation of
Virginia, whose legislature retaliated by imposing special burdens
upon vessels trading between Virginia and New York until such time as
the latter should repeal the statute giving fugitive slaves the right
of trial by jury.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the Whig defeat, however, had its origin in
disasters incident to the construction of the canals. It had been the
policy of Governor Marcy, and other Democratic leaders, to confine the
annual canal expenditures to the surplus revenues, and, in enlarging
the Erie, it was determined to continue this policy. On the other
hand, the Whigs advocated a speedy completion of the public works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.50" id="Page_ii.50">ii. 50</a></span>
limiting the state debt to an amount upon which interest could be paid
out of the surplus revenues derived from the canal. This policy,
backed by several Democratic members of the Senate in 1838, resulted
in the authorisation of a loan of four millions for the Erie
enlargement. In 1839 Seward, still confident of the State's ability to
sustain the necessary debt, advised other improvements, including the
completion of the Genesee Valley and Black River canals, as well as
the construction of three railroads, at a total estimated expenditure
of twelve to fifteen millions. By 1841, the debt had increased to
eighteen millions, including the loan of four millions, while the work
was scarcely half finished. To add to the difficulty, state stocks
depreciated over twenty per cent., embarrassing the administration in
its efforts to raise money. The Democrats pronounced such a policy
disastrous and ruinous; and, although the Whigs replied that the
original estimates were wrong, that the price of labour and material
had advanced, and that when completed the canals would speedily pay
for themselves, the people thought it time to call a halt, and in the
election of 1841 they called it.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It was this overwhelming defeat that so depressed the Whigs, gathered
at the Syracuse convention, as they looked over the field for a
gubernatorial candidate to lead them, if possible, out of the
wilderness of humiliation. Seward had declined a renomination. He knew
that his course, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.51" id="Page_ii.51">ii. 51</a></span> in the Virginia controversy, had aroused
a feeling of hostility among certain Whigs who not only resented his
advancement over Granger and Fillmore, his seniors in years and in
length of public service, but who dreaded his lead as too bold, too
earnest, and too impulsive. The fact that the Abolitionists had
already invited him to accept their nomination for President in 1844
indicated the extent to which his Virginia correspondence had carried
him. So, he let his determination be known. &quot;My principles are too
liberal, too philanthropic, if it be not vain to say so, for my
party,&quot; he wrote Christopher Morgan, then a leading member of
Congress. &quot;The promulgation of them offends many; the operation of
them injures many; and their sincerity is questioned by about all.
Those principles, therefore, do not receive fair consideration and
candid judgment. There are some who know them to be right, and believe
them to be sincere. These would sustain me. Others whose prejudices
are aroused against them, or whose interests are in danger, would
combine against me. I must, therefore, divide my party in convention.
This would be unfortunate for them, and, of all others, the most false
position for me. And what have I to lose by withdrawing and leaving

<p>With Seward out of the way, Luther Bradish was the logical candidate
for governor. Fillmore had many friends present, and John A. Collier
of Binghamton, alternating between hope and fear, let his wishes be
known. But, as lieutenant-governor, Bradish had won popularity by
firmness, patience, and that tact which springs from right feeling,
rather than cold courtesy; and, in the end, the vote proved him the
favourite. For lieutenant-governor, the convention chose Gabriel
Furman, a Brooklyn lawyer of great natural ability, who had been a
judge of the municipal court and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.52" id="Page_ii.52">ii. 52</a></span> was just then closing a term in the
State Senate, but whose promising career was already marred by the
opium habit. He is best remembered as one of Brooklyn's most valued
local historians. The resolutions, adhering to the former Whig policy,
condemning Tyler's vetoes and indicating a preference for Clay, showed
that the party, although stripped of its enthusiastic hopes, had lost
none of its faith in its principles or confidence in its great
standard-bearer.</p>

<p>The Democrats had divided on canal improvements. Beginning in the
administration of Governor Throop, one faction, known as the
Conservatives, had voted with the Whigs in 1838, while the other,
called Radicals, opposed the construction of any works that would
increase the debt. This division reasserted itself in the Legislature
which convened in January, 1842. The Radicals elected all the state
officers. Azariah C. Flagg became comptroller, Samuel Young secretary
of state, and George P. Barker attorney-general. Six canal
commissioners, belonging to the same wing of the party, were also
selected. Behind them, as a leader of great force in the Assembly,
stood Michael Hoffman of Herkimer, ready to rain fierce blows upon the
policy of Seward and the Conservatives. Hoffman had served eight years
in Congress, and three years as a canal commissioner. He was now, at
fifty-four years of age, serving his first term in the Assembly,
bringing to the work a great reputation both for talents and
integrity, and as a powerful and effective debater.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Hoffman was
educated for a physician, but afterward turned to the law. &quot;Had he not
been drawn into public life,&quot; says Thurlow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.53" id="Page_ii.53">ii. 53</a></span> Weed, &quot;he would have been
as eminent a lawyer as he became a statesman.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The Albany Regency, as a harmonious, directing body, had, by this
time, practically gone out of existence. Talcott was dead, Marcy and
Silas Wright were in Washington, Benjamin F. Butler, having resigned
from the Cabinet as attorney-general, in 1838, had resumed the
practice of his profession in New York City, and Van Buren, waiting
for another term of the Presidency, rested at Lindenwald. The
remaining members of the original Regency, active as ever in political
affairs, were now destined to head the two factions&#8212;Edwin Croswell,
still editor of the Albany <i>Argus</i>, leading the Conservatives, with
Daniel S. Dickinson, William C. Bouck, Samuel Beardsley, Henry A.
Foster, and Horatio Seymour. Azariah C. Flagg, with Samuel Young,
George P. Barker, and Michael Hoffman, directed the Radicals. All were
able men. Bouck carried fewer guns than Young; Beardsley had weight
and character, without much aptitude; Foster overflowed with knowledge
and was really an able man, but his domineering nature and violent
temper reduced his influence. Seymour, now only thirty-two years old,
had not yet entered upon his illustrious and valuable public career;
nor had Daniel S. Dickinson, although of acknowledged ability,
exhibited those traits which were to distinguish him in party
quarrels. He did not belong in the class with Marcy and Wright, though
few New Yorkers showed more indomitable courage than Dickinson&#8212;a
characteristic that greatly strengthened his influence in the councils
of the leaders whose differences were already marked with asperity.</p>

<p>Success is wont to have magical effects in producing a wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.54" id="Page_ii.54">ii. 54</a></span> to put an
end to difference; and the legislative winter of 1843 became notable
for the apparent adjustment of Democratic divisions. The Radicals
proposed the passage of an act, known as the &quot;stop and tax law of
1842,&quot; suspending the completion of the public works, imposing a
direct tax, and pledging a portion of the canal revenues as a sinking
fund for the payment of the existing debt. It was a drastic measure,
and leading Conservatives, with much vigour, sought to obtain a
compromise permitting the gradual completion of the most advanced
works. Bouck favoured sending an agent to Holland to negotiate a loan
for this purpose, a suggestion pressed with some ardour until further
effort threatened to jeopardise his chance of a renomination for
governor; and when Bouck ceased his opposition other Conservatives
fell into line. The measure, thus unobstructed, finally became the
law, sending the Democrats into the gubernatorial campaign of 1842
with high hopes of success.</p>

<p>By accident or design, the Democratic state convention also met at
Syracuse on October 7. William C. Bouck and Daniel S. Dickinson had
been the candidates, in 1840, for governor and lieutenant-governor,
and they now demanded renomination. The Radicals wanted Samuel Young
or Michael Hoffman for governor; and, before the passage of the &quot;stop
and tax law,&quot; the contest bid fair to be a warm one. But, after making
an agreement to pledge the party to the work of the last Legislature,
the Radicals withdrew all opposition to Bouck and Dickinson. In their
resolutions, the Democrats applauded Tyler's vetoes; approved the
policy of his administration; denounced the re-establishment of a
national bank; opposed a protective tariff; and favoured the
sub-treasury, hard money, a strict construction of the Constitution,
and direct taxation for public works.</p>

<p>The campaign that followed stirred no enthusiasm on either side. The
Whigs felt the weight of the canal debt, which rested heavily upon the
people; and, although many enthusiastic young men, active in the
organisation of Clay clubs and in preparing the way for the Kentucky
statesman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.55" id="Page_ii.55">ii. 55</a></span> in 1844, held mass-meetings and read letters from their
great leader, New York again passed under the control of the Democrats
by a majority of nearly twenty-two thousand.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was not an
ordinary defeat; it was an avalanche. Only one Whig senator, thirty
Whig assemblymen, and nine or ten congressmen were saved in the wreck.
&quot;I fear the party must break up from its very foundations,&quot; Fillmore
wrote Weed. &quot;There is no cohesive principle&#8212;no common head.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Seward took no such pessimistic view. He had the promise of the future
in him, a capacity for action, a ready sympathy with men of all
classes, occupations, and interests, and he saw rays of light where
others looked only into darkness. &quot;It is not a bad thing to be left
out of Congress,&quot; he wrote Christopher Morgan, depressed by his
defeat. &quot;You will soon be wanted in the State, and that is a better
field.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Seward had the faculty of slow, reflective brooding, and
he often saw both deep and far. In the night of that blinding defeat
only such a nature could find comfort in the outlook.</p>

DEMOCRATS DIVIDE INTO FACTIONS<br />
<br />
1842-1844</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">From</span> the moment of William C. Bouck's inauguration as governor, in
January, 1843, Democratic harmony disappeared. It was supposed the
question of canal improvement had been settled by the &quot;stop and tax
law&quot; of 1842, and by the subsequent agreement of the Conservatives, at
the Syracuse convention, in the following October. No one believed
that any serious disposition existed on the part of the Governor to
open the wound, since he knew a large majority of his party opposed
the resumption of the work, and that the state officers, who had
viewed his nomination with coldness, were watching his acts and
critically weighing his words.</p>

<p>But he also knew that his most zealous and devoted friends, living
along the line of the Erie, Black River, and Genesee Valley canals,
earnestly desired the speedy completion of certain parts of these
waterways. In order to please them, his message suggested the
propriety of taking advantage of the low prices of labour and
provisions to finish some of the work. He did it timidly. There was no
positive recommendation. He touched the subject as one handles a live
electric wire, trembling lest he rouse the sleeping opposition of the
Radicals, or fail to meet the expectation of friends. But the
recommendation, too expressionless to cheer his friends and too
energetic to suit his opponents, foreshadowed the pitfalls into which
he was to tumble. He had been the first to suggest the Erie
enlargement, and he knew better than any other man in the State how
important was its completion; yet he said as little in its favour as
could be said, if he said anything at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.57" id="Page_ii.57">ii. 57</a></span> all, and that little seemed to
be prompted, not so much for the good of the State, as to satisfy the
demands of ardent friends, who had contributed to his nomination and
election.</p>

<p>Severe criticism of the message, by the radical press, quickly showed
that not even a temporary reconciliation had been effected by the act
of 1842. Had the Governor now been sufficiently endowed with a faculty
for good management, he must have strengthened himself and weakened
his enemies with the vast amount of patronage at his command. Not
since the days of Governor Lewis, had the making of so many
appointments been committed to an executive. The Whigs, under Seward,
had taken every office in the State. But Bouck, practising the
nepotism that characterised Lewis' administration forty years before,
took good care of his own family, and then, in the interest of
harmony, turned whatever was left over to the members of the
Legislature, who selected their own friends regardless of their
relations to the Governor. There is something grim and pathetic in the
picture of the rude awakening of this farmer governor, who, while
working in his own weak way for harmony and conciliation, discovered,
too late, that partisan rivalries and personal ambition had surrounded
him with a cordon of enemies that could not be broken. To add to his
humiliation, it frequently happened that the nominations of those whom
he greatly desired confirmed, were rejected in the Senate by the
united votes of Radicals and Whigs.</p>

<p>The controversy growing out of the election of a state printer to
succeed Thurlow Weed increased the bitterness between the factions.
Edwin Croswell had been removed from this office in 1840, and the
Conservatives now proposed to reinstate him. Croswell had carefully
avoided taking part in the factional contests then beginning to rend
the party. He had supported, apparently in good faith, the &quot;stop and
tax law&quot; of 1842, and, in the campaigns of 1841 and 1842, had been
associated with Azariah C. Flagg in the publication of the <i>Rough
Hewer</i>, a weekly paper of radical views, issued from the press of the
<i>Argus</i>; but his sympathies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.58" id="Page_ii.58">ii. 58</a></span> with the Conservatives, and when
they sought to re-elect him public printer, the Radicals, led by
Flagg, announced as their candidate Henry H. Van Dyck, the owner,
since 1840, of a one-third interest in the <i>Argus</i>. For seventeen
years, from 1823 to 1840, Croswell had held the office of state
printer, accumulating wealth and enjoying the regard of the party; and
Flagg and his colleagues contended that he should now give way to
another equally deserving. This was a strong reason in a party that
believed in rotation in office, especially when coupled with a desire
on the part of the Radicals to control the <i>Argus</i>; and, to avoid an
open rupture, Croswell proposed that a law be passed making the
<i>Argus</i> the state paper, without naming a public printer. Van Dyck
objected to this, as it would leave Croswell in control of the
establishment. Besides, Van Dyck claimed that, at the time he
purchased an interest in the <i>Argus</i>, Croswell promised to support him
for state printer. This Croswell denied.</p>

<p>Instantly, the air was alive with the thrill of battle. Croswell faced
difficulties such as no other office-seeker had thus far encountered,
difficulties of faction, difficulties of public sentiment, and
difficulties of personnel. Flagg's conceded fidelity and honesty as a
public officer, supplemented by his shrewdness and sagacity, made him
the unquestioned leader of the Radicals; and, in this initial and
crucial test of strength, he was indisposed to compromise or
conciliate; but in Edwin Croswell he met the most impressive figure
among the gladiators of the party. Croswell was the veteran editor
whose judgment had guided its tactics, and whose words were instinct
with life, with prophecy, and with fate. When he entered the
pilot-house of his party, men knew something was going to happen. A
perceptible hush seemed to announce his presence. At such times, his
caustic sentences, clear and compact, were rarely conciliatory; but
when he turned away from the wheel, achievement had proven his right
to leadership.</p>

<p>In his contest with Flagg, however, Croswell encountered angry
criticism from the Radicals and frigid approval from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.59" id="Page_ii.59">ii. 59</a></span> some
Conservatives. His candidacy plainly impaired the high respect which
his conduct and abilities had brought him. It was a mistake from every
point of view; but, once committed to such a course his Conservative
friends persevered, giving him finally sixty-six out of one hundred
and six votes cast. A speech made by Assemblyman Leland of Steuben
affords an interesting glimpse of the many influences summoned from
every quarter, until men found themselves in the centre of a political
cauldron from which there seemed no escape. &quot;All who have come up here
for office,&quot; said Leland, &quot;have been compelled to take one side or the
other, and as neither side knows what will be the result, some have
been disposed to cry 'good Lord, if a Lord, or good devil, if not a
Lord.'&quot; The newspapers added to the perils of the quarrel. In the
discussion preceding the election, the Albany <i>Atlas</i>, a daily paper
recently established, but until now without political prominence,
became the organ of the Radicals; and between it and the <i>Argus</i> a
fierce editorial battle, which extended to other Democratic papers
throughout the State, made the factional division broader and more
bitter.</p>

<p>Despite their quarrels, which continued throughout the legislative
session, the Democrats, in the state election of November, 1843,
carried two-thirds of the Assembly and five-sixths of the Senate.
Nevertheless, the strength of the Conservatives was greatly increased.
The utter and sudden abandonment of the canals, marked by a long line
of tools left where the workmen dropped them, had played an important
part in the campaign, and when the Democratic legislative caucus
convened, in January, 1844, the friends of canal improvement easily
defeated Michael Hoffman for speaker by a vote of fifty-six to
thirty-five, in favour of Elisha Litchfield of Onondaga. Henry A.
Foster, also an uncompromising champion of the Conservatives, was
elected president <i>pro tem.</i> of the Senate. Litchfield had been in
Congress. He was a strong man of acknowledged influence in the central
counties of the State. Besides, he had been a faithful fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.60" id="Page_ii.60">ii. 60</a></span>lower and
an ardent admirer of Croswell. There were those who thought Horatio
Seymour ought to be speaker; and, for a time, it looked as if he might
secure the office. He was the real leader of the Conservatives, and he
had more friends than Litchfield. But Litchfield had Croswell.</p>

<p>Backed by such a re-enforcement of Conservatives, Governor Bouck spoke
of canal improvement with less timidity. He admitted the necessity of
the tax law of 1842, but suggested the completion of &quot;such new works
as can be done with better economy than to sustain those designed to
be superseded&quot; and &quot;are exposed to great and permanent injury.&quot; There
was nothing forceful in this recommendation. He still kept the middle
of the road, but his request practically amounted to the completion of
some of the new work. It meant the finishing of the Schoharie
aqueduct, improving the Jordan level, enlarging the locks of the Erie
canal, and going on with the construction of the Black River and
Genesee Valley canals.</p>

<p>The Radicals, realising the seriousness of the situation, now rested
their hopes upon an elaborate report by Robert Dennison, chairman of
the Senate canal committee. It was a telling blow. It attacked the
estimated, as compared to the actual, cost of the canals, charging
engineers with culpable ignorance or corrupt intention. The Chenango
canal, it said, was estimated to cost $1,000,000; it actually cost
$2,417,000. The first estimate of the Black River canal called for an
expenditure of $437,000; after work was commenced, a recalculation
made it $2,431,000. It cost, finally, over $2,800,000. The Genesee
Valley canal presented even greater disparity, and more glaring
ignorance. The original estimate fixed the cost at $1,774,000.
Afterward, the same engineer computed it at $4,900,000; and it cost
over $5,500,000. The State would have made money, the report said, had
it built macadamised roads, instead of canals, at a cost of $4,000 a
mile, and paid teamsters two dollars a day for hauling all the produce
that the canals would transport when finished. In conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.61" id="Page_ii.61">ii. 61</a></span>
Dennison declared that work on the canals could not be resumed without
laying an additional direct tax. This statement touched the
pocket-books of the people; and, in the opinion of the Radicals,
closed the discussion, for no Democrat, confronting a presidential and
gubernatorial election, would dare burden his party with another
direct canal tax.</p>

<p>Horatio Seymour, chairman of the canal committee of the Assembly, now
appeared with a report, covering seventy-one octavo pages, which
illuminated the question even to the enlightenment of Michael Hoffman.
It was the first display of that mastery of legislative skill and
power, which Seymour's shrewd discerning mind was so well calculated
to acquire. The young Oneida statesman had been a favourite since his
advent in the Assembly in 1842. His handsome face, made more
attractive by large, luminous eyes, and a kind, social nature,
peculiarly fitted him for public life; and, back of his fascinating
manners, lay sound judgment and great familiarity with state affairs.
Like Seward, he possessed, in this respect, an advantage over older
members, and he was now to show something of the moral power which the
Auburn Senator displayed when he displeased the short-sighted
partisans who seemed to exist and to act only for the present.</p>

<p>In presenting his report Seymour was careful to sustain the pledges of
the act of 1842, and to condemn the pre-existing policy of creating
additional debts for the purpose of constructing new canals or
enlarging the Erie. With gentle and cunning skill he commended Azariah
C. Flagg's policy, adopted in 1835, of using only the surplus revenue
of the canals for such purposes. &quot;The errors we have committed,&quot; said
his report, &quot;are not without their utility or profitable teaching. The
corruptions of extravagance and the bitter consequences of
indebtedness, have produced their own correctives, and public opinion,
admonished by the past, has returned to its accustomed and healthful
channels, from which it will not be readily diverted. There is no
portion of our citizens who desire to increase our state indebtedness,
or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.62" id="Page_ii.62">ii. 62</a></span> do aught to the detriment of our common interests, when they
are shown the evils that inevitably follow in the train of borrowing
large sums of money, to be repaid, perhaps, in periods of pecuniary
distress and embarrassment. Neither is it true, on the other hand,
that any considerable number of our citizens are opposed to the
extension of our canals when it can be effected by the aid of surplus
revenues.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>This last sentence was the keynote. Bouck had suggested the principle,
and other Conservatives had vainly tried to enforce it, but it
remained for Seymour to obtain for it a fair and candid hearing. With
great clearness, he unfolded the condition of the public works and of
the public finances, and, with able reasoning, he showed that, out of
the canal revenues, all the pledges of the act of 1842 could be met,
and out of the surplus revenues, all the pledges of the act of 1836
could be completed. At the conclusion, he introduced a bill providing
for the resumption of work along the lines set forth in the report.</p>

<p>The reports of Dennison and Seymour reduced the issue to its lowest
terms. Dennison wanted the surplus revenues, if any, applied to the
payment of the state debt; Seymour insisted upon their use for the
enlargement of the Erie and the completion of the Black River and
Genesee Valley canals. Both favoured a sinking fund, with which to
extinguish the state debt, and both opposed the construction of any
new work which should add to that debt. But Dennison, with pessimistic
doggedness, denied that there would be sufficient surplus to produce
the desired result. Seymour, with much of the optimism of Seward,
cherished the hope that rich tolls, growing larger as navigation grew
better, would flow into the treasury, until all the canals would be
completed and all the debts wiped out. The Radical was more than a
pessimist&#8212;he was a strict constructionist of the act of 1842. He
held that the Seymour bill was a palpable departure from the policy of
that act, and that other measures, soon to follow, would eventually
overthrow such a policy. To all this Seymour re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.63" id="Page_ii.63">ii. 63</a></span>plied in his report,
that &quot;just views of political economy are not to be disseminated by
harsh denunciations, which create the suspicion that there is more of
hostility to the interests of those assailed than an honest desire to
protect the treasury of the State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Hoffman and Seymour set the tone to the debate in the Assembly. They
were, admittedly, the leaders of the two factions, and, although
Hoffman possessed remarkable powers of denunciation, which he used
freely against measures, his courtesy toward opponents was no less
marked than Seymour's.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Other Conservatives supported the measure
with ability. But it was Seymour's firmness of mind, suavity of
manner, unwearied patience, and incomparable temper, under a thousand
provocations, that made it possible to pass the bill, substantially as
he wrote it, by a vote of sixty-seven to thirty-eight. Even Michael
Hoffman refused to vote against it, although he did not vote for it.</p>

<p>The measure met fiercer opposition in the Senate. It had more acrid
and irritable members than the Assembly, and its talkers had sharper
tongues. In debate, Foster was the most formidable, but Albert
Lester's acerbity of temper fixed the tone of the discussion. Finally,
when the vote was taken the Democrats broke evenly for and against the
measure; but, as five Whigs supported it, the bill finally passed,
seventeen to thirteen.</p>

<p>It was a great victory for Seymour, then only thirty-four years old.
Indeed, the history of the session may be described as the passage of
a single measure by a single man whose success was based on supreme
faith in the Erie canal. Seymour flowingly portrayed its benefits,
and, with prophetic eye, saw the deeply ladened boats transporting the
produce of prosperous farmers who had chosen homes in the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.64" id="Page_ii.64">ii. 64</a></span> when
access was rendered so easy. What seemed to others to threaten
disaster to the State, appealed to him as a great highway of commerce
that would yield large revenues to the Commonwealth and abundantly
bless its people. He predicted the building of villages and the
development of diversified industries along its banks, and, in one of
his captivating sentences, he described the pleasure of travelling
quickly by packets, viewing the scenery of the Mohawk Valley by day
and sleeping comfortably in a cabin-berth at night. But he did not
favour building so rapidly as to burden the State with debt. This was
the mistake of the Seward administration, and the inevitable reaction
gave the Radicals an argument for delay, and Dennison an opportunity
for a telling report. Seymour put his faith in the earning capacity of
the Erie canal. Forty years later, when he advocated the abolition of
tolls, he found all his predictions more than verified.</p>

VAN BUREN DEFEATED AT BALTIMORE<br />
<br />
1844</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> canal contest and Horatio Seymour's success preceded many
surprises and disappointments which were to be disclosed in the
campaign of 1844. Never were the motions of the political pendulum
more agitated or more irregular. For three years, public sentiment had
designated Henry Clay and Martin Van Buren as the accepted candidates
of their respective parties for President; and, until the spring of
1844, the confidence of the friends of the Kentucky statesman did not
exceed the assurance of the followers of the ex-President. Indeed, the
Democratic party was known throughout the country as the &quot;Van Buren
party,&quot; and, although James Buchanan, John C. Calhoun, and Lewis Cass
had each been named as suitable persons for Chief Executive, the sage
of Lindenwald was the party's recognised leader and prospective
candidate. His sub-treasury scheme, accepted as wise and salutary, was
still the corner-stone of the party, buttressed by a tariff for
revenue and opposition to a national bank.</p>

<p>In national affairs, the Democratic party in New York was still a
unit. The Legislature of 1843 had re-elected Silas Wright to the
United States Senate, without a dissenting Democratic vote; and a
state convention, held at Syracuse in September of the same year, and
made up of Radicals and Conservatives, had instructed its delegation
to support New York's favourite son. But a troublesome problem
suddenly confronted Van Buren. President Tyler had secretly negotiated
a treaty of annexation with Texas, ostensibly because of the
contiguity and great value of its territory, in reality, because, as
Cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.66" id="Page_ii.66">ii. 66</a></span>houn, then secretary of state, showed in his correspondence with
Great Britain, Texas seemed indispensable to the preservation and
perpetuation of slavery. Texas had paved the way for such a treaty by
providing, in its constitution, for the establishment of slavery, and
by prohibiting the importation of slaves from any country other than
the United States. But for three months friends of the treaty in the
United States Senate had vainly endeavoured to find a two-thirds
majority in favour of its ratification. Then, the exponents of
slavery, having secretly brought to their support the enormous
prestige of Andrew Jackson, prepared to nominate a successor to
President Tyler who would favour the treaty.</p>

<p>Van Buren had never failed the South while in the United States
Senate. He had voted against sending abolition literature through the
mails into States that prohibited its circulation; he had approved the
rules of the Senate for tabling abolition petitions without reading
them; he had publicly deprecated the work of abolition leaders; and,
by his silence, had approved the mob spirit when his friends were
breaking up abolition meetings. But, in those days, American slavery
was simply seeking its constitutional right to exist unmolested where
it was; and, although the anti-slavery crusade from 1830 to 1840, had
profoundly stirred the American conscience, slavery had not yet, to
any extended degree, entered into partisan politics. The annexation of
Texas, however, was an aggressive measure, the first of the great
movements for the extension of slavery since the Missouri Compromise;
and it was important to the South to know in advance where the
ex-President stood. His administration had been adverse to annexation,
and rumour credited him with unabated hostility. To force him into the
open, therefore, William H. Hammit, a member of Congress from
Mississippi, addressed him a letter on the 27th of March, 1844. &quot;I am
an unpledged delegate to the Baltimore convention,&quot; wrote Hammit, &quot;and
it is believed that a full and frank declaration of your opinion as to
the constitutionality and expediency of immediately annexing Texas
will be of great service to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.67" id="Page_ii.67">ii. 67</a></span> cause, at a moment so critical of its
destiny.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Van Buren held this letter until the 20th of April,
thirty-seven days before the meeting of the convention. When he did
reply he recalled the fact that in 1837, after an exhaustive
consideration of the question, his administration had decided against
annexation, and that nothing had since occurred to change the
situation; but that if, after the subject had been fully discussed, a
Congress chosen with reference to the question showed that the popular
will favoured it, he would yield. It was a letter of great length,
elaborately discussing every point directly or indirectly relating to
the subject.</p>

<p>Van Buren deeply desired the nomination, and if the South supported
him he was practically certain of it. It was in view of the necessity
of such support that Van Buren's letter has been pronounced by a
recent biographer &quot;one of the finest and bravest pieces of political
courage, and deserves from Americans a long admiration.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Such
eulogy is worthily bestowed if Van Buren, at the time of the Hammit
letter, fully appreciated the gravity of the situation; but there is
no evidence that he understood the secret and hostile purpose which
led up to the Hammit inquiry, and the letter itself is evidence that
he sought to conciliate the Southern wing of his party. Charles Jared
Ingersoll of Pennsylvania, in his diary of May 6, 1844, declares that
nearly all of Van Buren's admirers and most of the Democratic press
were even then committed to annexation. Nevertheless, Van Buren and
his trusted advisers could not have known of the secret plotting of
Buchanan's and Cass's followers, or of the deception shrewdly
practised by Cave Johnson of Tennessee, ostensibly a confidential
friend, but really a leader in the plot to defeat Van Buren.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Besides, the sentiment of the country un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.68" id="Page_ii.68">ii. 68</a></span>mistakably recognised that
powerful and weighty as the inducements for annexation appeared, they
were light when opposed in the scale of reason to the treaty of amity
and commerce with Mexico, which must be scrupulously observed so long
as that country performed its duties and respected treaty rights. Even
after the nomination of a President only sixteen senators out of
fifty-one voted for annexation, proving that the belief still
obtained, in the minds of a very large and influential portion of the
party, that annexation was decidedly objectionable, since it must
lead, as Benton put it in his great speech delivered in May, 1844, to
an unjust, unconstitutional war with Mexico upon a weak and groundless
pretext. Thus, Van Buren had behind him, the weight of the argument, a
large majority of the Senate, including Silas Wright, his noble
friend, and a party sentiment that had not yet yielded to the crack of
the southern whip; and he was ignorant of the plan, already secretly
matured, to defeat him with the help of the followers of Buchanan and
Cass by insisting upon the two-thirds rule in the convention. Under
these circumstances, it did not require great courage to reaffirm his
previous views so forcibly and ably expressed. Cognisant, however, of
the growing desire in the South for annexation, he took good care to
remove the impression that he was a hard-shell, by promising to yield
his opinion to the judgment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.69" id="Page_ii.69">ii. 69</a></span> new Congress. This was a long step
in the direction of consent. It virtually said, &quot;If you elect a
Congress that will ratify the treaty and pay the price, I will not
stand in your way.&quot; In the presence of such complacency, the thought
naturally occurs that he might have gone a step farther and consented
to yield his opinions at once had he known or even suspected the
secret plans of his southern opponents, the bitterness of Calhoun and
Robert J. Walker, and their understanding with the friends of Buchanan
and Cass. Jackson's letter favourable to annexation, skilfully
procured for publication just before the convention, &quot;to blow Van out
of water,&quot; as his enemies expressed it, was, indeed, known to Van
Buren, but the latter believed its influence discounted by the great
confidence Jackson subsequently expressed in his wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Three days before the date of Van Buren's letter, Henry Clay, writing
upon the same subject, expressed the opinion that annexation at this
time, without the assent of Mexico, would be a measure &quot;compromising
the national character, involving us certainly in war with Mexico,
probably with other foreign powers, dangerous to the integrity of the
Union, inexpedient to the present financial condition of the country,
and not called for by any general expression of public opinion.&quot; Van
Buren had visited Clay at Ashland in 1842, and, after the publication
of their letters, it was suggested that a bargain had then been made
to remove the question of annexation from politics. However this may
be, the friends of the ex-President, after the publication of his
letter, understood, quickly and fully, the gravity of the situation.
Subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.70" id="Page_ii.70">ii. 70</a></span> activity was at its height all through the month of May.
Men wavered and changed, and changed again. So great was the alarm
that leading men of Ohio addressed their delegation in Congress,
insisting upon Van Buren's support. It was a moment of great peril.
The agitators themselves became frightened. A pronounced reaction in
favour of Van Buren threatened to defeat their plans, and the better
to conceal intrigue and tergiversation they deemed it wise to create
the belief that opposition had been wholly and finally abandoned. In
this they proved eminently successful. &quot;Many of the strongest
advocates of annexation,&quot; wrote a member of the New York delegation in
Congress, on May 18, nine days before the convention, &quot;have come to
regard the grounds taken by Van Buren as the only policy consistent
not only with the honour, but the true interests of the country. Such
is fast becoming and will soon be the opinion of the whole South.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But the cloud, at last, burst. No sooner had the Baltimore convention
convened than Benjamin F. Butler, the ardent friend and able spokesman
of Van Buren, discovered that the backers of Cass and Buchanan were
acting with the Southerners in the interest of a rule that required
two-thirds of all the delegates in the convention to nominate.
Instantly the air was thick with suggestion, devices, expedients. All
the arts of party emergency went on at an unprecedented rate. The
eloquent New Yorker, his clear, tenor voice trembling with emotion,
fought the battle on the highest moral grounds.</p>

<p>With inexhaustible tenacity, force, and resource, he laboured to hold
up to men's imagination and to burn into their understanding the shame
and dishonour of adopting a rule, not only unsound and false in
principle, but which, if adhered to, would coerce a majority to yield
to a minority. &quot;I submit,&quot; declared Butler, in closing, &quot;that to adopt
a rule which requires what we know cannot be done, unless the majority
yield to the minority, is to subject ourselves to the rule, not of
reason, but of despotism, and to defeat the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.71" id="Page_ii.71">ii. 71</a></span> purposes and objects
of this convention&#8212;the accomplishment of the people's will for the
promotion of the people's good.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The adoption of the rule, by a vote of 148 to 118, showed that the
Democratic party did not have a passionate devotion for Martin Van
Buren. Buchanan opposed his nomination; leading men in other States
did not desire him. The New England States, with Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan, Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, had
instructed for him; yet sixty-three of these instructed delegates
voted for the two-thirds rule, knowing that its adoption would defeat
him. The rule received thirty majority, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.72" id="Page_ii.72">ii. 72</a></span> Van Buren, on the first
ballot, received only thirteen. On the second ballot he dropped to
less than a majority; on the seventh he had only ninety-nine votes.
The excitement reached a climax when a motion to declare him the
nominee by a majority vote, was ruled out of order. In the
pandemonium, the New Yorkers, for the first time, seemed to unloose
themselves, letting fly bitter denunciations of the treachery of the
sixty-three delegates who were pledged to Van Buren's support. When
order was restored, a Virginian suddenly put forward the name of James
K. Polk as that of &quot;a pure, whole-hogged Democrat.&quot; Then the
convention adjourned until the next day.</p>

<p>Harmony usually follows a bitter convention quarrel. Men become
furiously and sincerely indignant; but the defeated ones must accept
the results, or, Samson-like, destroy themselves in the destruction of
their party. The next morning, Daniel S. Dickinson, the most violently
indignant the day before, declared that &quot;he loved this convention
because it had acted so like the masses.&quot; In a high state of nervous
excitement, Samuel Young had denounced &quot;the abominable Texas question&quot;
as the firebrand thrown among them, but his manner now showed that he,
also, had buried the hatchet. Even the serene, philosophic Butler,
who, in &quot;an ecstacy of painful excitement,&quot; had &quot;leaped from the floor
and stamped,&quot; to use the language of an eye-witness, now resumed his
wonted calmness, and on the ninth ballot, in the midst of tremendous
cheering, used the discretion vested in him to withdraw Van Buren's
name. In doing so, he took occasion to indicate his preference for
James K. Polk, his personal friend. Following this announcement,
Dickinson cast New York's thirty-five votes for the Tennesseean, who
immediately received the necessary two-thirds vote. The situation had
given Polk peculiar advantages. The partisans of Cass and Buchanan,
having willingly defeated Van Buren, made the friends of the New
Yorker thirsty to put their knives into these betrayers. This
situation, opening the door for a compromise, brought a &quot;dark horse&quot;
into the race for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.73" id="Page_ii.73">ii. 73</a></span> the first time in the history of national
conventions. Such conditions are common enough nowadays, but it may
well be doubted if modern political tactics ever brought to the
surface a more inferior candidate. &quot;Polk! Great God, what a
nomination!&quot; wrote Governor Letcher of Kentucky to Buchanan.</p>

<p>To make the compromise complete, the convention, by acclamation,
nominated Silas Wright for Vice President. But the man who had
recently declined a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United
States, and who, after the defeat of Van Buren, had refused the use of
his name for President, did not choose, he said, &quot;to ride behind the
black pony.&quot; A third ballot resulted in the selection of George M.
Dallas of Pennsylvania. Among the resolutions adopted, it was declared
that &quot;our title to the whole of Oregon is clear and unquestionable;
that no portion of the same ought to be ceded to England or any other
power; and the reoccupation of Oregon and the reannexation of Texas at
the earliest practicable period, are great American measures, which
the convention recommends to the cordial support of the Democracy of
the Union.&quot;</p>

<p>Van Buren's defeat practically closed his career. His failure of
re-election in 1840 had left his leadership unimpaired, but with the
loss of the nomination in 1844 went prestige and power which he was
never to regain. Seldom has it been the misfortune of a candidate for
President to experience so overwhelming an overthrow. Clay's failure
in 1839 and Seward's in 1860 were as complete; but they lacked the
humiliating features of the Baltimore rout. Harrison was an equal
favourite with Clay in 1839; and at Chicago, in 1860, Lincoln shared
with Seward the prominence of a leading candidate; but at Baltimore,
in 1844, no other name than Van Buren's appeared conspicuously above
the surface, until, with the help of delegates who had been instructed
for him, the two-thirds rule was adopted. It seemed to Van Buren the
result of political treachery; and it opened a chasm between him and
his former southern friends that was destined to survive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.74" id="Page_ii.74">ii. 74</a></span> during the
remaining eighteen years of his life. The proscription of his New York
friends undoubtedly aided this division, and the death of Jackson, in
1845, and rapidly accumulating political events which came to a climax
in 1848, completed the separation.</p>

<p>There are evidences that Van Buren's defeat did not break the heart of
his party in New York. Contemporary writers intimate that after his
election as President the warm, familiar manners changed to the
stiffer and more formal ways of polite etiquette, and that his visit
to New York, during his occupancy of the White House, left behind it
many wounds, the result of real or fancied slights and neglect. Van
Buren's rule had been long. His good pleasure sent men to Congress;
his good pleasure made them postmasters, legislators, and cabinet
officers. In all departments of the government, both state and
national, his influence had been enormous. For years his friends,
sharing the glory and profits of his continued triumphs, had been
filling other ambitious men with envy and jealousy, until his
overthrow seemed necessary to their success. Even Edwin Croswell
shared this feeling, and, although he did not boldly play a double
part, the astute editor was always seeking a position which promised
the highest advantage and the greatest security to himself and his
faction. This condition of mind made him quick to favour Polk and the
annexation of Texas, and to leave Van Buren to his now limited coterie
of followers.</p>

<p>Van Buren had much liking for the career of a public man. Very
probably he found his greatest happiness in the triumphs of such a
life; but we must believe he also found great contentment in his
retirement at Lindenwald. He did not possess the tastes and pleasures
of a man of letters, nor did he affect the &quot;classic retirement&quot; that
seemed to appeal so powerfully to men of the eighteenth century; but,
like John Jay, he loved the country, happy in his health, in his
rustic tastes, in his freedom from public cares, and in his tranquil
occupation. Skilled in horticulture, he took pleasure in planting
trees, and in cultivating, with his own hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.75" id="Page_ii.75">ii. 75</a></span> the fruits and flowers
of his table. There can be no doubt of his entire sincerity when he
assured an enthusiastic Pennsylvania admirer, who had pronounced for
him as a candidate in 1848, that whatever aspirations he may have had
in the past, he now had no desire to be President.</p>

SILAS WRIGHT AND MILLARD FILLMORE<br />
<br />
1844</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> New York delegation, returning from the Baltimore convention,
found the Democratic party rent in twain over the gubernatorial
situation. So long as Van Buren seemed likely to be the candidate for
President, opposition to Governor Bouck's renomination was smothered
by the desire of the Radicals to unite with the Conservatives, and
thus make sure of the State's electoral vote. This was the Van Buren
plan. After the latter's defeat, however, the Radicals demanded the
nomination of Silas Wright of Canton. Van Buren and Wright had taken
no part in the canal controversy; but they belonged to the Radicals,
and, with Wright, and with no one else, could the latter hope to
defeat the &quot;Agricultural Governor.&quot; Their importunity greatly
distressed the Canton statesman, who desired to remain in the United
States Senate, to which he had been recently re-elected for a third
term, and to whom, from every point of view, the governorship was
distasteful.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Besides taking him from the Senate, it meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.77" id="Page_ii.77">ii. 77</a></span>
contention with two bitterly jealous and hostile factions, one of
which would be displeased with impartiality, the other ready to plunge
the party into a fierce feud on the slightest show of partiality.
Therefore, he firmly declined to be a candidate.</p>

<p>But the Albany <i>Atlas</i>, representing the Radicals, insisted upon
Wright's making the sacrifice; and, to give Bouck an easy avenue of
escape, Edwin Croswell, representing the Conservatives, advised that
the Governor would withdraw if he should consent to stand. But he
again refused. Still the <i>Atlas</i> continued to insist. By the middle of
July things looked very black. In Albany, the atmosphere became thick
with political passion. Finally, Van Buren interfered. He was
profoundly affected with the idea that political treachery had
compassed his defeat, and he knew the nomination of Polk was
personally offensive to Silas Wright; but, faithful to his promise to
support the action of the Baltimore convention, he requested his
friend to lead the state ticket, since the result in New York would
probably decide, as it did decide, the fate of the Democratic party in
the nation. Still the Senator refused. His decision, more critical
than he seemed to be aware, compelled his Radical friends to invent
new compromises, until the refusal was modified into a conditional
consent. In other words, he would accept the nomination provided he
was not placed in the position of opposing &quot;any Republican who is, or
who may become a candidate.&quot;</p>

<p>This action of the Radicals kept the Conservatives busy bailing a
sinking boat. They believed the candidacy of Bouck would shut out
Wright under the terms of his letter, and, although the Governor's
supporters were daily detached by the action of county conventions,
and the Governor himself wished to withdraw to avoid the humiliation
of a defeat by ballot, the Conservatives continued their opposition.
For once it could be truthfully said of a candidate that he was &quot;in
the hands of his friends.&quot; Even the &quot;judicious&quot; delegate, whom the
Governor directed to withdraw his name, declined executing the
commission until a ballot had nomi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.78" id="Page_ii.78">ii. 78</a></span>nated Wright, giving him
ninety-five votes to thirty for Bouck. &quot;Wright's nomination is the
fatality,&quot; wrote Seward. &quot;Election or defeat exhausts him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Seward
had the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p>The bitterness of the contest was further revealed in the refusal of
Daniel S. Dickinson, a doughty Conservative, to accept a renomination
for lieutenant-governor, notwithstanding Silas Wright had especially
asked it. There were many surmises, everybody was excited, and the
door to harmony seemed closed forever; but it opened again when the
name of Addison Gardiner of Rochester came up. Gardiner had been
guided by high ideals. He was kind and tolerant; the voice of personal
anger was never heard from his lips; and Conservative and Radical held
him in high respect. At Manlius, in 1821, Gardiner had become the
closest friend of Thurlow Weed, an intimacy that was severed only by
death. He was a young lawyer then, anxious to seek his fortune in the
West, and on his way to Indianapolis happened to stop at Rochester.
The place proved too attractive to give up, and, through his
influence, Weed also made it his residence. &quot;How curious it seems,&quot; he
once wrote his distinguished journalistic friend, &quot;that circumstances
which we regard at the time as scarcely worthy of notice often change
the entire current of our lives.&quot; A few years later, through Weed's
influence, Gardiner became a judge of the Supreme Court, laying the
foundation for a public life of honourable and almost unceasing
activity.</p>

<p>Though the Whigs needed their ablest and most popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.79" id="Page_ii.79">ii. 79</a></span> men to meet
Wright and Gardiner, preceding events guided the action of their state
convention, which met at Syracuse, on the 11th of September, 1844.
Horace Greeley had picked out Millard Fillmore for the Vice Presidency
on the ticket with Henry Clay, and his New York friends, proud of his
work in Congress, as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means,
presented his name with the hope that other States, profiting by the
tariff which he had framed, might join them in recognising his
valuable public service. But the convention had not taken kindly to
him, probably for the same reason that Greeley desired his promotion;
for, upon the slavery question, Fillmore had been more pronounced and
aggressive than Seward, sympathising and acting in Congress with
Giddings of Ohio and John P. Hale of New Hampshire, a part very
difficult to perform in those days without losing caste as a Whig.</p>

<p>Fillmore's defeat on May 1, however, made him the candidate for
governor on September 11. Weed pronounced for him very early, and the
party leaders fell into line with a unanimity that must have been as
balm to Fillmore's sores. &quot;I wish to say to you,&quot; wrote George W.
Patterson to Weed, &quot;that you are right, as usual, on the question of
governor. After Frelinghuysen was named for Vice President, it struck
me that Fillmore above all others was the man. You may rest assured
that he will help Mr. Clay to a large number of good men's votes. Mr.
Clay's slaves and his old duel would have hurt him with some men who
will now vote the ticket. Fillmore is a favourite everywhere; and
among the Methodists where 'old Father Fillmore' is almost worshipped,
they will go him with a rush.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Yet the Buffalo statesman, not a
little disgruntled over his treatment at Baltimore, disclaimed any
desire for the nomination. To add to his chagrin, he was told that
Weed and Seward urged his selection for his destruction, and whether
he believed the tale or not, it increased his fear and apprehension.
But people did not take his assumed indifference seriously, and he was
unanimously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.80" id="Page_ii.80">ii. 80</a></span> nominated for governor, with Samuel J. Wilkin, of Orange,
for lieutenant-governor. Wilkin had been a leader of the Adams party
in the Assembly of 1824 and 1825. He was then a young lawyer of much
promise, able and clear-headed, and, although never a showy debater,
he possessed useful business talent, and an integrity that gave him
high place among the men who guided his party. &quot;I like Wilkin for
lieutenant-governor,&quot; wrote Seward, although he had been partial to
the selection of John A. King.</p>

<p>Without doubt, each party had put forward, for governor, its most
available man. Fillmore was well known and at the height of his
popularity. During the protracted and exciting tariff struggle of
1842, he had sustained himself as chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee with marked ability. It added to his popularity, too, that
he had seemed indifferent to the nomination. In some respects Fillmore
and Silas Wright were not unlike. They were distinguished for their
suavity of manners. Both were impressive and interesting characters,
wise in council, and able in debate, with a large knowledge of their
State and country; and, although belonging to opposite parties and in
different wings of the capitol at Washington, their service in
Congress had brought to the debates a genius which compelled
attention, and a purity of life that raised in the public estimation
the whole level of congressional proceedings. Neither was an orator;
they were clear, forcible, and logical; but their speeches were not
quoted as models of eloquence. In spite of an unpleasant voice and a
slow, measured utterance, there was a charm about Wright's speaking;
for, like Fillmore, he had earnestness and warmth. With all their
power, however, they lacked the enthusiasm and the boldness that
captivate the crowd and inspire majorities. Yet they had led
majorities. In no sphere of Wright's activities, was he more strenuous
than in the contest for the independent treasury plan which he
recommended to Van Buren, and which, largely through his efforts as
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was finally forced into law
on the 4th of July, 1840. Fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.81" id="Page_ii.81">ii. 81</a></span>more, in putting some of the hated
taxes of 1828 into the tariff act of 1842, was no less strenuous,
grappling facts with infinite labour, until, at last, he overcame a
current of public opinion that seemed far too powerful for resistance.</p>

<p>Of the two men, Silas Wright was undoubtedly the stronger character.
He was five years older than Fillmore, and his legislative experience
had been four or five years longer. His great intellectual power
peculiarly fitted him for the United States Senate. He had chosen
finance as his specialty, and in its discussion had made a mark. He
could give high and grave counsel in great emergencies. His
inexhaustible patience, his active attention and industry, his genius
in overcoming impediments of every kind, made him the peer of the
ablest senator. He was not without ambitions for himself; but they
were always subordinate in him to the love of party and friends. It
will never be known how far he influenced Van Buren's reply to Hammit.
He bitterly opposed the annexation of Texas, and his conferences with
the ex-President must have encouraged the latter's adherence to his
former position. Van Buren's defeat, however, in no wise changed
Wright's attitude toward him. It is doubtful if the latter could have
been nominated President at Baltimore had he allowed the use of his
name, but it was greatly to his credit, showing the sincerity of his
friendship for Van Buren, that he spurned the suggestion and promptly
declined a unanimous nomination for Vice President. Such action places
him in a very small group of American statesmen who have deliberately
turned their backs upon high office rather than be untrue to friends.</p>

<p>Silas Wright was strictly a party man. He came near subjecting every
measure and every movement in his career to the test of party loyalty.
He started out in that way, and he kept it up until the end. In 1823
he sincerely favoured the choice of presidential electors by the
people, but, for the party's sake, he aided in defeating the measure.
Two years later, he preferred that the State be unrepresented in the
United States Senate rather than permit the election of Am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.82" id="Page_ii.82">ii. 82</a></span>brose
Spencer, then the nominee of a Clintonian majority, and he used all
his skill to defeat a joint session of the two houses. For the sake of
party he now accepted the gubernatorial nomination. Desire to remain
in the Senate, opposition to the annexation of Texas, dislike of
participating in factional feuds, refusal to stand in the way of
Bouck's nomination, the dictates of his better judgment, all gave way
to party necessity. He anticipated defeat for a second term should he
now be elected to a first, but it had no influence. The party needed
him, and, whatever the result to himself, he met it without complaint.
This was the man upon whom the Democrats relied to carry New York and
to elect Polk.</p>

<p>There were other parties in the field. The Native Americans, organised
early in 1844, watched the situation with peculiar emotions. This
party had suddenly sprung up in opposition to the ease with which
foreigners secured suffrage and office; and, although it shrewdly
avoided nominations for governor and President, it demoralised both
parties by the strange and tortuous man&#339;uvres that had ended in the
election of a mayor of New York in the preceding spring. It operated,
for the most part, in that city, but its sympathisers covered the
whole State. Then, there was the anti-rent party, confined to Delaware
and three or four adjoining counties, where long leases and trifling
provisions of forfeiture had exasperated tenants into acts of
violence. Like the Native Americans, these Anti-Renters avoided state
and national nominations, and traded their votes to secure the
election of legislative nominees.</p>

<p>But the organisation which threatened calamity was the abolition or
liberty party. It had nominated James G. Birney of Michigan for
President and Alvan Stewart for governor, and, though no one expected
the election of either, the organisation was not unlikely to hold the
balance of power in the State. Stewart was a born Abolitionist and a
lawyer of decided ability. In the section of the State bounded by
Oneida and Otsego counties, where he shone conspicuously as a leader
for a quarter of a century, his forensic achieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.83" id="Page_ii.83">ii. 83</a></span>ments are still
remembered. Stanton says he had no superior in central New York. &quot;His
quaint humour was equal to his profound learning. He was skilled in a
peculiar and indescribable kind of argumentation, wit, and sarcasm,
that made him remarkably successful out of court as well as in court.
Before anti-slavery conventions in several States he argued grave and
intricate constitutional questions with consummate ability.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It was evident that the Anti-Renters and Native Americans would draw,
perhaps, equally from Whigs and Democrats; but the ranks of
Abolitionists could be recruited only from the anti-slavery Whigs.
Behind Stewart stood Gerrit Smith, William Jay, Beriah Green, and
other zealous, able, benevolent, pure-minded men&#8212;some of them
wealthy. Their shibboleth was hostility to a slave-holder, or one who
would vote for a slave-holder. This barred Henry Clay and his
electors.</p>

<p>At the outset the Whigs plainly had the advantage. Spring elections
had resulted auspiciously, and the popularity of Clay seemed
unfailing. He had avowed opposition to the annexation of Texas, and,
although his letter was not based upon hostility to slavery and the
slave trade, it was positive, highly patriotic, and in a measure
satisfactory to the anti-slavery Whigs. &quot;We are at the flood,&quot; Seward
wrote Weed; &quot;our opponents at the ebb.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The nomination of Wright
had greatly strengthened the Democratic ticket, but the nomination of
Polk, backed by the Texas resolution, weighted the party as with a
ball and chain. Edwin Croswell had characterised Van Buren's letter to
Hammit as &quot;a statesmanlike production,&quot; declaring that &quot;every American
reader, not entirely under the dominion of prejudice, will admit the
force of his conclusions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This was the view generally held by the
party throughout the State; yet, within a month, every American reader
who wished to remain loyal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.84" id="Page_ii.84">ii. 84</a></span> the Democratic party was compelled to
change his mind. In making this change, the &quot;slippery-elm editor,&quot; as
Croswell came to be known because of the nearness of his office to the
old elm tree corner in Albany, led the way and the party followed. It
was a rough road for many who knew they were consigning to one grave
all hope of ending the slavery agitation, while they were resurrecting
from another, bitter and dangerous controversies that had been laid to
rest by the Missouri Compromise. Yet only one poor little protest, and
that intended for private circulation, was heard in opposition, the
signers, among them William Cullen Bryant, declaring their intention
to vote for Polk, but to repudiate any candidate for Congress who
agreed with Polk. Bryant's purpose was palpable and undoubted; but it
soon afterward became part of his courage not to muffle plain truth
from any spurious notions of party loyalty, and part of his glory not
to fail to tell what people could not fail to see.</p>

<p>As the campaign advanced, the Whig side of it resembled the contest of
1840. The log cabin did not reappear, and the drum and cannon were
less noisy, but ash poles, cut from huge trees and spliced one to
another, carried high the banner of the statesman from Ashland.
Campaign songs, with choruses for &quot;Harry of the West,&quot; emulated those
of &quot;Old Tip,&quot; and parades by day and torch-light processions by night,
increased the enthusiasm. The Whigs, deeply and personally attached to
Henry Clay, made mass-meetings as common and nearly as large as those
held four years before. Seward speaks of fifteen thousand men gathered
at midday in Utica to hear Erastus Root, and of a thousand unable to
enter the hall at night while he addressed a thousand more within.
Fillmore expressed the fear that Whigs would mistake these great
meetings for the election, and omit the necessary arrangements to get
the vote out. &quot;I am tired of mass-meetings,&quot; wrote Seward. &quot;But they
will go on.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Seward and Weed were not happy during this campaign. The friends of
Clay, incensed at his defeat in 1840, had pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.85" id="Page_ii.85">ii. 85</a></span>nounced them the chief
conspirators. Murmurs had been muffled until after Tyler's betrayal of
the party and Seward's retirement, but when these sources of possible
favours ran dry, the voice of noisy detraction reached Albany and
Auburn. It was not an ordinary scold, confined to a few conservatives;
but the censure of strong language, filled with vindictiveness,
charged Weed with revolutionary theories, tending to unsettle the
rights of property, and Seward with abolition notions and a desire to
win the Irish Catholic vote for selfish purposes. In February, 1844,
it was not very politely hinted to Seward that he go abroad during the
campaign; and by June, Weed talked despondingly, proposing to leave
the <i>Journal</i>. Seward had the spirit of the Greeks. &quot;If you resign,&quot;
he said, &quot;there will be no hope left for ten thousand men who hold on
because of their confidence in you and me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In another month Weed
had become the proprietor as well as the editor of the <i>Evening
Journal</i>.</p>

<p>As the campaign grew older, however, Clay's friends gladly availed
themselves of Seward's influence with anti-slavery Whigs and
naturalised citizens. &quot;It is wonderful what an impulse the nomination
of Polk has given to the abolition sentiment,&quot; wrote Seward. &quot;It has
already expelled other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.86" id="Page_ii.86">ii. 86</a></span> issues from the public mind. Our Whig central
committee, who, a year ago, voted me out of the party for being an
Abolitionist, has made abolition the war-cry in their call for a
mass-meeting.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Even the sleuth-hounds of No-popery were glad to
invite Seward to address the naturalised voters, whose hostility to
the Whigs, in 1844, resembled their dislike of the Federalists in
1800. &quot;It is a sorry consolation for this ominous aspect of things,&quot;
he wrote Weed, &quot;that you and I are personally exempt from the
hostility of this class toward our political associates.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Yet no man toiled more sedulously in this campaign than Seward.
&quot;Harrison had his admirers, Clay his lovers,&quot; is the old way of
putting it. To elect him, Whigs were ready to make any sacrifice, to
endure any hardship, and to yield every prejudice. Fillmore was
ubiquitous, delivering tariff and anti-Texas speeches that filled all
mouths with praise and all hearts with principle, as Seward expressed
it. An evident desire existed on the part of many in both parties, to
avoid a discussion of the annexation of Texas, and its consequent
extension of slavery, lest too much or too little be said; but leaders
like Seward and Fillmore were too wise to believe that they could fool
the people by concealing the real issue. &quot;Texas and slavery are at war
with the interests, the principles, the sympathies of all,&quot; boldly
declared the unmuzzled Auburn statesman. &quot;The integrity of the Union
depends on the result. To increase the slave-holding power is to
subvert the Constitution; to give a fearful preponderance which may,
and probably will, be speedily followed by demands to which the
Democratic free-labour States cannot yield, and the denial of which
will be made the ground of secession, nullification and disunion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
This was another of Seward's famous prophecies. At the time it seemed
extravagant, even to the strongest anti-slavery Whigs, but the future
verified it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.87" id="Page_ii.87">ii. 87</a></span></p>
<p>The Whigs, however, did not, as in 1840, have a monopoly of the
enthusiasm. The public only half apprehended, or refused to apprehend
at all, the danger in the Texas scheme; and, after the first chill of
their immersion, the Democrats rallied with confidence to the support
of their ticket. Abundant evidence of their strength had manifested
itself at each state election since 1841, and, although no trailing
cloud of glory now testified to a thrifty and skilful management, as
in 1836, the two factions, in spite of recent efforts to baffle and
defeat each other, pulled themselves together with amazing quickness.
Indeed, if we may rely upon Whig letters of the time, the Democrats
exhibited the more zeal and spirit throughout the campaign. They had
their banners, their songs, and their processions. In place of ash,
they raised hickory poles, and instead of defending Polk, they
attacked Clay. Other candidates attracted little attention. Clay was
the commanding, central figure, and over him the battle raged. There
were two reasons for this. One was the fear of a silent free-soil
vote, which the Bryant circular had alarmed in his favour. The other
was a desire to strengthen the liberty party, and to weaken the Whigs
by holding up Clay as a slave-holder. The corner-stone of that party
was hostility to the slave-holder; and if a candidate, however much he
opposed slavery, owned a single slave, it excluded him from its
suffrage. This was the weak point in Clay's armour, and the one of
most peril to the Whigs. To meet it, the latter argued, with some show
of success, that the conflict is not with one slave-holder, or with
many, but with slavery; and since the admission of Texas meant the
extension of that institution, a vote for Clay, who once advocated
emancipation in Kentucky and is now strongly opposed to Texas, is a
vote in behalf of freedom.</p>

<p>In September, Whig enthusiasm underwent a marked decline. Clay's July
letter to his Alabama correspondent, as historic now as it was
superfluous and provoking then, had been published, in which he
expressed a wish to see Texas added to the Union &quot;upon just and fair
terms,&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.88" id="Page_ii.88">ii. 88</a></span> and hazarded the opinion that &quot;the subject of slavery ought
not to affect the question one way or the other.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This letter was
the prototype of the famous alliteration, &quot;Rum, Romanism, and
Rebellion,&quot; in the Blaine campaign of 1884. Immediately Clay's most
active anti-slavery supporters were in revolt. &quot;We had the
Abolitionists in a good way,&quot; wrote Washington Hunt from Lockport;
&quot;but Mr. Clay seems determined that they shall not be allowed to vote
for him. I believe his letter will lose us more than two hundred votes
in this county.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The effects of the dreadful blow are as briefly
summed up by Seward: &quot;I met <i>that letter</i> at Geneva, and thence here,
and now everybody droops, despairs. It jeopards, perhaps loses, the
State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> A few weeks later, in company with several friends,
Seward, as was his custom, made an estimate of majorities, going over
the work several times and taking accurate account of the drift of
public sentiment. An addition of the columns showed the Democrats
several thousands ahead. Singularly enough, Fillmore, whose accustomed
despondency exhibited itself even in 1840, now became confident of
success. This can be accounted for, perhaps, on the theory that to a
candidate the eve of an election is &quot;dim with the self-deceiving
twilight of sophistry.&quot; He believed in his own safety even if Clay
failed. Although the deep, burning issue of slavery had not yet roused
popular forces into dangerous excitement, Fillmore had followed the
lead of Giddings and Hale, sympathising deeply with the restless flame
that eventually guided the policy of the North with such admirable
effect. On the other hand, Wright approved his party's doctrine of
non-interference with slavery. He had uniformly voted to table
petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,
declaring that any interference with the system, in that district, or
in the territories, endangered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.89" id="Page_ii.89">ii. 89</a></span> the rights of their citizens, and
would be a violation of faith toward those who had settled and held
slaves there. He voted for the admission of Arkansas and Florida as
slave States; and his opposition to Texas was based wholly upon
reasons other than the extension of slavery. The Abolitionists
understood this, and Fillmore confidently relied upon their aid,
although they might vote for Birney instead of Clay.</p>

<p>That Seward rightly divined public sentiment was shown by the result.
Polk carried the State by a plurality of little more than five
thousand, and Wright by ten thousand, while Stewart polled over
fifteen thousand votes.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> These last figures told the story. Four
years before, Birney had received less than seven thousand votes in
the whole country; now, in New York, the Abolitionists, exceeding
their own anticipations, held the balance of power.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Had their
votes been cast for Clay and Fillmore both would have carried New
York, and Clay would have become the Chief Executive. &quot;Until Mr. Clay
wrote his letter to Alabama,&quot; said Thurlow Weed, dispassionately, two
years afterward, &quot;his election as President was certain.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Clay's defeat was received by his devoted followers as the knell of
their hopes. For years they had been engaged labourously in rolling
uphill the stone of Sisyphus, making active friendships and seeking a
fair trial. That opportunity had come at last. It had been an affair
of life or death; the contest was protracted, intense, dramatic; the
issue for a time had hung in poignant doubt; but the dismal result let
the stone roll down again to the bottom of the hill. No wonder stout
men cried, and that thousands declared the loss of all further
interest in politics. To add to their despair and resentment, the
party of Birney and Stewart exulted over its victory not less than the
party of Polk and Silas Wright.</p>

THE RISE OF JOHN YOUNG<br />
<br />
1845-1846</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Democrats were again successful in electing a governor
and President, their victory had not healed the disastrous schism that
divided the party. The rank and file throughout the State had not yet
recognised the division into Radicals and Conservatives; but the
members of the new Legislature foresaw, in the rivalries of leaders,
the approach of a marked crisis, the outcome of which they awaited
with an overshadowing sense of fear.</p>

<p>The strife of programmes began in the selection of a speaker. Horatio
Seymour was the logical candidate. Of the Democratic members of the
last Assembly, he was the only one returned. He had earned the
preferment by able service, and a disposition obtained generally among
members to give him the right of way; but the state officials had not
forgotten and could not forget that Seymour, whose supple and
trenchant blade had opened a way through the ranks of the Radicals for
the passage of the last canal appropriation, had further sinned by
marshalling Governor Bouck's forces at the Syracuse convention on
September 4, 1844; and to teach him discretion and less independence,
they promptly warned him of their opposition by supporting William C.
Crain of Herkimer, a fierce Radical of the Hoffman school and a man of
some ability. Though the ultimate decision favoured Seymour, Azariah
C. Flagg, the state comptroller, resolutely exhausted every device of
strategy and tactics to avert it. He summoned the canal board, who, in
turn, summoned to Albany their up-state employees, mindful of the
latter's influence with the unsophisticated legislators already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.91" id="Page_ii.91">ii. 91</a></span>
haunted by the fear of party disruption. To limit the issue, Governor
Wright was quoted as favourable to Crain, and, although it
subsequently became known that he had expressed no opinion save one of
entire indifference, this added to the zeal of the up-state Radicals,
who now showed compliance with every hint of their masters.</p>

<p>In the midst of all Horatio Seymour remained undaunted. No one had
better poise, or firmer patience, or possessed more adroit methods.
The personal attractions of the man, his dignity of manner, his
finished culture, and his ability to speak often in debate with
acceptance, had before attracted men to him; now he was to reveal the
new and greater power of leadership. Seymour's real strength as a
factor in state affairs seems to date from this contest. It is
doubtful if he would have undertaken it had he suspected the
fierceness of the opposition. He was not ambitious to be speaker. So
far as it affected him personally, he had every motive to induce him
to remain on the floor, where his eloquence and debating power had won
him such a place. But, once having announced his candidacy he pushed
on with energy, sometimes masking his movements, sometimes mining and
countermining; yet always conscious of the closeness of the race and
of the necessity of keeping his activity well spiced with good nature.
Back of him stood Edwin Croswell. The astute editor of the <i>Argus</i>
recognised in Horatio Seymour, so brilliant in battle, so strong in
council, the future hope of the Democratic party. It is likely, too,
that Croswell already foresaw that Van Buren's opposition to the
annexation of Texas, and the growing Free-soil sentiment, must
inevitably occasion new party alignments; and the veteran journalist,
who had now been a party leader for nearly a quarter of a century,
understood the necessity of having available and successful men ready
for emergencies. Under his management, therefore, and to offset the
influence of the canal board's employees, Conservative postmasters and
Conservative sheriffs came to Albany, challenging their Radical canal
opponents to a measurement of strength. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.92" id="Page_ii.92">ii. 92</a></span> finally, the caucus
acted, the result showed how closely divided were the factions. Of
seventy Democrats in the Assembly, sixty-five were present, and of
these thirty-five voted for Seymour.</p>

<p>The irritation and excitement of this contest were in a measure
allayed by an agreement to renominate Azariah C. Flagg for comptroller
of state. His ability and his service warranted it. He had performed
the multiplying duties of the office with fidelity; and, although
chief of the active Radicals, the recollection of his stalwart aid in
the great financial panic of 1837, and in the preparation and advocacy
of the act of 1842, gave him a support that no other candidate could
command. It was also in the minds of two or three members holding the
balance of power between the factions, to add to the harmony by
securing an even division of the other four state offices. In carrying
out their project, however, the gifted Croswell took good care that
Samuel Young, whose zeal and ability especially endeared him to the
Radicals, should be beaten for secretary of state by one vote, and
that Thomas Farrington, another favourite Radical, should fail of
re-election as treasurer of state. Since Young and Farrington were the
only state officers, besides Flagg, seeking re-election, it looked as
if their part in the speakership struggle had marked them for defeat,
a suspicion strengthened by the fact that two Radicals, who took no
part in that contest, were elected attorney-general and
surveyor-general.</p>

<p>Reproachful ironies and bitter animosity, boding ill for future
harmony, now followed the factions into a furious and protracted
caucus for the selection of United States senators in place of Silas
Wright and Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, the latter having resigned to
accept the governorship of Wisconsin.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The Conservatives supported
Daniel S. Dickinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.93" id="Page_ii.93">ii. 93</a></span> and Henry A. Foster; the Radicals John A. Dix and
Michael Hoffman. There was more, however, at stake than the selection
of two senators; for the President would probably choose a member of
his Cabinet from the stronger faction; and to have time to recruit
their strength, the programme of the Radicals included an adjournment
of the caucus after nominating candidates for the unexpired terms of
Wright and Tallmadge. This would possibly give them control of the
full six years' term to begin on the 4th of the following March. A
majority of the caucus, however, now completely under the influence of
Edwin Croswell and Horatio Seymour, concluded to do one thing at a
time, and on the first ballot Dix was nominated for Wright's place,
giving him a term of four years. The second ballot named Dickinson for
the remaining month of Tallmadge's term. Then came the climax&#8212;the
motion to adjourn. Instantly the air was thick with suggestions.
Coaxing and bullying held the boards. All sorts of proposals came and
vanished with the breath that floated them; and, though the hour
approached midnight, a Conservative majority insisted upon finishing
the business. The election of Dix for a term of four years, they said,
had given the Radicals fair representation. Still, the latter
clamoured for an adjournment. But the Conservatives, inexorable,
demanded a third ballot, and it gave Dickinson fifty-four out of
ninety-three members present. When the usual motion to make the
nomination unanimous was bitterly opposed, Horatio Seymour took the
floor, and with the moving charm and power of his voice, with temper
unbroken, he made a fervid appeal for harmony. But bitterness ruled
the midnight hour; unanimity still lacked thirty-nine votes. As the
Radicals passed out into the frosty air, breaking the stillness with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.94" id="Page_ii.94">ii. 94</a></span>
their expletives, the voice of the tempter suggested a union with the
Whigs for the election of Samuel Young. There was abundant precedent
to support the plan. Bailey had bolted Woodworth's nomination; German
had defeated Thompson; and, in 1820, Rufus King had triumphed over
Samuel Young. But these were the tactics of DeWitt Clinton. In 1845,
the men who aspired to office, the men with a past and the men who
looked for a future, had no words of approval for such methods; and
before the Whigs heard of the scheme, Samuel Young had stamped it to
death.</p>

<p>To add to the chagrin of the Radicals, President Polk now invited
William L. Marcy, a Conservative of great prestige, to become
secretary of war. The Radicals did not know, and perhaps could not
know the exact condition of things at the national capital; certainly
they did not know how many elements of that condition told against
them. President Polk, apparently with a desire of treating his New
York friends fairly, asked Van Buren to recommend a New Yorker for his
Cabinet; and, with the approval of Silas Wright, the former President
urged Benjamin F. Butler for secretary of state, or Azariah C. Flagg
for secretary of the treasury. Either of these men would have filled
the place designated with great ability. Polk was largely indebted to
Van Buren and his friends; Butler had given him the vote of New York,
and Wright, by consenting to stand for governor at the urgent
solicitation of Van Buren, had carried the State and thus made
Democratic success possible. But Polk, more interested in future
success than in the payment of past indebtedness, had an eye out for
1848. He wanted a man devoted solely to his interests and to the
annexation of Texas; and, although Butler was a personal friend and an
ornament to the American bar, he hesitated, despite the insistence of
Van Buren and Wright, to make a secretary of state out of the most
devoted of Van Buren's adherents, who, like the sage of Lindenwald
himself, bitterly opposed annexation.</p>

<p>In this emergency, the tactics of Edwin Croswell came to Polk's
relief. The former knew that Silas Wright could not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.95" id="Page_ii.95">ii. 95</a></span> if he would,
accept a place in the Cabinet, since he had repeatedly declared during
the campaign that, if elected, he would not abandon the governorship
to enter the Cabinet, as Van Buren did in 1829. Croswell knew, also,
that Butler, having left the Cabinet of two Presidents to re-enter his
profession, would not give it up for a secondary place among Polk's
advisers. At the editor's suggestion, therefore, the President
tendered Silas Wright the head of the treasury, and, upon his
declination, an offer of the secretaryship of war came to Butler. The
latter said he would have taken, although with reluctance, either the
state or treasury department; but the war portfolio carried him too
far from the line of his profession. Thus the veteran editor's scheme,
having worked itself out as anticipated, left the President at
liberty, without further consultation with Van Buren, to give William
L. Marcy<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> what Butler had refused. To the Radicals the result was
as startling as it was unwelcome. It left the Conservatives in
authority. Through Marcy they would command the federal patronage, and
through their majority in the Legislature they could block the wheels
of their opponents. It was at this time that the Conservatives,
&quot;hankering,&quot; it was said, after the offices to be given by an
Administration committed to the annexation of Texas, were first called
&quot;Hunkers.&quot;</p>

<p>John Young, a Whig member of the Assembly, no sooner scented the
increasingly bitter feeling between Hunker and Radical than he
prepared to take advantage of it. Young was a great surprise to the
older leaders. He had accomplished nothing in the past to entitle him
to distinction. In youth he accompanied his father, a Vermont
innkeeper, to Livingston County, where he received a common school
education and studied law, being admitted to the bar in 1829, at the
age of twenty-seven. Two years later he served a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.96" id="Page_ii.96">ii. 96</a></span> term in the
Assembly, and for ten years thereafter he had confined his attention
almost exclusively to his profession, becoming a strong jury lawyer.
In the meantime, he changed his politics from a firm supporter of
Andrew Jackson to a local anti-masonic leader, and finally to a
follower of Henry Clay. Then the Whigs sent him to Congress, and, in
the fall of 1843, elected him to the celebrated Assembly through which
Horatio Seymour forced the canal appropriation. But John Young seems
to have made little more of a reputation in this historic struggle
than he did as a colleague of Millard Fillmore in the Congress that
passed the tariff act of 1842. He did not remain silent, but neither
his words nor his acts conveyed any idea of the gifts which he was
destined to disclose in the various movements of a drama that was now,
day by day, through much confusion and bewilderment, approaching a
climax. From a politician of local reputation, he leaped to the
distinction of a state leader. If unnoticed before, he was now the
observed of all observers. This transition, which came almost in a
day, surprised the Democrats no less than it excited the Whigs; for
Young lifted a minority into a majority, and from a hopeless defeat
was destined to lead his party to glorious victory. &quot;With talents of a
high order,&quot; says Hammond, &quot;with industry, with patient perseverance,
and with a profound knowledge of men, he was one of the ablest party
leaders and most skilful managers in a popular body that ever entered
the Assembly chamber.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Hammond, writing while Young was governor,
did not express the view of Thurlow Weed, who was unwilling to accept
tact and cunning for great intellectual power. But there is no doubt
that Young suddenly showed uncommon parliamentary ability, not only as
a debater, owing to his good voice and earnest, persuasive manner, but
as a skilful strategist, who strengthened coolness, courtesy, and
caution with a readiness to take advantage of the supreme moment to
carry things his way. Within a month, he became an acknowledged master
of parliamentary law, easily bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.97" id="Page_ii.97">ii. 97</a></span>ing order out of confusion by a few
simple, clear, compact sentences. If his learning did not rank him
among the Sewards and the Seymours, he had no occasion to fear an
antagonist in the field on which he was now to win his leadership.</p>

<p>The subject under consideration was the calling of a constitutional
convention. The preceding Legislature, hoping to avoid a convention,
had proposed several amendments which the people approved in the
election of 1844; but the failure of the present Legislature to ratify
them by a two-thirds majority, made a convention inevitable, and the
question now turned upon the manner of its calling and the approval of
its work. The Hunkers, with the support of the Governor, desired first
to submit the matter to the people; and, if carried by a majority
vote, taking as a test the number of votes polled at the last
election, the amendments were to be acted upon separately. This was
the plan of Governor Clinton in 1821. On the other hand, the Whigs,
the Anti-Renters, and the Native Americans insisted that the
Legislature call a convention, and that its work be submitted, as a
whole, to the people, as in 1821. This the Hunkers resisted to the
bitter end. An obstacle suddenly appeared, also, in the conduct of
William C. Grain, who thought an early and unlimited convention
necessary. Michael Hoffman held the same view, believing it the only
method of getting the act of 1842 incorporated into the organic law of
the State. Upon the latter's advice, therefore, Crain introduced a
bill in the Assembly similar to the convention act of 1821. It was
charged, at the time, that Crain's action was due to resentment
because of his defeat for speaker, and that the Governor, in filling
the vacancy occasioned by the transfer of Samuel Nelson to the Supreme
Court of the United States, had added to his indignation by
overlooking the claims of Michael Hoffman. It is not improbable that
Crain, irritated by his defeat, did resent the action of the Governor,
although it was well known that Hoffman had not sought a place on the
Supreme bench. But, in preferring an unlimited constitutional
convention, Crain and Hoffman expressed the belief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.98" id="Page_ii.98">ii. 98</a></span> most
eminent lawyers of the Commonwealth, that the time had come for
radical changes in the Constitution, and that these could not be
obtained unless the work of a convention was submitted in its entirety
to the people and approved by a majority vote.</p>

<p>Crain's bill was quickly pigeon-holed by the select committee to which
it was referred, and John Young's work began when he determined to
have it reported. There had been little difficulty in marshalling a
third of the Assembly to defeat the constitutional amendments proposed
by the preceding Legislature, since Whigs, Anti-Renters, and Native
Americans numbered fifty-four of the one hundred and twenty-eight
members; but, to overcome a majority of seventeen, required Young's
patient attendance, day after day, watchful for an opportunity to make
a motion whenever the Hunkers, ignorant of his design, were reduced by
temporary absences to an equality with the minority. Finally, the
sought-for moment came, and, with Crain's help, Young carried a motion
instructing the committee to report the Crain bill without amendment,
and making it the special order for each day until disposed of. It was
a staggering blow. The air was thick with suggestions, contrivances,
expedients, and embryonic proposals. The Governor, finding Crain
inexorable, sent for Michael Hoffman; but the ablest Radical in the
State refused to intervene, knowing that if the programme proposed by
Wright was sustained, the Whigs would withdraw their support and leave
the Hunkers in control.</p>

<p>When the debate opened, interest centred in the course taken by the
Radicals, who accepted the principle of the bill, but who demurred
upon details and dreaded to divide their party. To this controlling
group, therefore, were arguments addressed and appeals made. Hammond
pronounced it &quot;one of the best, if not the best, specimens of
parliamentary discussion ever exhibited in the capital of the
State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Other writers have recorded similar opinions. It was
certainly a memorable debate, but it was made so by the serious
political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.99" id="Page_ii.99">ii. 99</a></span> situation, rather than by the importance of the subject.
Horatio Seymour led his party, and, though other Hunkers participated
with credit, upon the Speaker fell the brunt of the fight. He
dispensed with declamation, he avoided bitter words, he refused to
crack the party whip; but with a deep, onflowing volume of argument
and exhortation, his animated expressions, modulated and well
balanced, stirred the emotions and commanded the closest attention.
Seymour had an instinct &quot;for the hinge or turning point of a debate.&quot;
He had, also, a never failing sense of the propriety, dignity, and
moderation with which subjects should be handled, or &quot;the great
endearment of prudent and temperate speech&quot; as Jeremy Taylor calls it;
and, although he could face the fiercest opposition with the keenest
blade, his utterances rarely left a sting or subjected him to
criticism. This gift was one secret of his great popularity, and daily
rumours, predicted harmony before a vote could be reached. As the
stormy scenes which marked the progress of the bill continued,
however, the less gifted Hunkers did not hesitate to declare the party
dissolved unless the erring Radicals fell into line.</p>

<p>John Young, who knew the giant burden he had taken up, showed himself
acute, frank, patient, closely attentive, and possessed of remarkable
powers of speech. Every word surprised his followers; every stroke
strengthened his position. He did not speak often, but he always
answered Seymour, presenting a fine and sustained example of debate,
keeping within strict rules of combat, and preserving a rational and
argumentative tone, yet emphasising the differences between Hunker and
Radical. Young could not be called brilliant, nor did he have the
capacity or finish of Seymour as an orator; but he formed his own
opinions, usually with great sagacity, and acted with vigour and skill
amid the exasperation produced by the Radical secession. Seward wrote
that &quot;he has much practical good sense, and much caution.&quot; This was
evidenced by the fact that, although only four Radicals voted to
report Crain's bill, others gradually went over, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.100" id="Page_ii.100">ii. 100</a></span> finally, on
its passage, only Hunkers voted in the negative. It was a great
triumph for Young. He had beaten a group of clever managers: he had
weakened the Democratic party by widening the breach between its
factions; and he had turned the bill recommending a convention into a
Whig measure.</p>

<p>The bad news discouraged the senators who dreamed of an abiding union
between the two factions; and, although one or two Radicals in the
upper chamber favoured the submission of the amendments separately to
the people, the friends of the measure obtained two majority against
all attempts to modify it, and four majority on its passage. The
Governor's approval completed Young's triumph. He had not only
retained his place as an able minority leader against the relentless,
tireless assaults of a Seymour, a Croswell, and a Wright; but, in the
presence of such odds, he had gained the distinction of turning a
minority into a reliable majority in both houses, placing him at once
upon a higher pedestal than is often reached by men of far greater
genius and eloquence.</p>

<p>The determination of the Hunkers to pass a measure appropriating
$197,000 for canal improvement made the situation still more critical.
Although the bill devoted the money to completing such unfinished
portions of the Genesee Valley and Black River canals as the
commissioners approved, it was clearly in violation of the spirit of
the act of 1842 upon which Hunker and Radical had agreed to bury their
differences, and the latter resented its introduction as an
inexcusable affront; but John Young now led his Whig followers to the
camp of the Hunkers, and, in a few days, the measure lay upon the
Governor's table for his approval or veto.</p>

<p>Thus far, Governor Wright had been a disappointment to his party.
Complaints from Radicals were heard before his inauguration. They
resented his acceptance of a Hunker's hospitality, asserting that he
should have made his home at a public house where Hunker and Radical
alike could freely counsel with him; they complained of his
resignation as United States senator, insisting that he ought to have
held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.101" id="Page_ii.101">ii. 101</a></span> the office until his inauguration as governor and thus prevented
Bouck appointing a Hunker as his successor; they denounced his
indifference in the speakership contest; and they murmured at his
opposition to a constitutional convention. There was cause for some of
these lamentations. It was plain that the Governor was neither a
leader nor a conciliator. A little tact would have held the Radicals
in line against a constitutional convention and kept inviolate the act
of 1842, but he either did not possess or disclaimed the arts and
diplomacies of a political manager. He could grapple with principles
in the United States Senate and follow them to their logical end, but
he could not see into the realities of things as clearly as Seymour,
or estimate, with the same accuracy, the relative strength of
conflicting tendencies in the political world. Writers of that day
express amazement at the course of Silas Wright in vetoing the canal
appropriation, some of them regarding him as a sort of political
puzzle, others attributing his action to the advice of false friends;
but his adherence to principle more easily explains it. Seymour knew
that the &quot;up-state&quot; voters, who would probably hold the balance of
power in the next election, wanted the canal finished and would resent
its defeat. Wright, on the other hand, believed in a suspension of
public works until the debt of the State was brought within the safe
control of its revenues, and in the things he stood for, he was as
unyielding as flint.</p>

<p>When the Legislature adjourned Hunkers and Radicals were too wide
apart even to unite in the usual address to constituents; and in the
fall campaign of 1845, the party fell back upon the old issues of the
year before. To the astonishment of the Hunkers, however, the
legislative session opened in January, 1846, with two Radicals to one
Conservative. It looked to the uninitiated as if the policy of canal
improvement had fallen into disfavour; but Croswell, and other Hunkers
in the inner political circle, understood that a change, long foreseen
by them, was rapidly approaching. The people of New York felt profound
interest in the conflict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.102" id="Page_ii.102">ii. 102</a></span> between slavery and freedom, and the
fearless stand of Preston King of St. Lawrence in supporting the
Wilmot Proviso, excluding &quot;slavery and involuntary servitude&quot; from the
territory obtained from Mexico, had added fuel to the flame. King was
a Radical from principle and from prejudice. For four successive years
he had been in the Assembly, hostile to canals and opposed to all
improvements. In his bitterness he denounced the Whig party as the old
Federalist party under another name. He was now, at the age of forty,
serving his second term in Congress. But, obstinate and uncompromising
as was his Democracy, the aggressive spirit and encroaching designs of
slavery had so deeply disturbed him that he refused to go with his
party in its avowed purpose of extending slavery into free or newly
acquired territory.</p>

<p>To the Hunkers, this new departure seemed to offer an opportunity of
weakening the Radicals by forcing them into opposition to the Polk
administration; and a resolution, approving the course of the New York
congressmen who had supported the annexation of Texas, appeared in the
Senate soon after its organisation. Very naturally, politicians were
afraid of it; and the debate, which quickly degenerated into bitter
personalities, indicated that the Free-soil sentiment, soon to inspire
the new Republican party, had not only taken root among the Radicals,
but that rivalries between the two factions rested on differences of
principle far deeper than canal improvement. &quot;If you study the papers
at all,&quot; wrote William H. Seward, &quot;you will see that the Barnburners
of this State have carried the war into Africa, and the extraordinary
spectacle is exhibited of Democrats making up an issue of slavery at
Washington. The consequences of this movement cannot be fully
apprehended. It brings on the great question sooner and more directly
than we have even hoped. All questions of revenue, currency, and
economy sink before it. The hour for the discussion of emancipation is
nearer at hand, by many years, than has been supposed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<br />
THE FOURTH CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION<br />
<br />
1846</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> constitutional convention, called by the Legislature of 1845,
received popular sanction at the fall elections; and, in April, 1846,
one hundred and twenty-eight delegates were chosen. The convention
assembled on the first day of June, and terminated its labours on the
ninth day of October. It was an able body of men. It did not contain,
perhaps, so many distinguished citizens as its predecessor in 1821,
but, like the convention of a quarter of a century before, it included
many men who had acquired reputations for great ability at the bar and
in public affairs during the two decades immediately preceding it.
Among the more prominent were Michael Hoffman of Herkimer, famous for
his influence in the cause of canal economy; James Tallmadge of
Dutchess, whose inspiring eloquence had captivated conventions and
legislatures for thirty years; William C. Bouck of Schoharie, the
unconquered Hunker who had faced defeat as gracefully as he had
accepted gubernatorial honours; Samuel Nelson, recently appointed to
the United States Supreme Court after an experience of twenty-two
years upon the circuit and supreme bench of the State; Charles S.
Kirkland and Ezekiel Bacon of Oneida, the powerful leaders of a bar
famous in that day for its famous lawyers; Churchill C. Cambreling of
New York, a member of Congress for eighteen consecutive years, and,
more recently, minister to Russia; George W. Patterson of Livingston,
a constant, untiring and enthusiastic Whig champion, twice elected
speaker of the Assembly and soon to become lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>Of the younger delegates, three were just at the threshold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.104" id="Page_ii.104">ii. 104</a></span> of their
brilliant and distinguished careers. John K. Porter of Saratoga&#8212;then
only twenty-seven years old, afterward to become a member of the Court
of Appeals and the associate of William M. Evarts as counsel for Henry
Ward Beecher in the Tilton suit&#8212;discussed the judiciary in speeches
singularly adapted to reach the understanding of the delegates; Samuel
J. Tilden, who had served respectably but without distinction in the
Assembly of 1845 and 1846, evidenced his inflexible courage and high
intellectual qualities; and Charles O'Conor, already known to the
public, gave signal proof of the prodigious extent of those powers and
acquirements which finally entitled him to rank with the greatest
lawyers of any nation or any time.</p>

<p>Of the more distinguished members of the convention of 1821, James
Tallmadge alone sat in the convention of 1846. Daniel D. Tompkins,
Rufus King, William W. Van Ness, Jonas Platt, and Abraham Van Vechten
were dead; James Kent, now in his eighty-third year, was delivering
law lectures in New York City; Ambrose Spencer, having served as
chairman of the Whig national convention at Baltimore, in 1844, had
returned, at the age of eighty-one, to the quiet of his agricultural
pursuits in the vicinity of Lyons; Martin Van Buren, still rebellious
against his party, was watching from his retreat at Lindenwald the
strife over the Wilmot Proviso, embodying the opposition to the
extension of slavery into new territories; Erastus Root, at the age of
seventy-four, was dying in New York City; and Samuel Young, famous by
his knightly service in the cause of the Radicals, had just finished
in the Assembly, with the acerbity of temper that characterised his
greatest oratorical efforts during nearly half a century of public
life, an eloquent indictment of the Hunkers, whom he charged with
being the friends of monopoly, the advocates of profuse and
unnecessary expenditures of the public funds, and the cause of much
corrupt legislation.</p>

<p>But of all men in the State the absence of William H. Seward was the
most noticeable. For four years, as governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.105" id="Page_ii.105">ii. 105</a></span> he had stood for
internal improvements, for the reorganisation of the judiciary along
lines of progress, for diminishing official patronage, for modifying,
and ultimately doing away with, feudal tenures, and for free schools
and universal suffrage. His experience and ability would have been
most helpful in the formation of the new constitution; but he would
not become a delegate except from Auburn, and a majority of the people
of his own assembly district did not want him. &quot;The world are all mad
with me here,&quot; he wrote Weed, &quot;because I defended Wyatt too
faithfully. God help them to a better morality. The prejudices against
me grows by reason of the Van Nest murder!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Political friends
offered him a nomination and election from Chautauqua, but he
declined, urging as a further reason that the Whigs would be in the
minority, and his presence might stimulate fresh discords among them.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley had expected a nomination from Chautauqua. He had
relations who promised him support, and with their failure to elect
him began that yearning for office which was destined to doom him to
many bitter disappointments. Until now, he had kept his desires to
himself. He wanted to be postmaster of New York in 1841; and, when
Seward failed to anticipate his ambition, he recalled the scriptural
injunction, &quot;Ask, and it shall be given you.&quot; So, he conferred with
Weed about the constitutional convention. Washington County was
suggested, then Delaware, and later Albany; but, the nominees having
been selected, the project was abandoned, and Horace Greeley waited
until the convention of 1867. Weed expressed the belief that if
Greeley's wishes had been known two weeks earlier, his ambition might
have been gratified, although on only two occasions had non-resident
delegates ever been selected.</p>

<p>Popular sovereignty attained its highest phase under the Constitution
of 1846; and the convention must always be notable as the great
dividing line between a government by the people, and a government
delegated by the people to cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.106" id="Page_ii.106">ii. 106</a></span>tain officials&#8212;executive, legislative,
and judicial&#8212;who were invested with general and more or less
permanent powers. Under the Constitution of 1821, the power of
appointment was placed in the governor, the Senate, and the Assembly.
State officers were elected by the Legislature, judges nominated by
the governor and confirmed by the Senate, district attorneys appointed
by county courts, justices of the peace chosen by boards of
supervisors, and mayors of cities selected by the common council.
Later amendments made justices of the peace and mayors of cities
elective; but, with these exceptions, from 1821 to 1846 the
Constitution underwent no organic changes. Under the Constitution of
1846, however, all officers became elective; and, to bring them still
nearer the people, an elective judiciary was decentralised, terms of
senators were reduced from four to two years, and the selection of
legislators was confined to single districts. It was also provided
that amendments to the Constitution might be submitted to the people
at any time upon the approval of a bare legislative majority. Even the
office of governor, which had been jealously reserved to native
citizens, was thrown open to all comers, whether born in the United
States or elsewhere.</p>

<p>As if to accentuate the great change which public sentiment had
undergone in the preceding twenty years these provisions were
generally concurred in by large majorities and without political bias.
The proposition that a governor need not be either a freeholder or a
native citizen was sustained by a vote of sixty-one to forty-nine; the
proposal to overcome the governor's veto by a majority instead of a
two-thirds vote was carried by sixty-one to thirty-six; the term of
senators was reduced from four to two years by a vote of eighty to
twenty-three; and their selection confined to single districts by a
majority of seventy-nine to thirty-one. An equally large majority
favoured the provision that no member of the Legislature should
receive from the governor or Legislature any civil appointment within
the State, or to the United States Senate. Charles O'Conor antagonised
the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.107" id="Page_ii.107">ii. 107</a></span>hibition of an election to the United States Senate with much
learning and eloquence. He thought the power of the State to qualify
or restrict the choice of senators was inconsistent with the Federal
Constitution; but the great majority of the convention held otherwise.
Indeed, so popular did this section become that, in 1874, members of
the Legislature were prohibited from taking office under a city
government.</p>

<p>The period when property measured a man's capacity and influence also
seems to have passed away with the adoption of the Constitution of
1846. For the first time in the State's history, the great landholders
lost control, and provisions as to the land law became clear and
wholesome. Feudal tenures were abolished, lands declared allodial,
fines and quarter sales made void, and leases of agricultural lands
for longer than twelve years pronounced illegal. Although vested
rights could not be affected, the policy of the new constitutional
conditions, aided by the accessibility of better and cheaper lands
along lines of improved transportation, compelled landlords in the
older parts of the State to seek compromises and to offer greater
inducements. The only persons required to own property in order to
enjoy suffrage and the right to hold office were negroes, who
continued to rest under the ban until the adoption of the fifteenth
amendment to the Federal Constitution. The people of New York felt
profound interest in the great conflict between slavery and freedom,
but, for more than a quarter of a century after the Wilmot Proviso
became the shibboleth of the Barnburners, a majority of voters denied
the coloured man equality of suffrage. Among the thirty-two delegates
in the convention of 1846 who refused to allow the people to pass upon
the question of equality of suffrage, appear the names of Charles
O'Conor and Samuel J. Tilden.</p>

<p>The great purpose of the convention was the reform of the laws
relating to debt and to the creation of a new judicial establishment.
Michael Hoffman headed the committee charged with the solution of
financial problems. He saw the importance of devoting the resources of
the State to the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.108" id="Page_ii.108">ii. 108</a></span>duction of its debt. It was important to the
character of the people, he thought, that they should be restless and
impatient under the obligation of debt; and the strong ground taken by
him against an enlargement of the Erie and its lateral canals had
resulted in the passage of the famous act of 1842, the substance of
which he now desired incorporated into the Constitution. He would
neither tolerate compromises with debtors of the State, nor allow its
credit to be loaned. He favoured sinking funds, he advocated direct
taxation, he insisted upon the strictest observance of appropriation
laws, and he opposed the sale of the canals. In his speeches he
probably exaggerated the canal debt, just as he minimised the canal
income and brushed aside salt and auction duties as of little
importance; yet everybody recognised him as the schoolmaster of the
convention on financial subjects. His blackboard shone in the
sunlight. He was courteous, but without much deference. There was
neither yielding nor timidity. If his flint struck a spark by
collision with another, it made little difference to him. Yet years
afterward, Thurlow Weed, who backed Seward in his appeal for more
extensive internal improvements, admitted that to Hoffman's
enlightened statesmanship, New York was indebted for the financial
article in the Constitution of 1846, which had preserved the public
credit and the public faith through every financial crisis.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Hoffman placed the state debt, with interest which must be paid up to
the time of its extinguishment, at thirty-eight million dollars. Out
of the canal revenues he wanted $1,500,000 paid yearly upon the canal
debt; $672,000 set apart for the use of the State; and the balance
applied to the improvement of the Erie canal, whenever the surplus
amounted to $2,500,000. Further to conserve the interests of the
Commonwealth, he insisted that its credit should not be loaned; that
its borrowed money should not exceed one million dollars, except to
repel invasion or suppress insurrection; and that no debt should be
created without laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.109" id="Page_ii.109">ii. 109</a></span> a direct annual tax sufficient to pay
principal and interest in eighteen years. The result showed that, in
spite of vigorous opposition, he got all he demanded. Some of the
amounts were reduced; others slightly diverted; and the remaining
surplus of the canal revenues, instead of accumulating until it
aggregated $2,500,000, was applied each year to the enlargement of the
Erie canal and the completion of the Genesee Valley and Black River
canals; but his plan was practically adopted and time has amply
justified the wisdom of his limitations. In concluding his last
speech, the distinguished Radical declared &quot;that this legislation
would not only preserve the credit of New York by keeping its debts
paid, but it would cause every State in the Union, as soon as such
States were able to do so, to sponge out its debts by payment and thus
remove from representative government the reproaches cast upon us on
the other side of the water.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>But Hoffman, while exciting the admiration of all men for his
persistence, dexterity, and ability, did not lead the most important
contest. In 1846, the popular desire for radical changes in the
judiciary was not less peremptory than the expression in 1821. Up to
this time, the courts of the State, in part, antedated the War of
Independence. Now, in place of the ancient appointive system, the
people demanded an elective judiciary which should be responsible to
them and bring the courts to them. To make these changes, the
president of the convention appointed a committee of thirteen, headed
by Charles H. Ruggles of Dutchess, which embraced the lawyers of most
eminence among the delegates. After the chairman came Charles O'Conor
of New York, Charles P. Kirkland of Utica, Ambrose L. Jordan of
Columbia, Arphaxed Loomis of Herkimer, Alvah Worden of Saratoga,
George W. Patterson of Livingston, and several others of lesser note.
At the end of the committee appeared a merchant and a farmer, possibly
for the reason that condiments make a dish more savoury. Ruggles was a
simple-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.110" id="Page_ii.110">ii. 110</a></span>hearted and wise man. He had been on the Supreme bench for
fifteen years, becoming one of the distinguished jurists of the State.
In the fierce conflicts between Clintonians and Bucktails he acted
with the former, and then, in 1828, followed DeWitt Clinton to the
support of Andrew Jackson. But Ruggles never offended anybody. His
wise and moderate counsel had drawn the fire from many a wild and
dangerous scheme, but it left no scars. Prudence and modesty had
characterised his life, and his selection as chairman of the judiciary
committee disarmed envy and jealousy. He was understood to favour an
elective judiciary and moderation in all doubtful reforms. Arphaxed
Loomis possessed unusual abilities as a public speaker, and, during a
brief career in the Assembly, had become known as an advocate of legal
reform. He was afterward, in April, 1847, appointed a commissioner on
practice and pleadings for the purpose of providing a uniform course
of proceedings in all cases; and, to him, perhaps, more than to any
one else, is due the credit of establishing one form of action for the
protection of private rights and the redress of private wrongs. Worden
had been a merchant, who, losing his entire possessions by failure,
began the study of law at the age of thirty-four and quickly took a
prominent place among the lawyers of the State. Ambrose L. Jordan,
although somewhat younger than Benjamin F. Butler, Thomas Oakley,
Henry R. Storrs, and other former leaders of the bar, was their
successful opponent, and had gained the distinction of winning the
first breach of promise suit in which a woman figured as defendant.
Patterson had rare and exquisite gifts which made him many friends and
kept him for half a century prominent in political affairs. Though of
undoubted intellectual power, clear-sighted, and positive, he rarely
answered other men's arguments, and never with warmth or heat. But he
had, however, read and mastered the law, and his voice was helpful in
conferring upon the people a system which broke the yoke of the former
colonial subordination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.111" id="Page_ii.111">ii. 111</a></span></p>

<p>The majority report of the judiciary committee provided for a new
court of last resort, to be called the Court of Appeals, which was to
consist of eight members, four of whom were to be elected from the
State at large for a term of eight years, and four to be chosen from
the justices of the Supreme Court. A new Supreme Court of thirty-two
members, having general and original jurisdiction in law and equity,
was established in place of the old Supreme Court and Court of
Chancery, the State being divided into eight districts, in each of
which four judges were to be elected. In addition to these great
courts, inferior local tribunals of civil and criminal jurisdiction
were provided for cities. The report thus favoured three radical
changes. Judges became elective, courts of law and equity were united,
and county courts were abolished. The inclusion of senators in the old
Court of Errors&#8212;which existed from the foundation of the State&#8212;had
made the elective system somewhat familiar to the people, to whom it
had proved more satisfactory than the method of appointment; but the
union of courts of law and equity was an untried experiment in New
York. It had the sanction of other States, and, in part, of the
judicial system of the United States, where procedure at law and in
equity had become assimilated, if not entirely blended, thus
abolishing the inconvenience of so many tribunals and affording
greater facility for the trial of equity causes involving questions of
fact.</p>

<p>But delegates were slow to profit by the experience of other
Commonwealths. From the moment the report was submitted attacks upon
it became bitter and continuous. Charles O'Conor opposed the elective
system, the union of the two courts, and the abolition of the county
court. Charles P. Kirkland proposed that only three members of the
Court of Appeals be elected, the others to be appointed by the
governor, with the consent of the Senate. Alvah Worden wanted two
Courts of Appeals, one of law and one of chancery, neither of which
should be elective. Simmons desired a different organisation of the
Supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.112" id="Page_ii.112">ii. 112</a></span> Court, and Bascom objected to the insufficient number of
sessions of the court provided for the whole State. Others of the
minority submitted reports and opinions, until the subject seemed
hopelessly befogged and the work of the majority a failure. O'Conor
was especially impatient and restless in his opposition. In skill and
ability no one could vie with him in making the old ways seem better.
He was now forty-two years old. He had a powerful and vigorous frame,
and a powerful and vigorous understanding. It was the wonder of his
colleagues how, in addition to the faithful work performed in
committee, he could get time for the research that was needed to equip
him for the great speeches with which he adorned the debates. He never
held office, save, during a portion of President Pierce's
administration, that of United States attorney for the southern
district of New York; but his rapid, almost instinctive judgment, his
tact, his ability to crush sophistries with a single sentence, and his
vigorous rhetoric must have greatly distinguished his administration
of any office which he might have occupied. Yet the conservatism which
finally separated him from the cordial supporters of the government
during the Civil War usually kept him in the minority. His spirit was
not the spirit that governed; and, in spite of his brilliant and
determined opposition, the convention of 1846 accepted the elective
system, approved the union of equity and law courts, prohibited the
election of a member of the Legislature to the United States Senate,
and submitted to the decision of the people the right of coloured men
to equal suffrage. Only in the retention of the county court were
O'Conor's views sustained; and this came largely through the influence
of Arphaxed Loomis, the material part of whose amendment was
ultimately adopted. When, finally, the Constitution in its entirety
was submitted to the convention for its approval, O'Conor was one of
six to vote against it.</p>

<p>The Constitution of 1846 was the people's Constitution. It reserved to
them the right to act more frequently upon a large class of questions,
introducing the referendum which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.113" id="Page_ii.113">ii. 113</a></span> characterises popular government,
and making it a more perfect expression of the popular will. That the
people appreciated the greater power reserved to them was shown on the
third of November, by a vote of 221,528 to 92,436. With few
modifications, the Constitution of 1846 still remains in force,&#8212;ample
proof that wisdom, unalloyed with partisan politics or blind
conservatism, guided the convention which framed it.</p>

DEFEAT AND DEATH OF SILAS WRIGHT<br />
<br />
1846-1847</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Democratic campaign for governor in 1846 opened with extraordinary
interest. Before the Legislature adjourned, on May 13, the Hunkers
refused to attend a party caucus for the preparation of the usual
address. Subsequently, however, they issued one of their own, charging
the Radicals with hostility to the Polk administration and with
selfishness, born of a desire to control every office within the gift
of the canal board. The address did not, in terms, name Silas Wright,
but the Governor was not blind to its attacks. &quot;They are not very
different from what I expected when I consented to take this office,&quot;
he wrote a friend in Canton. &quot;I do not yet think it positively certain
that we shall lose the convention, but that its action and the
election are to produce a perfect separation of a portion of our party
from the main body I cannot any longer entertain a single doubt. You
must not permit appearances to deceive you. Although I am not
denounced here by name with others, the disposition to do that, if
policy would permit, is not even disguised, and every man known to be
strongly my friend and firmly in my confidence is more bitterly
denounced than any other.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>It is doubtful if Silas Wright himself fully comprehended the real
reason for such bitterness. He was a natural gentleman, kindly and
true. He might sometimes err in judgment; but he was essentially a
statesman of large and comprehensive vision, incapable of any meanness
or conscious wrong-doing. The masses of the party regarded him as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.115" id="Page_ii.115">ii. 115</a></span>
representative of the opportunity which a great State, in a republic,
holds out to the children of its humblest and poorest citizens. He was
as free from guile as a little child. To him principle and party stood
before all other things; and he could not be untrue to one any more
than to the other. But the leaders of the Hunker wing did not take
kindly to him. They could not forget that the Radical state officers,
with whom he coincided in principle, in conjuring with his name in
1844 had defeated the renomination of Governor Bouck; and, though they
might admit that his nomination practically elected Polk, by
extracting the party from the mire of Texas annexation, they
preferred, deep in their hearts, a Whig governor to his continuance in
office, since his influence with the people for high ends was not in
accord with their purposes. For more than a decade these men, as
Samuel Young charged in his closing speech in the Assembly of that
year, had been after the flesh-pots. They favoured the banking
monopoly, preferring special charters that could be sold to free
franchises under a general law; they influenced the creation of state
stocks in which they profited; they owned lands which would appreciate
by the construction of canals and railroads. To all these selfish
interests, the Governor's restrictive policy was opposed; and while
they did not dare denounce him by name, as the Governor suggested in
his letter, their tactics increased the hostility that was eventually
to destroy him.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that the representation of Hunkers at
the Democratic state convention, held at Syracuse on October 1, did
not indicate much popular strength. The Radicals outnumbered them two
to one. On the first ballot Silas Wright received one hundred and
twelve votes out of one hundred and twenty-five, and, upon motion of
Horatio Seymour, the nomination became unanimous. For
lieutenant-governor, Addison Gardiner was renominated by acclamation.
The convention then closed its labours with the adoption of a platform
approving the re-enactment of the independent treasury law, the
passage of the Walker tariff act,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.116" id="Page_ii.116">ii. 116</a></span> and the work of the constitutional
convention, with an expression of hope that the Mexican War, which had
commenced on the 12th of the preceding May, might be speedily and
honourably terminated. The address concluded with a just eulogy of
Silas Wright. At the moment, the contest seemed at an end; but the
sequel showed it was only a surface settlement.</p>

<p>If Democrats were involved in a quarrel, the Whigs were scarcely a
happy family. It is not easy to pierce the fog which shrouds the
division of the party; but it is clear that when Seward became
governor and Weed dictator, trouble began in respect to men and to
measures. Though less marked, possibly, than the differences between
Democratic factions, the discord seemed to increase with the
hopelessness of Whig ascendancy. Undoubtedly it began with Seward's
recommendation of separate schools for the children of foreigners, and
in his pronounced anti-slavery views; but it had also festered and
expanded from disappointments, and from Weed's opposition to Henry
Clay in 1836 and 1840. Even Horace Greeley, already consumed with a
desire for public preferment, began to chafe under the domineering
influence of Weed and the supposed neglect of Seward; while Millard
Fillmore, and those acting with him, although retaining personal
relations with Weed, were ready to break away at the first
opportunity. As the Whigs had been in the minority for several years,
the seriousness of these differences did not become public knowledge;
but the newspapers divided the party into Radicals and Conservatives,
the former being represented by the <i>Evening Journal</i> and the
<i>Tribune</i>, the latter by the New York <i>Courier and Enquirer</i> and the
Buffalo <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>This division, naturally, led to some difference of opinion about a
candidate for governor; and, when the Whig state convention met at
Utica on September 23, an informal ballot developed fifty-five votes
for Millard Fillmore, thirty-six for John Young, and twenty-one for
Ira Harris, with eight or ten scattering. Fillmore had not sought the
nomination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.117" id="Page_ii.117">ii. 117</a></span> Indeed, there is evidence that he protested against the
presentation of his name; but his vote represented the conservative
Whigs who did not take kindly either to Young or to Harris. Ira
Harris, who was destined to bear a great part in a great history, had
just entered his forty-fourth year. He was graduated from Union
College with the highest honours, studied law with Ambrose Spencer,
and slowly pushed himself into the front rank of practitioners at the
Albany bar. In 1844, while absent in the West, the Anti-Renters
nominated him, without his knowledge, for the Assembly, and, with the
help of the Whigs, elected him. He had in no wise identified himself
with active politics or with anti-rent associations; but the people
honoured him for his integrity as well as for his fearless support of
the principle of individual rights. In the Assembly he demonstrated
the wisdom of their choice, evidencing distinguished ability and
political tact. In 1845 the same people returned him to the Assembly.
Then, in the following year, they sent him to the constitutional
convention; and, some months later, to the State Senate. Beneath his
plain courtesy was great firmness. He could not be otherwise than the
constant friend of everything which made for the emancipation and
elevation of the individual. His advocacy of an elective judiciary,
the union of law and equity, and the simplification of pleadings and
practice in the courts, showed that there were few stronger or clearer
intellects in the constitutional convention. With good reason,
therefore, the constituency that sent him there favoured him for
governor.</p>

<p>But John Young shone as the popular man of the hour. Young was a
middle-of-the-road Whig, whose candidacy grew out of his recent
legislative record. He had forced the passage of the bill calling a
constitutional convention, and had secured the canal appropriation
which the Governor deemed it wise to veto. In the Assembly of 1845 and
1846, he became his party's choice for speaker; and, though not a man
of refinement or scholarly attainments, or one, perhaps, whose wisdom
and prudence could safely be relied upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.118" id="Page_ii.118">ii. 118</a></span> under the stress of great
responsibilities, he was just then the chief figure of the State and
of great influence with the people&#8212;especially with the Anti-Renters
and their sympathisers, whose strife and turbulence in Columbia and
Delaware counties had been summarily suppressed by Governor Wright.
The older leaders of his party thought him somewhat of a demagogue;
Thurlow Weed left the convention in disgust when he discovered that a
pre-arranged transfer of the Harris votes would nominate him. But,
with the avowed friendship of Ira Harris, Young was stronger at this
time than Weed, and on the third ballot he received seventy-six votes
to forty-five for Fillmore. To balance the ticket, Hamilton Fish
became the candidate for lieutenant-governor. Fish represented the
eastern end of the State, the conservative wing of the party, and New
York City, where he was deservedly popular.</p>

<p>There were other parties in the field. The Abolitionists made
nominations, and the Native Americans put up Ogden Edwards, a Whig of
some prominence, who had served in the Assembly, in the constitutional
convention of 1821, and upon the Supreme bench. But it was the action
of the Anti-Renters, or national reformers as they were called, that
most seriously embarrassed the Whigs and the Democrats. The
Anti-Renters could scarcely be called a party, although they had grown
into a political organisation which held the balance of power in
several counties. Unlike the Abolitionists, however, they wanted
immediate results rather than sacrifices for principle, and their
support was deemed important if not absolutely conclusive. When the
little convention of less than thirty delegates met at Albany in
October, therefore, their ears listened for bids. They sought a pardon
for the men convicted in 1845 for murderous outrages perpetrated in
Delaware and Schoharie; and, although unsupported by proof, it was
afterward charged and never denied, that, either at the time of their
convention or subsequently before the election, Ira Harris produced a
letter from John Young in which the latter promised executive clemency
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.119" id="Page_ii.119">ii. 119</a></span> the event of his election. However this may be, it is not unlikely
that Harris' relations with the Anti-Renters aided materially in
securing Young's indorsement, and it is a matter of record that soon
after Young's inauguration the murderers were pardoned, the Governor
justifying his action upon the ground that their offences were
political. The democratic Anti-Renters urged Silas Wright to give some
assurances that he, too, would issue a pardon; but the Cato of his
party, who never caressed or cajoled his political antagonists,
declined to give any intimation upon the subject. Thereupon, as if to
emphasise their dislike of Wright, the Anti-Rent delegates indorsed
John Young for governor and Addison Gardiner for lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>In the midst of the campaign William C. Bouck received the federal
appointment of sub-treasurer in New York, under the act
re-establishing the independent treasury system. This office was one
of the most important in the gift of the President, and, because the
appointee was the recognised head of the Hunkers, the impression
immediately obtained that the government at Washington disapproved the
re-election of Silas Wright. It became the sensation of the hour. Many
believed the success of the Governor would make him a formidable
candidate for President in 1848, and the impropriety of Polk's action
occasioned much adverse criticism. The President and several members
of his Cabinet privately assured the Governor of their warmest
friendship, but, as one member of the radical wing expressed it,
&quot;Bouck's appointment became a significant indication of the guillotine
prepared for Governor Wright in November.&quot;</p>

<p>Other causes than the Democratic feud also contributed to the
discomfiture of Silas Wright. John Young had made an admirable record
in the Assembly. He had also, at the outbreak of hostilities with
Mexico, although formerly opposed to the annexation of Texas, been
among the first to approve the war, declaring that &quot;Texas was now bone
of our bone, flesh of our flesh, and that since the rights of our
citizens had been trampled upon, he would sustain the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.120" id="Page_ii.120">ii. 120</a></span> right
or wrong.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It soon became evident, too, that the Anti-Renters were
warm and persistent friends. His promise to pardon their leaders
received the severe condemnation of the conservative Whig papers; but
such censure only added to his vote in Anti-Rent counties. In like
manner, Young's support of the canals and Wright's veto of the
appropriation, strengthened the one and weakened the other in all the
canal counties. Indeed, after the election it was easy to trace all
these influences. Oneida, a strong canal county, which had given
Wright eight hundred majority in 1844, now gave Young thirteen
hundred. Similar results appeared in Lewis, Alleghany, Herkimer, and
other canal counties. In Albany, an Anti-Rent county, the Whig
majority of twenty-five was increased to twenty-eight hundred, while
Delaware, another Anti-Rent stronghold, changed Wright's majority of
nine hundred in 1844, to eighteen hundred for Young. On the other
hand, in New York City, where the conservative Whig papers had
bitterly assailed their candidate, Wright's majority of thirty-three
hundred in 1844 was increased to nearly fifty-two hundred. In the
State Young's majority over Wright exceeded eleven thousand,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and
Gardiner's over Fish was more than thirteen thousand. The
Anti-Renters, who had also indorsed one Whig and one Democratic canal
commissioner, gave them majorities of seven and thirteen thousand
respectively. Of eight senators chosen, the Whigs elected five; and of
the one hundred and twenty-eight assemblymen, sixty-eight, the
minority being made up of fifty Democrats and ten Anti-Renters. The
Whig returns also included twenty-three out of thirty-four
congressmen.</p>

<p>It was a sweeping victory&#8212;one of the sporadic kind that occur in
moments of political unrest when certain classes are in rebellion
against some phase of existing conditions. Seward, who happened to be
in Albany over Sunday, pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.121" id="Page_ii.121">ii. 121</a></span> the situation in one of his racy
letters. &quot;To-day,&quot; he says, &quot;I have been at St. Peter's and heard one
of those excellent discourses of Dr. Potter. There was such a jumble
of wrecks of party in the church that I forgot the sermon and fell to
moralising on the vanity of political life. You know my seat. Well,
half-way down the west aisle sat Silas Wright, wrapped in a coat
tightly buttoned to the chin, looking philosophy, which it is hard to
affect and harder to attain. On the east side sat Daniel D. Barnard,
upon whom 'Anti-Rent' has piled Ossa, while Pelion only has been
rolled upon Wright. In the middle of the church was Croswell, who
seemed to say to Wright, 'You are welcome to the gallows you erected
for me.' On the opposite side sat John Young, the <i>saved</i> among the
lost politicians. He seemed complacent and satisfied.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The defeat of Silas Wright caused no real surprise. It seemed to be in
the air. Everything was against him save his own personal influence,
based upon his sincerity, integrity, and lofty patriotism. Seward had
predicted the result at the time of Wright's nomination in 1844, and
Wright himself had anticipated it. &quot;I told some friends when I
consented to take this office,&quot; he wrote John Fine, his Canton friend,
in March, 1846, &quot;that it would terminate my public life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But the
story of Silas Wright's administration as governor was not all a
record of success. He was opposed to a constitutional convention as
well as to a canal appropriation, and, by wisely preventing the
former, it is likely the latter would not have been forced upon him.
Without a convention bill and a canal veto, the party would not have
divided seriously, John Young would not have become a popular hero,
and the Anti-Renters could not have held the balance of power. To
prevent the calling of a constitutional convention, therefore, or at
least to have confined it within limits approved by the Hunkers, was
the Governor's great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.122" id="Page_ii.122">ii. 122</a></span> opportunity. It would not have been an easy
task. William C. Crain had a profound conviction on the subject, and
back of him stood Michael Hoffman, the distinguished and unrelenting
Radical, determined to put the act of 1842 into the organic law of the
State. But there was a time when a master of political diplomacy could
have controlled the situation. Even after permitting Crain's defeat
for speaker, the appointment of Michael Hoffman to the judgeship
vacated by Samuel Nelson's transfer to the federal bench would have
placed a powerful lever in the Governor's hand. Hoffman had not sought
the office, but the appointment would have softened him into a friend,
and with Michael Hoffman as an ally, Crain and his legislative
followers could have been controlled.</p>

<p>It is interesting to study the views of Wright's contemporaries as to
the causes of his defeat.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> One thought he should have forced the
convention and veto issues in the campaign of 1845, compelling people
and press to thresh them out a year in advance of his own candidacy;
another believed if he had vetoed the convention bill a canal
appropriation would not have passed; a third charged him with trusting
too much in old friends who misguided him, and too little in new
principles that had sprung up while he was absent in the United States
Senate. One writer, apparently the most careful observer, admitted the
influence of Anti-Renters and the unpopularity of the canal veto, but
insisted that the real cause of the Governor's defeat was the
opposition of the Hunkers, &quot;bound together exclusively by selfish
interests and seeking only personal advancement and personal
gain.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.123" id="Page_ii.123">ii. 123</a></span> This writer named Edwin Croswell as the leader whose wide
influence rested like mildew upon the work of the campaign, sapping it
of enthusiasm, and encouraging Democrats among Anti-Renters and those
favourable to canals to put in the knife on election day. Such a
policy, of course, it was argued, meant the delivery of Polk from a
powerful opponent in 1848, and the uninterrupted leadership of William
L. Marcy, who now wielded a patronage, greatly increased by the
Mexican War, in the interest of the Hunkers and for the defeat of
Silas Wright. If this were not true, continued the writer, William C.
Bouck's appointment would have been delayed until after election, and
the work of postmasters and other government officials, who usually
contributed generously of their time and means in earnest support of
their party, would not have been deadened.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that Governor Wright held similar views. &quot;I
have neither time nor disposition to speak of the causes of our
overthrow,&quot; he wrote, a few days after his defeat was assured. &quot;The
time will come when they must be spoken of, and that plainly, but it
will be a painful duty, and one which I do not want to perform. Our
principles are as sound as they ever were, and the hearts of the great
mass of our party will be found as true to them as ever. Hereafter I
think our enemies will be open enemies, and against such the democracy
has ever been able, and ever will be able to contend
successfully.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Silas Wright's defeat in no wise pained him personally. Like John Jay
he had the habits of seclusion. Manual labour on the farm, his
correspondence, and the preparation of an address to be delivered at
the State Agricultural Fair in Sep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.124" id="Page_ii.124">ii. 124</a></span>tember, occupied his leisure during
the spring and summer of 1847.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> &quot;If I were to attempt to tell you
how happy we make ourselves at our retired home,&quot; he wrote Governor
Fairfield of Maine, &quot;I fear you would scarcely be able to credit me. I
even yet realise, every day and every hour, the relief from public
cares, and if any thought about temporal affairs could make me more
uneasy than another, it would be the serious one that I was again to
take upon myself, in any capacity, that ever pressing load.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This
was written on the 16th of August, 1847, and on the morning of the
27th his useful life came to an end. The day before he had spoken of
apoplexy in connection with the death of a friend, as if he, too, had
a premonition of this dread disease. When the end came, the sudden
rush of blood to the head left no doubt of its presence.</p>

<p>The death of Silas Wright produced a profound sensation. Since the
decease of DeWitt Clinton the termination of no public career in the
State caused more real sorrow. Until then, the people scarcely
realised how much they loved and respected him, and all were quick to
admit that the history of the Commonwealth furnished few natures
better fitted than his, morally and intellectually, for great public
trusts. Perhaps he cannot be called a man of genius; but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.125" id="Page_ii.125">ii. 125</a></span> a man
of commanding ability, with that absolute probity and good sense which
are the safest gifts of a noble character.</p>

<p>On the 12th of the following December, James Kent died in his
eighty-fifth year. He had outlived by eighteen years his contemporary,
John Jay; by nearly forty-five years his great contemporary, Alexander
Hamilton; and by more than thirty years his distinguished predecessor,
Chancellor Livingston. He was the last of the heroic figures that made
famous the closing quarter of the eighteenth and the opening quarter
of the nineteenth centuries. He could sit at the table of Philip Hone,
amidst eminent judges, distinguished statesmen, and men whose names
were already famous in literature, and talk of the past with personal
knowledge from the time the colony graciously welcomed John Murray,
Earl of Dunmore, as its governor, or threateningly frowned upon
William Howe, viscount and British general, for shutting up its civil
courts. When, finally, his body was transferred from the sofa in the
library where he had written himself into an immortal fame, to the

<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> fearless stand of Preston King in supporting the Wilmot
Proviso<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> took root among the Radicals, as Seward prophesied, and
the exclusion of slavery from territory obtained from Mexico, became
the dominant Democratic issue in the State. Because of their approval
of this principle the Radicals were called &quot;Barnburners.&quot; Originally,
these factional differences, as noted elsewhere, grew out of the canal
controversy in 1838 and in 1841, the Conservatives wishing to devote
the surplus canal revenues to the completion of the canals&#8212;the
Radicals insisting upon their use to pay the state debt. Under this
division, Edwin Croswell, William C. Bouck, Daniel S. Dickinson, Henry
A. Foster, and Horatio Seymour led the Conservatives; Michael Hoffman,
John A. Dix, and Azariah C. Flagg marshalled the Radicals. When the
Conservatives, &quot;hankering&quot; after the offices, accepted unconditionally
the annexation of Texas, they were called Hunkers. In like manner, the
Radicals who sustained the Wilmot Proviso now became Barnburners,
being likened to the farmer who burned his barn to get rid of rats.
William L. Marcy, Silas Wright, Benjamin F. Butler, and the Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.127" id="Page_ii.127">ii. 127</a></span>
Burens took no part in the canal controversy; but after Martin Van
Buren's defeat in 1844 Marcy became a prominent Hunker and entered
Polk's Cabinet, while Wright, Butler, and the Van Burens joined the
Barnburners.</p>

<p>Hostilities between the Hunkers and Barnburners, growing out of the
slavery question, began at the Democratic state convention, which
convened at Syracuse, September 7, 1847.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Preceding this meeting
both factions had been active, but the Hunkers, having succeeded in
seating a majority of the delegates, promptly voted down a resolution
embodying the principle of the Wilmot Proviso. Then the Barnburners
seceded. There was no parleying. The breach opened like a chasm and
the secessionists walked out in a body. This action was followed by an
address, charging that the anti-slavery resolution had been defeated
by a fraudulent organisation, and calling a mass convention for
October 26, &quot;to avow their principles and consult as to future
action.&quot; This meeting became a gathering of Martin Van Buren's
friends. It did not nominate a ticket, which would have defeated the
purpose of the secession; but, by proclaiming the principles of
Free-soil, it struck the keynote of popular sentiment; divided the
Democratic party, and let the Whigs into power by thirty thousand
majority. It made Millard Fillmore comptroller, Christopher Morgan
secretary of state, Alvah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.128" id="Page_ii.128">ii. 128</a></span> Hunt treasurer, Ambrose L. Jordan
attorney-general, and Hamilton Fish lieutenant-governor to fill the
vacancy occasioned by Addison Gardiner's election to the new Court of
Appeals. The president of this seceders' mass-meeting was Churchill C.
Cambreling, an old associate of Martin Van Buren, but its leader and
inspiration was John Van Buren. He drafted the address to the people,
his eloquence made him its chief orator, and his enthusiasm seemed to
endow him with ubiquity.</p>

<p>John Van Buren was unlike the ordinary son of a President of the
United States. He did not rely upon the influence or the prestige of
his father.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He was able to stand alone&#8212;a man of remarkable power,
who became attorney-general in 1845, and for ten years was a marked
figure in political circles, his bland and convulsing wit enlivening
every convention and adding interest to every campaign. But his chief
interest was in his profession. He was a lawyer of great distinction,
the peer and often the opponent of Charles O'Conor and William H.
Seward. &quot;He possessed beyond any man I ever knew,&quot; said Daniel Lord,
&quot;the power of eloquent, illustrative amplification, united with close,
flexible logic.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>John Van Buren had, as well, a picturesque side to his life. In
college he was expert at billiards, the centre of wit, and the willing
target of beauty. Out of college, from the time he danced with the
Princess Victoria at a court ball in London at the age of twenty-two,
to the end of his interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.129" id="Page_ii.129">ii. 129</a></span> and eventful life, he was known as
&quot;Prince John.&quot; His remarkable gifts opened the door to all that was
ultra as well as noble. He led in the ballroom, he presided at
dinners, he graced every forum, and he moved in the highest social
circles. Men marvelled at his knowledge, at his unfailing equanimity,
and at his political strength; but even to those who were spellbound
by his eloquence, or captivated by his adroit, skilful conduct of a
lawsuit, he was always &quot;Prince John.&quot; There was not a drop of
austerity or intolerance or personal hatred in him. The Dutch blood of
his father, traced from the Princes of Orange to the days of the New
Netherland patroons, kept him within the limits of moderation if not
entirely unspotted, and his finished manners attracted the common
people as readily as they charmed the more exclusive.</p>

<p>John Van Buren's acceptance of Free-soilism did not emanate from a
dislike of slavery; nor did Free-soil principles root themselves
deeply in his nature. His father had opposed the admission of Texas,
and the son, in resentment of his defeat, hoping to make an
anti-slavery party dominant in the State, if not in the nation,
proclaimed his opposition to the extension of slavery. But, after the
compromise measures of 1850 had temporarily checked the movement, he
fell back into the ranks of the Hunkers, aiding President Pierce's
election, and sustaining the pro-slavery administration of Buchanan.
In after years Van Buren frequently explained his connection with the
Free-soil revolt by telling a story of the boy who was vigorously
removing an overturned load of hay at the roadside. Noticing his wild
and rapid pitching, a passer-by inquired the cause of his haste. The
boy, wiping the perspiration from his brow as he pointed to the pile
of hay, replied, &quot;Stranger, <i>dad's under there</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>But whatever reasons incited John Van Buren to unite with the
Free-soilers, so long as he advocated their principles, he was the
most brilliant crusader who sought to stay the aggressiveness of
slavery. From the moment he withdrew from the Syracuse convention, in
the autumn of 1847,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.130" id="Page_ii.130">ii. 130</a></span> until he finally accepted the compromise measures
of 1850, he was looked upon as the hope of the Barnburners and the
most dangerous foe of the Hunkers. Even Horatio Seymour was afraid of
him. He did not advocate abolition; he did not treat slavery in the
abstract; he did not transcend the Free-soil doctrine. But he spoke
with such power and brilliancy that Henry Wilson, afterward Vice
President, declared him &quot;the bright particular star of the
revolt.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> He was not an impassioned orator. He spoke deliberately,
and rarely with animation or with gesture; and his voice, high pitched
and penetrating, was neither mellow nor melodious. But he was
marvellously pleasing. His perennial wit kept his audiences expectant,
and his compact, forceful utterances seemed to break the argument of
an opponent as a hammer shatters a pane of glass. So great was his
popularity at this time, that his return to the Democratic party
became a personal sorrow to every friend of the anti-slavery cause.
&quot;Indeed, such was the brilliant record he then made,&quot; says Henry
Wilson, &quot;that had he remained true to the principles he advocated, he
would unquestionably have become one of the foremost men of the
Republican party, if not its accepted leader.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Several historic conventions followed the secession of the
Barnburners. Each faction held a state convention to select delegates
to the Democratic national convention which met in Baltimore on May
22, 1848, and, on the appointed day, both Hunkers and Barnburners
presented full delegations, each claiming admission to the exclusion
of the other.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It was an anxious moment for Democracy. New York
held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.131" id="Page_ii.131">ii. 131</a></span> key to the election; without its vote the party could not
hope to win; and without harmony success was impossible. To exclude
either faction, therefore, was political suicide, and, in the end, the
vote was divided equally between them. To the politician, anxious for
party success and hungry for office, perhaps no other compromise
seemed possible. But the device failed to satisfy either side, and
Lewis Cass was nominated for President without the participation of
the State that must elect or defeat him.</p>

<p>Returning home, the Barnburners issued an address, written by Samuel
J. Tilden, who fearlessly called upon Democrats to act independently.
This led to the famous convention held at Utica in June. Samuel Young
presided, Churchill C. Cambreling was conspicuous on the stage, David
Dudley Field read a letter from Martin Van Buren condemning the
platform and the candidate of the Baltimore convention, and Benjamin
F. Butler, Preston King, and John Van Buren illuminated the principles
of the Free-soil party in speeches that have seldom been surpassed in
political conventions. In the end Martin Van Buren was nominated for
President.</p>

<p>This assembly, in the ability and character of its members, contained
the better portion of the party. Its attitude was strong, defiant, and
its only purpose apparently was to create a public sentiment hostile
to the extension of slavery. Nevertheless, it was divided into two
factions, one actuated more by a desire to avenge the alleged wrongs
of Van Buren, than to limit slavery. To this class belonged Churchill
C. Cambreling, Samuel J. Tilden, John A. Dix, Sanford E. Church, Dean
Richmond, John Cochrane, Benjamin F. Butler, and the Van Burens. On
the anti-slavery side, Preston King, David Dudley Field, James S.
Wadsworth, and William Cullen Bryant were conspicuous. Seven years
later, these men were quick to aid in the formation of the Republican
party; while the former, for the most part, continued with the
Democratic party. But, whatever the motives that prompted them, their
action strengthened the Buffalo con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.132" id="Page_ii.132">ii. 132</a></span>vention<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> which met on August 9,
1848, giving an impetus to the anti-slavery cause too strong for
resentment or revenge to guide it.</p>

<p>There have been many important meetings in the history of American
politics, but it may well be doubted if any convention, during the
struggle with slavery, ever exalted the hearts of those who took part
in it more than did this assembly of fearless representatives of the
Free-soil party in Buffalo, the Queen City of the Lakes. The time was
ripe for action, and on that day in August, men eminent and to grow
eminent, sought the shade of a great tent on the eastern shore of Lake
Erie. Among them were Joshua R. Giddings, the well-known Abolitionist;
Salmon P. Chase, not yet famous, but soon to become a United States
senator with views of slavery in accord with William H. Seward; and
Charles Francis Adams who had already associated his name with that of
his illustrious father in the growth of anti-slavery opinions in New
England. Chase presided over the convention and Adams over the
mass-meeting. At the outset, it was boldly asserted that they had
assembled &quot;to secure free soil for a free people;&quot; and in closing they
thrilled the hearts of all hearers with the memorable declaration that
rang throughout the land like a blast from a trumpet, &quot;We inscribe on
our banner Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labour, and Free Men.&quot; It was
a remarkable convention in that it made no mistakes. Lewis Cass
represented the South and its purposes, while Zachary Taylor lived in
the South and owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.133" id="Page_ii.133">ii. 133</a></span> four hundred slaves. Neither of these men could
be supported; but, in the end, rather than put a fourth candidate into
the field, it was resolved unanimously to indorse Martin Van Buren for
President and Charles Francis Adams for Vice President. Daniel Webster
ridiculed the idea of &quot;the leader of the Free-<i>spoil</i> party becoming
the leader of the Free-soil party;&quot; but Charles Sumner, whose heart
was in the cause, declared that &quot;it is not for the Van Buren of 1838
that we are to vote, but for the Van Buren of to-day&#8212;the veteran
statesman, sagacious, determined, experienced, who, at an age when
most men are rejoicing to put off their armour, girds himself anew and
enters the list as a champion of freedom.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> To give further dignity
and importance to the Free-soil movement, the nomination of John P.
Hale, made by the Abolitionists in the preceding November, was
withdrawn, and John A. Dix, then a Democratic senator, accepted the
Barnburners' nomination for governor.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.134" id="Page_ii.134">ii. 134</a></span></p><p>The Hunkers were aghast. The movement that let the Whigs into power in
1847 had suddenly become a national party, with the most famous and
distinguished Democrat at its head, while the old issues of internal
improvement, the tariff, and the independent treasury were obscured by
the intensity of the people's opposition to the extension of slavery.
The Hunkers controlled the party machinery&#8212;the Barnburners held the
balance of power. To add to the bitterness of the situation, Edwin
Croswell, after a quarter of a century of leadership, had retired from
editorial and political life, leaving no one who could fill his place.
When the Democratic state convention assembled at Syracuse, therefore,
it spent itself in rhetorical denunciation of the rebellious faction,
and wasted itself in the selection of Reuben H. Walworth for governor
and Charles O'Conor for lieutenant-governor. Neither was a popular
nomination. Walworth was the last of the chancellors. He came into
notice as an ardent Bucktail in the days of DeWitt Clinton, and, upon
the retirement of Chancellor Kent in 1828 succeeded to that important
and lucrative office. He was a hard worker and an upright judge; but
he did not rank as a great jurist. The lawyers thought him slow and
crabbed, and his exclusion from the office at the age of fifty-nine,
after the adoption of the new Constitution in 1846, was not regretted.
But Chancellor Walworth had two traits which made him a marked figure
in the Commonwealth&#8212;an enthusiasm for his profession that spared no
labour and left no record unsearched; and an enthusiastic love for the
Church.</p>

<p>Of Charles O'Conor's remarkable abilities, mention occurs elsewhere.
His conservatism made him a Democrat of the extreme school. In the
Slave Jack case and the Lemmon slave case, very famous in their day,
he was counsel for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.135" id="Page_ii.135">ii. 135</a></span> slave-holders; and at the close of the Civil
War he became the attorney for Jefferson Davis when indicted for
treason. O'Conor's great power as a speaker added much to the
entertainment of the campaign of 1848, but whether he would have
beaten his sincere, large-hearted, and affectionate Whig opponent had
no third party divided the vote, was a mooted question at the time,
and one usually settled in favour of the Chautauquan.</p>

<p>The Whigs had reason to be hopeful. They had elected Young in 1846 by
eleven thousand, and, because of the Barnburner secession, had carried
the State in 1847 by thirty thousand. Everything indicated that their
success in 1848 would be no less sweeping. But they were far from
happy. Early in June, 1846, long before the capture of Monterey and
the victory of Buena Vista, the Albany <i>Evening Journal</i> had suggested
that Zachary Taylor was in the minds of many, and in the hearts of
more, for President in 1848. Thurlow Weed went further. He sent word
to the brilliant officer that he need not reply to the numerous
letters from men of all political stripes offering their support,
since the presidential question would take care of itself after his
triumphant return from Mexico. But, in the spring of 1848, the
question became embarrassing. Taylor was a slave-holder. Many northern
Whigs were deeply imbued with anti-slavery sentiments, and the action
of the Free-soilers was increasing their sensitiveness. &quot;What plagues
me most of all,&quot; wrote Washington Hunt to Weed, &quot;is to think how I,
after all I have said against slavery and its extension, am to look
the Wilmot Proviso people in the face and ask them to vote for a
Southern slave-holder.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Yet Taylor was a conquering hero; and,
although little was known of his political sentiments or sympathies,
it was generally believed the Democrats would nominate him for
President if the Whigs did not.</p>

<p>As the year grew older it became apparent that Henry Clay was the
choice of a large portion of the Whigs of the country. Besides, Daniel
Webster had reappeared as a can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.136" id="Page_ii.136">ii. 136</a></span>didate; Winfield Scott had the support
of his former New York friends; and Horace Greeley, &quot;waging a quixotic
war against heroes,&quot; as Seward expressed it, was sure of defeating
Taylor even if shaken in his confidence of nominating Clay. &quot;I hope
you see your way through this difficulty,&quot; Hunt again wrote Weed. &quot;You
are like a deacon I know. His wife said it always came natural to him
to see into the doctrine of election.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Weed believed that Zachary
Taylor, if not nominated by the Whigs, would be taken up by the
Democrats, and he favoured the Southerner because the election of
Jackson and Harrison convinced him that winning battles opened a sure
way to the White House. But Thurlow Weed was not a stranger to
Taylor's sympathies. He had satisfied himself that the bluff old
warrior, though a native of Virginia and a Louisiana slave-holder,
favoured domestic manufactures, opposed the admission of Texas, and
had been a lifelong admirer of Henry Clay; and, with this information,
he went to work, cautiously as was his custom, but with none the less
energy and persistence. Among other things, he visited Daniel Webster
at Marshfield to urge him to accept the nomination for Vice President.
The great statesman recalled Weed's similar errand in 1839, and the
memory of Harrison's sudden death now softened him into a receptive
mood; but the inopportune coming of Fletcher Webster, who reported
that his father's cause was making tremendous progress, changed
consent into disapproval, and for the second time in ten years Webster
lost the opportunity of becoming President.</p>

<p>When the Whig national convention met in Philadelphia on June 8,
Thurlow Weed did not doubt the ability of Taylor's friends to nominate
him; but, in that event, several prominent delegates threatened to
bolt. It was an anxious moment. The success of the Whig party and the
ascendancy of Weed's leadership in New York were at stake. It was
urged by the anti-slavery men with great vehemence that Taylor was a
&quot;no-party man,&quot; and that as a born Southerner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.137" id="Page_ii.137">ii. 137</a></span> and large slave-holder
he could not be trusted on the slavery question. But when the five
candidates were finally placed in nomination, and a single ballot
taken, it was found, as Weed had predicted, that the hero of Buena
Vista was the one upon whom the Whigs could best unite. With few
exceptions, the friends of Clay, Webster, Scott, and John M. Clayton
could go to Taylor better than to another, and on the fourth ballot,
amidst anger and disappointment, the latter was nominated by sixty
majority.</p>

<p>For the moment, the office of Vice President seemed to go a-begging,
as it did in the convention of 1839 after the defeat of Henry Clay.
Early in the year Seward's friends urged his candidacy; but he gave it
no encouragement, preferring to continue the practice of his
profession, which was now large and lucrative. John Young, who thought
he would like the place, sent a secret agent to Mexico with letters to
Taylor. Young's record as governor, however, did not commend him for
other honours, and the scheme was soon abandoned. As the summer
advanced Abbott Lawrence of Massachusetts became the favourite; and
for a time it seemed as if his nomination would be made by
acclamation; but, after Taylor's nomination and Clay's defeat, many
delegates promptly declared they would not have &quot;cotton at both ends
of the ticket&quot;&#8212;referring to Taylor as a grower and Lawrence as a
manufacturer of cotton. In this crisis, and after a stormy recess,
John A. Collier, a leading lawyer of Binghamton, who had served in the
Twenty-second Congress and one year as state comptroller, suddenly
took the platform. In a stirring speech, in which he eloquently
pictured the sorrow and bitterness of Clay's friends, he hopefully
announced that he had a peace-offering to present, which, if accepted,
would, in a measure, reconcile the supporters of all the defeated
candidates and prevent a fatal breach in the party. Then, to the
astonishment of the convention, he named Millard Fillmore for Vice
President, and asked a unanimous response to his nomination. This
speech, though not pitched in a very exalted key, was so subtile and
telling, that it threw the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.138" id="Page_ii.138">ii. 138</a></span>vention into applause. Collier recalled
Fillmore's fidelity to his party; his satisfactory record in Congress,
especially during the passage of the tariff act of 1842; his splendid,
if unsuccessful canvass, as a candidate for governor in 1844, and his
recent majority of thirty-eight thousand for comptroller, the largest
ever given any candidate in the State. At the time, it looked as if a
unanimous response might be made; but the friends of Lawrence rallied,
and at the close of the ballot Fillmore had won by only six votes. For
Collier, however, it was a great triumph, giving him a reputation as a
speaker that later efforts did not sustain.</p>

<p>To anti-slavery delegates, the Philadelphia convention was a
disappointment. It seemed to lack courage and to be without
convictions or principles. Like its predecessor in 1839 it adopted no
resolutions and issued no address. The candidates became its platform.
In voting down a resolution in favour of the Wilmot Proviso, many
delegates believed the party would prove faithless on the great issue;
and fifteen of them, led by Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, proposed a
national convention of all persons opposed to the extension of
slavery, to be held at Buffalo early in August. &quot;It is fortunate for
us,&quot; wrote Seward, &quot;that the Democratic party is divided.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But the
New Yorkers, some of whom found encouragement in the nomination of
Fillmore, who had thus far been inflexible upon the slavery question,
patiently waited for the result of the Whig state convention, which
met at Utica on the 14th of September. By this time, as Seward and
Weed predicted, Taylor's nomination had grown popular. Greeley, soon
to be a candidate for Congress, advised the <i>Tribune's</i> readers to
vote the Whig ticket, while the action of the Buffalo convention,
though it united the anti-slavery vote, assured a division of the
Democratic party more than sufficient to compensate for any Whig
losses. Under these circumstances, the Utica convention assembled with
reasonable hopes of success. It lacked the spirit of the band of
resolute Free-soilers, who met in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.139" id="Page_ii.139">ii. 139</a></span> the same place on the same day and
nominated John A. Dix for governor and Seth M. Gates of Wyoming for
lieutenant-governor; but it gave no evidence of the despair that had
settled upon the convention of the Hunkers in the preceding week.</p>

<p>One feature of the Whig state convention is worthy of notice. The
great influence of the Anti-Renters who held the balance of power in
the convention of 1846 had disappeared. The Governor's anti-rent
friends urged his renomination with the earnest voice of a brave
people; but John Young was destined to be the comet of a season only.
His course in respect to appointments and to the Mexican War had
alienated Thurlow Weed, and his pardon of the anti-rent rioters
estranged the conservative Whigs. Although a shrewd politician, with
frank and affable manners, as an administrative officer he lacked the
tact displayed so abundantly as a legislator; and its absence
seriously handicapped him. Twenty delegates measured his strength in a
convention that took forty-nine votes to nominate. Under the Taylor
administration, Young received an appointment as assistant treasurer
in New York City&#8212;the office given to William C. Bouck in 1846&#8212;but
his career may be said to have closed the moment he promised to pardon
a lot of murderous rioters to secure an election as governor. With
that, he passed out of the real world of state-craft into the class of
politicians whose ambition and infirmities have destroyed their
usefulness. He died in April, 1852, at the age of fifty.</p>

<p>Hamilton Fish was the favourite candidate for governor in the Utica
convention. His sympathies leaned toward the conservatives of his
party; but the moderation of his speech and his conciliatory manners
secured the good wishes of both factions, and he received seventy-six
votes on the first ballot. Fish was admittedly one of the most popular
young men in New York City. He had never sought or desired office. In
1842, the friends of reform sent him to Congress from a strong
Democratic district, and in 1846, after repeatedly and peremptorily
declining, the Whig convention, to save the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.140" id="Page_ii.140">ii. 140</a></span> party from disruption,
compelled him to take the nomination for lieutenant-governor on the
ticket with John Young. In 1847, after Addison Gardiner, by his
appointment to the Court of Appeals, had vacated the
lieutenant-governorship, the convention, in resentment of Fish's
defeat by the Anti-Renters, again forced his nomination for the same
office, and his election followed by thirty thousand majority. Fish
was now thirty-nine years old, with more than two-score and five years
to live. He was to become a United States senator, and to serve, for
eight years, with distinguished ability, as secretary of state in the
Cabinet of President Grant; yet, in all that period, he never departed
from the simple, sincere life that he was living in September, 1848.
Writing of him in the <i>Tribune</i>, on the day after his nomination for
governor, Horace Greeley voiced the sentiment of men irrespective of
party. &quot;Wealthy without pride, generous without ostentation, simple in
manners, blameless in life, and accepting office with no other
aspiration than that of making power subserve the common good of his
fellow citizens, Hamilton Fish justly and eminently enjoys the
confidence and esteem of all who know him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>On the first ballot, George W. Patterson of Chautauqua received
eighty-four out of ninety-six votes for lieutenant-governor. In his
gentle manners, simple generosity, and moderation of speech, Patterson
was not unlike Hamilton Fish. He was a loyal friend of Seward, a
constant correspondent of Weed, and a member of the inner circle of
governing Whigs; he had been prominent as an Anti-Mason, satisfactory
as a legislator, and impartial as a speaker of the Assembly; he was
now recognised as a far-sighted, wise, and cautious politician. In
guiding the convention to the selection of Hamilton Fish and George W.
Patterson, it was admitted that Thurlow Weed's leadership vindicated
his sagacity.</p>

<p>The political contest in New York, unlike that in the South and in
some Western States, presented the novel feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.141" id="Page_ii.141">ii. 141</a></span> three powerful
parties in battle array. The Free-soil faction was a strange mixture.
Besides Barnburners, there were Conscience Whigs, Proviso Democrats,
Land Reformers, Workingmen, and Abolitionists&#8212;a formidable
combination of able and influential men who wielded the power of
absolute disinterestedness, and who kept step with John Van Buren's
trenchant and eloquent speeches which resounded through the State. Van
Buren was the accepted leader, and in this campaign he reached the
height of his reputation. His features were not striking, but in
person he was tall, symmetrical, and graceful; and no one in the State
could hold an audience with such delightful oratory and lofty
eloquence.</p>

<p>The ablest Whig to oppose him was William H. Seward, who frequently
followed him in localities where Whigs were likely to act with the
Free-soil party. On the slavery question, Seward held views identical
with those expressed by Van Buren; but he insisted that every Whig
vote cast for the third party was only a negative protest against the
slavery party. Real friends of emancipation must not be content with
protests. They must act wisely and efficiently. &quot;For myself,&quot; he
declared, &quot;I shall cast my suffrage for General Taylor and Millard
Fillmore, freely and conscientiously, on precisely the same grounds on
which I have hitherto voted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>As in former presidential years, each party had its flags and banners,
its drums and cannon, its bewildering variety of inscriptions and
mottoes, and its multitude of speakers charging and countercharging
inconsistencies and maladministration. The Whigs accused Cass with
having printed two biographies, one for the South, in which he
appeared as a slavery extensionist, and one for the North, in which he
figured as a Wilmot Provisoist. To this accusation, Democrats retorted
that the Whigs opposed annexation in the North and favoured it in the
South; denounced the war and nominated its leading general; voted down
the Wilmot Proviso in June, and upheld it in July.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.142" id="Page_ii.142">ii. 142</a></span></p>

<p>In New York, New England, and in some parts of the West, the clear,
comprehensive, ringing platform of the anti-slavery party had fixed
the issue. Audiences became restless if asked to listen to arguments
upon other topics. Opposition to slavery was, at last, respectable in
politics. For the first time, none of his party deprecated Seward's
advanced utterances upon this question, and from August to November he
freely voiced his opinions. The series of professional achievements
which began with the Freeman case was still in progress; but he laid
them aside that he might pass through his own State into New England,
and from thence through New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, into Ohio,
where the result, as shown by the October election, was to be very
close.</p>

<p>Seward was now in the fulness of his intellectual power. There was
nothing sensational, nothing unfit in his speeches. He believed that
the conscience of the people was a better guide than individual
ambitions, and he inspired them with lofty desires and filled them
with sound principles of action. &quot;There are two antagonistic elements
of society in America,&quot; said he, in his speech at Cleveland, &quot;freedom
and slavery. Freedom is in harmony with our system of government and
with the spirit of the age, and is, therefore, passive and quiescent.
Slavery is in conflict with that system, with justice, and with
humanity, and is, therefore, organised, defensive, active, and
perpetually aggressive. Freedom insists on the emancipation and
elevation of labour. Slavery demands a soil moistened with tears and
blood. These elements divide and classify the American people into two
parties. Each of these parties has its court and sceptre. The throne
of the one is amid the rocks of the Allegheny Mountains; the throne of
the other is reared on the sands of South Carolina. One of these
parties, the party of slavery, regards disunion as among the means of
defence and not always the last to be employed. The other maintains
the Union of the States, one and inseparable, now and forever, as the
highest duty of the American people to themselves, to posterity, to
mankind. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.143" id="Page_ii.143">ii. 143</a></span> is written in the Constitution that five slaves shall
count equal to three freemen as a basis of representation, and it is
written also, in violation of the Divine Law, that we shall surrender
the fugitive slave who takes refuge at our fireside from his
relentless pursuers. 'What, then,' you say; 'can nothing be done for
freedom because the public conscience is inert?' Yes, much can be
done&#8212;everything can be done. Slavery can be limited to its present
bounds; it can be ameliorated; it can and must be abolished, and you
and I can and must do it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>This presented an epitome of Seward's views when spoken without
restraint. His friends thought them &quot;bold&quot; and his opponents denounced
them as &quot;most perverse and dogmatic,&quot; but, whether bold or perverse,
he devoted the chief part of every speech to them. He was not without
humour, man's highest gift, but he had more of humanity; he spoke
seriously and solemnly, usually to grave, sober, reflecting men of all
professions and parties; and, at the end of two hours, dismissed them
as if from an evening church service. At Boston, a Whig member of
Congress from Illinois spoke with him, principally upon the
maladministration of the Democrats and the inconsistencies of Lewis
Cass. After the meeting, while sitting in their hotel, the
congressman, with a thoughtful air, said to Seward: &quot;I have been
thinking about what you said in your speech to-night. I reckon you are
right. We have got to deal with this slavery question, and got to give
much more attention to it hereafter than we have been doing.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
This was Seward's first meeting with Abraham Lincoln. The former was
then forty-seven years old, the latter thirty-nine.</p>

<p>In New York, the campaign could have but one outcome. The Free-soil
faction divided the Democratic vote nearly by two, giving Van Buren
120,000, Cass 114,000, and Taylor 218,000. The returns for governor
varied but slightly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.144" id="Page_ii.144">ii. 144</a></span> these figures.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In the country at large
Taylor secured one hundred and sixty-three electoral votes and Cass
one hundred and twenty-seven. But, a Whig majority of one hundred and
four on joint ballot in the Legislature, and the election of
thirty-one out of thirty-four congressmen, showed the wreckage of a
divided Democracy in New York. The Hunkers elected only six
assemblymen; the Free-soilers secured fourteen. The Whigs had one
hundred and eight. Returns from all the counties and cities in no wise
differed. The Hunkers had been wiped out. If the Free-soilers did not
get office, they had demonstrated their strength, and exulted in
having routed their adversaries. Although Martin Van Buren was not to
leave his retirement at Lindenwald, the brilliant son had avenged his
father's wrongs by dashing Lewis Cass rudely and ruthlessly to the
ground.</p>

<br />
SEWARD SPLITS THE WHIG PARTY<br />
<br />
1849-1850</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Legislature of 1849 became the scene of a contest that ended in a
rout. John A. Dix's term as United States senator expired on March 4,
and the fight for the succession began the moment the Whig members
knew they had a majority.</p>

<p>William H. Seward's old enemies seemed ubiquitous. They had neither
forgotten his distribution of patronage, nor forgiven his interest in
slaves and immigrants. To make their opposition effective, John A.
Collier became a candidate. Collier wanted to be governor in 1838,
when Weed threw the nomination to Seward; and, although his election
as comptroller in 1841 had restored friendly relations with Weed, he
had never forgiven Seward. It added strength to the coalition,
moreover, that Fillmore and Collier were now bosom friends. The
latter's speech at Philadelphia had made the Buffalonian Vice
President, and his following naturally favoured Collier. It was a
noisy company, and, for a time, its opposition seemed formidable.</p>

<p>&quot;Fillmore and Collier came down the river in the boat with me,&quot; wrote
Seward from New York on November 16, 1848. &quot;The versatile people were
full of demonstrations of affection to the Vice President, and Mr.
Collier divided the honours. The politicians of New York are engaged
in plans to take possession of General Taylor before he comes to
Washington. Weed is to be supplanted, and that not for his own sake
but for mine.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> As the days passed intrigue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.146" id="Page_ii.146">ii. 146</a></span> became bolder.
Hamilton Fish, Washington Hunt, and other prominent members of the
party, were offered the senatorship. &quot;I wish you could see the letters
I get,&quot; Hunt wrote to Weed. &quot;If I wanted to excite your sympathy they
would be sufficient. Some say Seward will be elected. More say neither
Seward nor Collier will be chosen, but a majority are going for a
third man by way of compromise, and my consent is invoked to be number
three.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Then came the letter, purporting to be written by Seward,
declaring that &quot;Collier must be defeated, or our influence with the
Administration will be curtailed. You must look to your members, and
see the members from Cattaraugus, if possible. I think Patterson will
take care of Chautauqua.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Out of this forgery grew an acrimonious
manifesto from Collier, who professed to believe that Seward was
giving personal attention to the work of making himself senator. In
the midst of this violent and bitter canvass, Horace Greeley wrote one
of his characteristic editorials. &quot;We care not who may be the
nominee,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i> of January 24, 1849. &quot;We shall gladly
coincide in the fair expression of the will of the majority of the
party, but we kindly caution those who disturb and divide us, that
their conduct will result only in the merited retribution which an
indignant people will visit upon those who prostitute their temporary
power to personal pique or selfish purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>Seward was continuously in Baltimore and Washington, studying briefs
that had accumulated in his long absence during the campaign; but
Weed, the faithful friend, like a sentinel on the watch-tower, kept
closely in touch with the political situation. &quot;The day before the
legislative caucus,&quot; wrote an eye-witness, &quot;the Whig members of the
Legislature gathered around the editor of the <i>Evening Journal</i> for
counsel and advice. It resembled a President's levee. He remained
standing in the centre of the room, conversing with those about him
and shaking hands with new-comers; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.147" id="Page_ii.147">ii. 147</a></span> there was nothing in his
manner to indicate the slightest mystery or excitement so common with
politicians.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The Whig senators met in caucus on January 29, and by a vote of twelve
to eleven decided to join the Assembly. Then the fight began. William
S. Johnson, a Whig senator from New York City, declared that he would
neither vote for Seward in caucus nor support him in the Legislature.
&quot;It would be equivalent,&quot; he continued, &quot;to throwing a firebrand into
the South and aiding in the dissolution of the Whig party and of the
Union.&quot; Thereupon the eleven withdrew from further participation in
the proceedings. When the caucus of the two houses convened, fourteen
members declared it inexpedient to support either Seward or Collier;
but an informal ballot gave Seward eighty-eight votes and Collier
twelve, with twenty-two scattering. Three days later, on joint ballot,
Seward received one hundred and twenty-one out of one hundred and
thirty Whig votes. &quot;We were always confident that the caucus could
have but one result,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;and the lofty anticipations
which the prospect of Seward's election has excited will not be
disappointed.&quot;</p>

<p>Successful as Seward had been in his profession since leaving the
office of governor, he was not entirely happy. &quot;I look upon my life,
busy as it is, as a waste,&quot; he wrote, in 1847. &quot;I live in a world that
needs my sympathies, but I have not even time nor opportunity to do
good.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> His warm and affectionate heart seemed to envy the strife
and obloquy that came to champions of freedom; yet his published
correspondence nowhere directly indicates a desire to return to public
life. &quot;You are not to suppose me solicitous on the subject that drags
me so unpleasantly before the public,&quot; he wrote Weed on January 26,
1849, three days before the caucus. &quot;I have looked at it in all its
relations, and cannot satisfy myself that it would be any better for
me to succeed than to be beaten.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> This assumed indifference,
however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.148" id="Page_ii.148">ii. 148</a></span> was written with a feeling of absolute confidence that he
was to succeed, a confidence that brought with it great content, since
the United States Senate offered the &quot;opportunity&quot; for which he sighed
in his despondent letter of 1847. On the announcement of his election,
conveyed to him by wire at Washington, he betrayed no feeling except
one of humility. &quot;I tremble,&quot; he wrote his wife, &quot;when I think of the
difficulty of realising the expectations which this canvass has
awakened in regard to my abilities.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> To Weed, he added: &quot;I recall
with fresh gratitude your persevering and magnanimous
friendship.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>From the outset, difficulties confronted the new senator. The question
of limiting slavery excited the whole country, and one holding his
views belonged in the centre of the struggle. But strife for office
gave him more immediate embarrassment. Apprehensive of party discord,
Thurlow Weed, at a dinner given the Vice President and Senator, had
arranged for conferences between them upon important appointments
within the State; but Seward's first knowledge of the New York
custom-house appointments came to him in an executive session for
their confirmation. Seward, as Lincoln afterward said, &quot;was a man
without gall,&quot; and he did not openly resent the infraction of the
agreement; but when Weed, upon reaching Washington, discovered that
Fillmore had the ear of the simple and confiding President, he quickly
sought the Vice President. Fillmore received him coldly. From that
moment began an estrangement between Weed and the Buffalo statesman
which was to last until both were grown gray and civil war had
obliterated differences of political sentiment. For twenty years,
their intimacy had been uninterrupted and constantly strengthening.
Even upon the slavery question their views coincided, and, although
Fillmore chafed under his growing preference for Seward and the
latter's evident intellectual superiority, he had exhibited no
impatience toward Weed. But Fillmore was now Vice President, with
aspirations for the Presidency, and he saw in Seward a for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.149" id="Page_ii.149">ii. 149</a></span>midable
rival who would have the support of Weed whenever the Senator needed
it. He rashly made up his mind, therefore, to end their relationship.</p>

<p>With Taylor, Weed was at his ease. The President remembered the
editor's letter written in 1846, and what Weed now asked he quickly
granted. When Weed complained, therefore, that the Vice President was
filling federal offices with his own friends, the President dropped
Fillmore and turned to the Senator for suggestions. Seward accepted
the burden of looking after patronage. &quot;I detest and loathe this
running to the President every day to protest against this man or
that,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> he wrote; but the President cheerfully responded to his
requests. &quot;If the country is to be benefited by our services,&quot; he said
to the Secretary of the Treasury, &quot;it seems to me that you and I ought
to remember those to whose zeal, activity, and influence we are
indebted for our places.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>While Weed employed his time in displacing Hunker office-holders with
Whigs, the Democratic party was trying to reunite. It called for a
bold hand. John Van Buren, with a courage born of genius, had struck
it a terrible blow in the face of tremendous odds, the effect of which
was as gratifying to the Barnburners as it was disastrous to the
Hunkers. But, in 1849, the party professed to believe that a union of
the factions would result in victory, since their aggregate vote in
1848 exceeded the Whig vote by sixteen thousand. It is difficult to
realise the arguments which persuaded the Barnburners to rejoin their
adversaries whom they had declared, in no measured terms, to be guilty
of the basest conduct; but, after infinite labour, Horatio Seymour
established constructive harmony and practical co-operation. &quot;We are
asked to compromise our principles,&quot; said John Van Buren. &quot;The day of
compromises is past; but, in regard to candidates for state offices,
we are still a commercial people. We will unite with our late
antagonists.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.150" id="Page_ii.150">ii. 150</a></span></p>
<p>Seymour and Van Buren did not unite easily. From the first they were
rivals. As an orator, Seymour was the more persuasive, logical, and
candid&#8212;Van Buren the more witty, sarcastic, and brilliant. Seymour
was conciliatory&#8212;Van Buren aggressive. Indeed, they had little in
common save their rare mental and social gifts, and that personal
magnetism which binds followers with hooks of steel. But they stood
now at the head of their respective factions. When Van Buren,
therefore, finally consented to join Seymour in a division of the
spoils, the two wings of the party quickly coalesced in the fall of
1849 for the election of seven state officers. The Free-soil faction
professed to retain its principles; and, by placing several
Abolitionists upon the ticket, nine-tenths of that party also joined
the combination. But the spirit of the Free-soiler was absent. The man
whose genius and whose eloquence had been the most potent factor in
discrediting the Hunkers now had no anti-slavery speeches to make and
no anti-slavery resolutions to present. John Van Buren's
identification with the great movement, which he prophesied would
stand so strong and work such wonders, was destined, after he had
avenged the insult to his father, to vanish like a breath. Nor did the
coalition of Hunkers, Barnburners, and Abolitionists prove so numerous
or so solid that it could sweep the State. It did, indeed, carry the
Assembly by two majority, and with the help of a portion of the
Anti-Renters, who refused to support their own ticket, it elected four
minor state officers; but the Whigs held the Senate, and, with
majorities ranging from fifteen hundred to five thousand, chose the
comptroller, the secretary of state, and the treasurer. Washington
Hunt, the popular Whig candidate for comptroller, led the ticket by
nearly six thousand, a triumph that was soon to bring him higher
honours.</p>

<p>The Whigs, however, were to have their day of trouble. The election of
Taylor and Fillmore had fired the Southern heart with zeal to defend
slavery. More than eighty members of Congress issued an address, drawn
by John C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.151" id="Page_ii.151">ii. 151</a></span> Calhoun, rebuking the agitation of the slavery question,
insisting upon their right to take slaves into the territories, and
complaining of the difficulty of recovering fugitives. The Virginia
Legislature affirmed that the adoption and attempted enforcement of
the Wilmot Proviso would be resisted to the last extremity, and that
the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia would be a direct
attack upon the institution of the Southern States. These resolutions
were indorsed by Democratic conventions, approved at public meetings,
and amplified by state legislatures. In Missouri, Tennessee, and
Kentucky the feeling quickly reached fever heat; in the cotton States
sentiment boldly favoured &quot;A Southern Confederacy.&quot; Sectional interest
melted party lines. &quot;The Southern Whigs want the great question
settled in such a manner as shall not humble and exasperate the
South,&quot; said the New York <i>Tribune</i>; &quot;the Southern Democrats want it
so settled as to conduce to the extension of the power and influence
of slavery.&quot;</p>

<p>In the midst of this intense southern feeling Henry Clay, from his
place in the United States Senate, introduced the historic resolutions
which bear his name, proposing an amicable adjustment of all questions
growing out of the subject of slavery. This series of compromises was
to admit California, establish territorial governments in the regions
acquired from Mexico without provision for or against slavery, pay the
debt and fix the western boundary of Texas, declare it inexpedient to
abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, deny the right of
Congress to obstruct the slave trade between States, and to enact a
more stringent fugitive slave law. It was in January, 1850, that Clay
opened the memorable debate upon these resolutions, which continued
eight months and included Webster's great speech of the 7th of March.
When the debate ended in September Zachary Taylor was dead, Millard
Fillmore was President, a new Cabinet had been appointed, slavery
remained undisturbed in the District of Columbia, Mexico and Utah had
become territories open to slave-holders, and a new fugitive slave
law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.152" id="Page_ii.152">ii. 152</a></span> bore the approval of the new Chief Executive. During these months
the whole country had been absorbed in events at Washington. Private
letters, newspapers, public meetings, and state legislatures echoed
the speeches of the three distinguished Senators who had long been in
the public eye, and who, it was asserted at the time, were closing
their life work in saving the Union.</p>

<p>In this discussion, Daniel S. Dickinson favoured compromise; William
H. Seward stood firmly for his anti-slavery convictions. The latter
spoke on the 11th of March. He opposed the fugitive slave law because
&quot;we cannot be true Christians or real freemen if we impose on another
a chain that we defy all human power to lay on ourselves;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> he
declared for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,
&quot;and if I shall be asked what I did to embellish the capital of my
country, I will point to her freemen and say&#8212;these are the monuments
of my munificence;&quot; he antagonised the right to take slaves into new
territories, affirming that the Constitution devoted the domain to
union, to justice, and to liberty. &quot;But there is a higher law than the
Constitution,&quot; he said, &quot;which regulates our authority over the
domain, and devotes it to the same noble purposes.&quot; In treating of
threats of disunion he looked with a prophet's eye fourteen years into
the future. That vision revealed border warfare, kindred converted
into enemies, onerous taxes, death on the field and in the hospital,
and conscription to maintain opposing forces. &quot;It will then appear
that the question of dissolving the Union is a complex question; that
it embraces the fearful issue whether the Union shall stand and
slavery be removed by gradual, voluntary effort, and with
compensation, or whether the Union shall be dissolved and civil war
ensue, bringing on violent but complete and immediate emancipation. We
are now arrived at that stage of our national progress when that
crisis can be foreseen&#8212;when we must foresee it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>A less fearless and determined nature must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.153" id="Page_ii.153">ii. 153</a></span> overwhelmed by
the criticism, the censure, and the insulting sneers which this speech
provoked. Southern feeling dominated the Senate chamber. Many northern
men, sincerely desirous of limiting slavery, preferred giving up the
Wilmot Proviso for the sake of peace. Thousands of Whigs regarded
dissent from Clay and Webster, their time-honoured leaders, as bold
and presumptuous. In reviewing Seward's speech, these people
pronounced it pernicious, unpatriotic, and wicked, especially since
&quot;the higher law&quot; theory, taken in connection with his criticism of the
fugitive slave law, implied that a humane and Christian people could
not or would not obey it. But the Auburn statesman resented nothing
and retracted nothing. &quot;With the single exception of the argument in
poor Freeman's case,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it is the only speech I ever made
that contains nothing I could afford to strike out or qualify.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>But Seward's speech did not influence votes. Clay's compromises passed
amidst the wildest outbursts of popular enthusiasm. They appealed to a
majority of both the great parties as a final settlement of the
slavery question. In New York and other cities throughout the State,
flags were hoisted, salutes fired, joy bells rung, illuminations
flamed at night, and speakers at mass-meetings congratulated their
fellow citizens upon the wisdom of a President and a Congress that had
happily averted the great peril of disunion.</p>

<p>These exhibitions of gratitude were engrossing the attention of the
people when the Whig state convention met at Utica on the 26th of
September, 1850. Immediately, the approval of Seward's course assumed
supreme importance. Unusual excitement had attended the selection of
delegates. The new administration became aggressive. No secret was
made of its purpose to crush Thurlow Weed; and when the convention
assembled, Hugh Maxwell, collector of the port of New York, and John
Young, sub-treasurer, were there to control it. A test vote for
temporary chairman disclosed sixty-eight Radicals and forty-one
Conservatives present, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.154" id="Page_ii.154">ii. 154</a></span> in the interest of harmony Francis Granger
became the permanent president.</p>

<p>Granger was a man of honour and a man of intellect, whose qualities of
fairness and fitness for public life have already been described. When
he entered Harrison's Cabinet in 1841, as postmaster-general, the
South classed him as an Abolitionist; when he left Congress in 1843,
in the fulness of his intellectual strength, his home at Canandaigua
became the centre of an admiring group of Whigs who preferred the lead
of Clay and the conservative policy of Webster. He now appeared as an
ally of President Fillmore. It was natural, perhaps, that in
appointing a committee on resolutions, Granger should give advantage
of numbers to his own faction, but the Radicals were amazed at the
questionable action of his committee. It delayed its report upon the
pretext of not being ready, and then, late in the evening, in the
absence of many delegates, presented what purported to be a unanimous
expression, in which Seward was left practically without mention. As
the delegates listened in profound silence the majority became
painfully aware that something was wanting, and, before action upon it
could be taken, they forced an adjournment by a vote of fifty-six to
fifty-one.</p>

<p>The next morning the Radicals exhibited a desire for less harmony and
more justice. By a vote of seventy-three to forty-six the original
resolutions were recommitted to an enlarged committee, and after
nominating Washington Hunt for governor and George J. Cornwell for
lieutenant-governor, substitute resolutions were adopted by a vote of
seventy-four to forty-two. One difference between the original and the
substitute centred in the organisation of new territories. The
majority opposed any surrender or waiver of the exclusion of slavery
in any act establishing a regular civil organisation; the minority
thought that, since it was impossible to secure the Wilmot Proviso, an
insistence upon which would prevent any territorial organisation, it
would be better to organise them without it, relying upon nature and
the known disposition of the inhabitants to follow the lead of
Cali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.155" id="Page_ii.155">ii. 155</a></span>fornia. This difference, however, could probably have been healed
had the Radicals not insisted that &quot;the thanks of the Whig party are
especially due to William H. Seward for the signal ability and
fidelity with which he sustained those beloved principles of public
policy so long cherished by the Whigs of the Empire State, expressed
in state and county conventions as well as in the votes and
instructions of the state legislature.&quot; Upon this resolution the
Conservatives demanded a roll call, and when its adoption, by the
surprising vote of seventy-five to forty, was announced, the minority,
amidst the wildest excitement, left the hall in a body, followed by
Francis Granger, whose silver gray hair gave a name to the seceders.
Their withdrawal was not a surprise. Like the secession of the
Barnburners three years before, loud threats preceded action. Indeed,
William A. Duer, the Oswego congressman, admitted travelling from
Washington to Syracuse with instructions from Fillmore to bolt the
approval of Seward. But the secession seemed to disturb only the
Silver-Grays themselves, who now drafted an address to the Whigs of
the State and called a new convention to assemble at Utica on October
17.</p>

<p>The Democrats in their state convention, which met at Syracuse on
September 11, repeated the policy of conciliation so skilfully
engineered in 1849 by Horatio Seymour. They received Barnburner
delegates, they divided the offices, and they allowed John Van Buren
to rule. It mattered not what were the principles of the captivating
Prince and his followers so long as they accepted &quot;the recent
settlement by Congress of questions which have unhappily divided the
people of these States.&quot; Thus the Free-soil Barnburners disappeared as
a political factor. Some of them continued to avow their anti-slavery
principles, but no one had the temerity to mention them in convention.
Men deemed it politic and prudent to affect to believe that the
slavery question, which had threatened to disturb the national peace,
was finally laid at rest. The country so accepted it, trade and
commerce demanded it, and old political leaders conceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.156" id="Page_ii.156">ii. 156</a></span> it. In this
frame of mind, delegates found it easy to nominate Horatio Seymour for
governor and Sanford E. Church for lieutenant-governor. The next day
the Abolitionists, tired of their union with Hunkers and Barnburners,
nominated William L. Chaplin and Joseph Plumb.</p>

<p>The convention of the Silver-Grays, held at Utica in October, did not
exalt its members. It was simply a protest. A lion-hearted man had
presumed to voice his convictions, and, although the convention
favoured exercising a liberal spirit of toleration toward the
compromise measures, it refused to exercise such a spirit toward
William H. Seward, or to tolerate him at all. It gave the President a
flattering indorsement for his approval of the fugitive slave law, it
accepted Washington Hunt as its nominee for governor, and it listened
to several addresses, among them one from James O. Putnam of Buffalo;
but the proceedings lacked the enthusiasm that springs from a clear
principle, backed by a strong and resolute band of followers. The
speech of Putnam, however, attracted wide attention. Putnam was a
young man then, less than thirty-three years old, passionately devoted
to Daniel Webster, and a personal friend of Millard Fillmore. As a
speaker he was polished, smooth, and refined, and even when
impassioned kept his passion well within conventional bounds. On this
occasion his mellow and far-reaching voice, keyed to the pitch of
sustained rhetoric, dropped his well-balanced and finely moulded
sentences into the convention amidst hearty applause. He did not then
see with the clearness of Seward's vision. He belonged rather to the
more enlightened and intelligent conservatives who had begun to feel
the ultimate disaster slavery must bring, and who desired that such
disaster should be put off as long as possible; but the day was soon
to dawn in which he would become a loyal supporter of the principles
that were to be forever settled in the civil strife which Seward so
vividly portrayed in the speech that created the Silver-Grays.</p>

<p>The recently adopted compromise did not become an issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.157" id="Page_ii.157">ii. 157</a></span> in the New
York campaign of 1850. If its opponents could not approve, they deemed
silence wise. The followers of Fillmore in the up-state counties
generally acted with the Seward men in support of Washington Hunt; but
a great meeting, held at Castle Garden, near the close of the
campaign, partially succeeded in uniting Democrats and Administration
Whigs in New York City. A letter was read from Daniel Webster, calling
upon all good citizens not to rekindle the flames of &quot;useless and
dangerous controversy;&quot; resolutions favouring a vigorous enforcement
of the fugitive slave law were adopted; and a coalition ticket with
Seymour at its head was agreed upon. This meeting, called a great
popular protest against demagoguery, opened an aggressive canvass to
defeat Hunt and destroy the Syracuse indorsement of Seward by raising
the cry that Seward Whigs preferred civil war to a peaceable
enforcement of the fugitive slave law. Seward took no part in this
campaign. After Congress adjourned on the last day of September, he
devoted the short time between the sessions to his law business. His
friends, however, were active. Weed attacked the Castle Garden meeting
with a bitterness and vigour rarely disclosed in the columns of the
<i>Evening Journal</i>, and Greeley poured one broadside after another into
what he regarded as the miserable mismanagement, blundering, and
confusion of the Administration.</p>

<p>While waiting the result of the election, people were startled into
sadness by the sudden death of Samuel Young at the age of seventy-two.
He had retired in usual health, but died during the night. His
distinguished career, covering nearly two-score years, was
characterised by strong prejudices, violent temper, and implacable
resentments, which, kept him behind men of less aptitude for public
service; but he was always a central figure in any assemblage favoured
with his presence. He had a marvellous force of oratory. His, voice,
his gestures, his solemn pauses, followed by lofty and sustained
declamation, proved irresistible and sometimes overwhelming in their
effect. But it was his misfortune to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.158" id="Page_ii.158">ii. 158</a></span> be an orator with jaundiced
vision, who seemed not always to see that principles controlled
oftener than rhetoric. Yet, he willingly walked on in his own wild,
stormy way, apparently enjoying the excitement with no fear of danger.
&quot;In his heart there was no guile,&quot; said Horace Greeley; &quot;in his face
no dough.&quot;</p>

<p>It was several weeks after the election, before it was ascertained
whether Seymour or Hunt had been chosen. Both were popular, and of
about the same age. Washington Hunt seems to have devoted his life to
an earnest endeavour to win everybody's good will. At this time
Greeley thought him &quot;capable without pretension,&quot; and &quot;animated by an
anxious desire to win golden opinions by deserving them.&quot; He had been
six years in Congress, and, in 1849, ran far ahead of his ticket as
comptroller. Horatio Seymour was no less successful in winning
approbation. He had become involved in the canal controversy, but
carefully avoided the slavery question. Greeley found it in his heart
to speak of him as &quot;an able and agreeable lawyer of good fortune and
competent speaking talent, who would make a highly respectable
governor.&quot; But 1850 was not Seymour's year. His associates upon the
ticket were elected by several thousand majority, and day after day
his own success seemed probable. The New York City combine gave him a
satisfactory majority; in two or three Hudson river counties he made
large gains; but the official count gave Hunt two hundred and
sixty-two plurality,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> with a safe Whig majority in the
Legislature. The Whigs also elected a majority of the congressmen.
&quot;These results,&quot; wrote Thurlow Weed, &quot;will encourage the friends of
freedom to persevere by all constitutional means and through all
rightful channels in their efforts to restrain the extension of
slavery, and to wipe out that black spot wherever it can be done
without injury to the rights and interests of others.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

1850-1852</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Assembly of 1851 has a peculiar, almost romantic interest for New
Yorkers. A very young man, full of promise and full of performance,
the brilliant editor of a later day, the precocious politician of that
day, became its speaker. Henry Jarvis Raymond was then in his
thirty-first year. New York City had sent him to the Assembly in 1850,
and he leaped into prominence the week he took his seat. He was ready
in debate, temperate in language, quick in the apprehension of
parliamentary rules, and of phenomenal tact. The unexcelled courtesy
and grace of manner with which he dropped the measured and beautiful
sentences that made him an orator, undoubtedly aided in obtaining the
position to which his genius entitled him. But his political
instincts, also, were admirable, and his aptness as an unerring
counsellor in the conduct of complicated affairs always turned to the
advantage of his party. There came a time, after the assassination of
President Lincoln, when he made a mistake so grievous that he was
never able to regain his former standing; when he was dropped from the
list of party leaders; when his cordial affiliation with members of
the Republican organisation ceased; when his removal from the
chairmanship of the National Committee was ratified by the action of a
state convention; but the sagacity with which he now commented upon
what he saw and heard made the oldest members of the Assembly lean
upon him. And when he came back to the Legislature in January, 1851,
they put him in the speaker's chair.</p>

<p>Raymond seems never to have wearied of study, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.160" id="Page_ii.160">ii. 160</a></span> have found it
difficult easily to acquire knowledge. He could read at three years of
age; at five he was a speaker. In his sixteenth year he taught school
in Genesee County, where he was born, wrote a Fourth of July ode
creditable to one of double his years, and entered the University of
Vermont. As soon as he reached an age to appreciate his tastes and to
form a purpose, he began equipping himself for the career of a
political journalist. He was not yet twenty-one when he made Whig
speeches in the campaign of 1840 and gained employment with Horace
Greeley on the <i>New Yorker</i> and a little later on the <i>Tribune</i>. &quot;I
never found another person, barely of age and just from his studies,
who evinced so much and so versatile ability in journalism as he did,&quot;
wrote Greeley. &quot;Abler and stronger men I may have met; a cleverer,
readier, more generally efficient journalist I never saw. He is the
only assistant with whom I ever felt required to remonstrate for doing
more work than any human brain and frame could be expected long to
endure. His services were more valuable in proportion to their cost
than those of any one who ever worked on the <i>Tribune</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In 1843,
when Raymond left the <i>Tribune</i>, James Watson Webb, already acquainted
with the ripe intelligence and eager genius of the young man of
twenty-three, thought him competent to manage the <i>Courier and
Enquirer</i>, and in his celebrated discussion with Greeley on the
subject of socialism he gave that paper something of the glory which
twelve years later crowned his labours upon the New York <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that Raymond should hold office. The readiness with
which he formulated answers to arguments in the Polk campaign, his
sympathy with the Free-soil movement, the canal policy, and the common
school system, produced a marked impression upon the dawning wisdom of
his readers. But it was near the end of his connection with the
<i>Courier</i> before he yielded his own desires to the urgent solicitation
of the Whigs of the ninth ward and went to the Assembly. He had not
yet quarrelled with James Watson Webb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.161" id="Page_ii.161">ii. 161</a></span> That came in the spring of
1851 when he refused to use his political influence as speaker against
Hamilton Fish for United States senator and in favour of the owner of
the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>. His anti-slavery convictions and strong
prejudices against the compromise measures of 1850 also rapidly
widened the gulf between him and his superior; and when the break
finally came he stepped from the speaker's chair into the editorial
management of the New York <i>Times</i>, his own paper, pure in tone and
reasonable in price, which was destined to weaken the <i>Courier</i> as a
political organ, to rival the <i>Tribune</i> as a family and party journal,
and to challenge the <i>Herald</i> as a collector of news.</p>

<p>The stormy sessions of the Legislature of 1851 needed such a speaker
as Raymond. At the outset, the scenes and tactics witnessed at
Seward's election to the Senate in 1849 were repeated in the selection
of a successor to Daniel S. Dickinson, whose term expired on the 4th
of March. Webb's candidacy was prosecuted with characteristic zeal.
For a quarter of a century he had been a picturesque, aggressive
journalist, with a record adorned with libel suits and duels&#8212;the
result of pungent paragraphs and bitter personalities&#8212;making him an
object of terror to the timid and a pistol target for the fearless. On
one occasion, through the clemency of Governor Seward, he escaped a
two years' term in state's prison for fighting the brilliant &quot;Tom&quot;
Marshall of Kentucky, who wounded him in the leg, and it is not
impossible that Jonathan Cilley might have wounded him in the other
had not the distinguished Maine congressman refused his challenge
because he was &quot;not a gentleman.&quot; This reply led to the foolish and
fatal fray between Cilley and William J. Graves, who took up Webb's
quarrel.</p>

<p>Webb was known as the Apollo of the press, his huge form, erect and
massive, towering above the heads of other men, while his great
physical strength made him noted for feats of endurance and activity.
As a young man he held a minor commission in the army, but in 1827, at
the age of twenty-five, he resigned to become the editor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.162" id="Page_ii.162">ii. 162</a></span>
<i>Courier</i>, which, in 1829, he combined with the <i>Enquirer</i>. For twenty
years, under his management, this paper, first as a supporter of
Jackson and later as an advocate of Whig policies, ranked among the
influential journals of New York. After Raymond withdrew, however, it
became the organ of the Silver-Grays, and began to wane, until, in
1860, it lapsed into the <i>World</i>.</p>

<p>Webb's chief title to distinction in political life was allegiance to
his own principles regardless of the party with which he happened to
be affiliated, and his fidelity to men who had shown him kindness. He
followed President Jackson until the latter turned against the United
States Bank, and he supported the radical Whigs until Clay, in 1849,
defeated his confirmation for minister to Austria; but, to the last,
he seems to have remained true to Seward, possibly because Seward kept
him out of state's prison, although, in the contest for United States
senator in 1851, Hamilton Fish was the candidate of the Seward Whigs.
Fish had grown rapidly as governor. People formerly recognised him as
an accomplished gentleman, modest in manners and moderate in speech,
but his conduct and messages as an executive revealed those higher
qualities of statesmanship that ranked him among the wisest public men
of the State. Thurlow Weed had accepted rather than selected him for
governor in 1848. &quot;I came here without claims upon your kindness,&quot;
Fish wrote on December 31, 1850, the last day of his term. &quot;I shall
leave here full of the most grateful recollections of your favours and
good will.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This admission was sufficient to dishonour him with
the Fillmore Whigs, and, although he became the caucus nominee for
senator on the 30th of January, his opponents, marshalled by Fillmore
office-holders in support of James Watson Webb, succeeded in
deadlocking his election for nearly two months.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.163" id="Page_ii.163">ii. 163</a></span></p><p>In the meantime, other serious troubles confronted the young speaker.
The Assembly, pursuant to the recommendation of Governor Hunt, passed
an act authorising a loan of nine million dollars for the immediate
enlargement of the Erie canal. Its constitutionality, seriously
doubted, was approved by Daniel Webster and Rufus Choate, and the
Whigs, needing an issue for the campaign, forced the bill ahead until
eleven Democratic senators broke a quorum by resigning their seats.
The Whigs were scarcely less excited than the Democrats. Such a
secession had never occurred before. Former legislators held the
opinion that they were elected to represent and maintain the interests
of their constituents&#8212;not to withdraw for the sake of indulging some
petulant or romantic impulse because they could not have their own
way. Two opposition senators had the good sense to take this view and
remain at their post. Governor Hunt immediately called an extra
session, and, in the campaign to fill the vacancies, six of the eleven
seceders were beaten. Thus reinforced in the Senate, the Whig policy
became the law; and, although, the Court of Appeals, in the following
May, held the act unconstitutional, both parties got the benefit of
the issue in the campaign of 1851.</p>

<p>In this contest the Whigs followed the lead of the Democrats in
avoiding the slavery question. The fugitive slave law was absorbing
public attention. The &quot;Jerry rescue&quot; had not occurred in Syracuse; nor
had the killing of a slave-holder in a negro uprising on the border of
an adjoining State adver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.164" id="Page_ii.164">ii. 164</a></span>tised the danger of enforcing the law; yet
the Act had not worked as smoothly as Fillmore's friends wished. It
took ten days of litigation at a cost of more than the fugitive's
value to reclaim a slave in New York City. Trustworthy estimates fixed
the number of runaways in the free States at fifteen thousand, and a
southern United States senator bitterly complained that only four or
five had been recaptured since the law's enactment. Enough had been
done, however, to inflame the people into a passion. Ralph Waldo
Emerson declared the Act &quot;a law which every one of you will break on
the earliest occasion&#8212;a law which no man can obey, or abet the
obeying, without loss of self-respect and forfeiture of the name of
gentleman.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Seward did not hesitate to publish similar
sentiments. &quot;Christendom,&quot; he wrote, &quot;might be searched in vain for a
parallel to the provisions which make escape from bondage a crime, and
which, under vigorous penalties, compel freemen to aid in the capture
of slaves.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The Albany <i>Evening Journal</i> declared that &quot;the
execution of the fugitive slave law violently convulses the
foundations of society. Fugitives who have lived among us for many
years cannot be seized and driven off as if they belonged to the brute
creation. The attempt to recover such fugitives will prove
abortive.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to read these expressions without believing that they
were written under the inspiration of genuine emotion, and that so
long as such conditions continued men of sentiment could think of
little else. Danger to the Union, at least assumed danger, could not
in any way soften their hearts or change their purposes. Yet the state
conventions which met in Syracuse on September 10 and 11, 1851, talked
of other things. The Democrats nominated a ticket divided between
Hunkers and Barnburners; and, after condemning the Whig management of
the canals as lavish, reckless, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.165" id="Page_ii.165">ii. 165</a></span> corrupt, readopted the slavery
resolutions of the previous year. The Whigs likewise performed their
duty by making up a ticket of Fillmore and inoffensive Seward men,
pledging the party to the enlargement of the Erie canal. Thus it was
publicly announced that slavery should be eliminated from the thought
and action of parties.</p>

<p>This policy of silence put the Whigs under painful restraint. The
rescue of a fugitive at Syracuse by a band of resolute men, led by
Gerrit Smith and Samuel J. May, and the killing of a slave-owner at
Christiana, Pennsylvania, while attempting to reclaim his property,
seriously disturbed the consciences of men who thought as did Emerson
and Seward; but not a word appeared in Whig papers about the great
underlying question which persistently forced itself on men's
thoughts. Greeley wrote of the tariff and the iron trade; Seward spent
the summer in Detroit on professional engagements; and Weed, whose
great skill had aided in successfully guiding the canal loan through a
legislative secession, continued to urge that policy as the key to the
campaign as well as to New York's commerce. But after the votes were
counted the Whigs discovered that they had played a losing game. Two
minor state officers out of eight, with a tie in the Senate and two
majority in the Assembly, summed up their possessions. The defeat of
George W. Patterson for comptroller greatly distressed his friends,
and the loss of the canal board, with all its officers, plunged the
whole Whig party into grief. Several reasons for this unexpected
result found advocates in the press. There were evidences of
infidelity in some of the up-state counties, especially in the Auburn
district, where Samuel Blatchford's law partnership with Seward had
defeated him for justice of the Supreme Court; but the wholesale
proscription in New York City by Administration or &quot;Cotton Whigs,&quot; as
they were called, fully accounted for the overthrow. It was taken as a
declaration of war against Sewardism. &quot;The majorities against
Patterson and his defeated associates,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, in its
issue of November 20, &quot;imply that no man who is recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.166" id="Page_ii.166">ii. 166</a></span> as a
friend of Governor Seward and a condemner of the fugitive slave law
must be run on our state ticket hereafter, or he will be beaten by the
Cotton influence in this city.&quot; Hamilton Fish took a similar view. &quot;A
noble, glorious party has been defeated&#8212;destroyed&#8212;by its own
leaders,&quot; he wrote Weed. &quot;Webster has succeeded better under Fillmore
than he did under Tyler in breaking up the Whig organisation and
forming a third party. I pity Fillmore. Timid, vacillating, credulous,
unjustly suspicious when approached by his prejudices, he has allowed
the sacrifice of that confiding party which has had no honours too
high to confer upon him. It cannot be long before he will realise the
tremendous mistake he has made.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>What Hamilton Fish said the great majority of New York Whigs thought,
and in this frame of mind they entered the presidential campaign of
1852. Fillmore, Scott, and Webster were the candidates. Fillmore had
not spared the use of patronage to further his ambition. It mattered
not that the postmaster at Albany was the personal friend of Thurlow
Weed, or that the men appointed upon the recommendation of Seward were
the choice of a majority of their party, the proscription extended to
all who disapproved the Silver-Grays' bolt of 1850, or refused to
recognise their subsequent convention at Utica. Under these
circumstances thirst for revenge as well as a desire to nominate a
winning candidate controlled the selection of presidential delegates;
and in the round-up seven favoured Fillmore, two preferred Webster,
while twenty-four supported Scott. Naturally the result was a great
shock to Fillmore. The Silver-Grays had been growing heartily sick of
their secession, and if they needed further evidence of its rashness
the weakness of their leader in his home State furnished it.</p>

<p>Fillmore's strength proved to be chiefly in the South. His vigorous
execution of the fugitive slave law had been more potent than his
unsparing use of patronage; and when the Whig convention assembled at
Baltimore on June 16 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.167" id="Page_ii.167">ii. 167</a></span> question whether that law should be declared
a finality became of supreme importance. Fillmore could not stand on
an anti-slavery platform, and a majority of the New Yorkers refused
their consent to any sacrifice of principle. But, in spite of their
protest, the influence of a solid southern delegation, backed by the
marvellous eloquence of Rufus Choate, forced the passage of a
resolution declaring that &quot;the compromise acts, the act known as the
fugitive slave law included, are received and acquiesced in by the
Whig party of the United States as a settlement in principle and
substance of the dangerous and exciting questions which they embrace.
We insist upon their strict enforcement; and we deprecate all further
agitation of the question thus settled, as dangerous to our peace, and
will discountenance all efforts to continue or renew such agitation
whenever, wherever, or however the attempt may be made.&quot; A roll call
developed sixty-six votes in the negative, all from the North, and
one-third of them from New York.</p>

<p>This was a Fillmore-Webster platform, and the first ballot gave them a
majority of the votes cast, Fillmore having 133, Webster 29, Scott
131. The number necessary to a choice was 147. The activity of the
Fillmore delegates, therefore, centred in an effort to concentrate the
votes of the President and his secretary of state. Both were in
Washington, their relations were cordial, and an adjournment of the
convention over Sunday gave abundant opportunity to negotiate. When it
became manifest that Webster's friends would not go to Fillmore, an
extraordinary effort was made to bring the President's votes to
Webster. This was agreeable to Fillmore, who placed a letter of
withdrawal in the hands of a Buffalo delegate to be used whenever he
deemed it proper. But twenty-two Southern men declined to be
transferred, while the most piteous appeals to the Scott men of New
York met with cold refusals. They professed any amount of duty to
their party, but as regards the Fillmore combine they were implacable.
They would listen to no terms of compromise while their great enemy
remained in the field. Mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.168" id="Page_ii.168">ii. 168</a></span>time, the Scott managers had not been
asleep. In the contest over the platform, certain Southern delegates
had agreed to vote for Scott whenever Fillmore reached his finish,
provided Scott's friends supported the fugitive slave plank; and these
delegates, amidst the wildest excitement, now began changing their
votes to the hero of Lundy's Lane. On the fifty-third ballot, the
soldier had twenty-six majority, the vote standing: Scott, 159;
Fillmore, 112; Webster, 21.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Hamilton Fish was fulfilled. Fillmore now realised, if
never before, &quot;the tremendous mistakes he had made.&quot; Upon his election
as Vice President, and especially after dreams of the White House
began to dazzle him, he seemed to sacrifice old friends and cherished
principles without a scruple. Until then, the Buffalo statesman had
been as pronounced upon the slavery question as Seward; and after he
became President, with the tremendous influence of Daniel Webster
driving him on, it was not believed that he would violate the
principles of a lifetime by approving a fugitive slave law, revolting
to the rapidly growing sentiment of justice and humanity toward the
slave. But, unlike Webster, the President manifested no feeling of
chagrin or disappointment over the result at Baltimore. Throughout the
campaign and during the balance of his term of office he bore himself
with courage and with dignity. Indeed, his equanimity seemed almost
like the fortitude of fatalism. No doubt, he was sustained by the
conviction that the compromise measures had avoided civil war, and by
the feeling that if he had erred, Clay and Webster had likewise erred;
but he could have had no presentiment of the depth of the retirement
to which he was destined. He was to reappear, in 1856, as a
presidential candidate of the Americans; and, after civil war had rent
the country in twain, his sympathy for the Union was to reveal itself
early and with ardour. But the fugitive slave law, which, next to
treason itself, had become the most offensive act during the ante-war
crisis, filled the minds of men with a growing dislike of the one
whose pen gave it life, and, in spite of his high character, his long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.169" id="Page_ii.169">ii. 169</a></span>
public career, and his eminence as a citizen, he was associated with
Pierce and Buchanan, who, as Northern men, were believed to have
surrendered to Southern dictation.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>In the national convention at Baltimore, which met June 1, 1852, the
New York Democrats were likewise destined to suffer by their
divisions. Lewis Cass, James Buchanan, and Stephen A. Douglas were the
leading candidates; though William L. Marcy and Daniel S. Dickinson
also had presidential ambitions. Marcy was a man of different mould
from Dickinson.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> With great mental resources, rare administrative
ability, consummate capacity in undermining enemies, and an intuitive
sagacity in the selection of friends, Marcy was an opponent to be
dreaded. After the experiences of 1847 and 1848, he had bitterly
denounced the Barnburners, refusing even to join Seymour in 1849 in
his heroic efforts to reunite the party; but when the Barnburners,
influenced by the Utica statesman, began talking of him for President
in 1852 he quickly put himself in accord with that wing of his party.
Instantly, this became a call to battle. The Hunkers, provoked at his
apostacy and encouraged by the continued distrust of many Barnburners,
made a desperate ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.170" id="Page_ii.170">ii. 170</a></span>fort, under the leadership of Dickinson, to secure
a majority of the delegates for Cass. The plastic hand of Horatio
Seymour, however, quickly kneaded the doubting Barnburners into Marcy
advocates; and when the contest ended the New York delegation stood
twenty-three for Marcy and thirteen for Cass.</p>

<p>Dickinson, who had been a steadfast friend of the South, relied with
confidence upon Virginia and other Southern States whenever success
with Cass seemed impossible. On the other hand, Marcy expected a
transfer of support from Buchanan and Douglas if the break came. On
the first ballot Cass had 116, Buchanan 93, Douglas 20, and Marcy 27;
necessary to a choice, 188. As chairman of the New York delegation,
Horatio Seymour held Marcy's vote practically intact through
thirty-three ballots; but, on the thirty-fourth, he dropped to 23, and
Virginia cast its fifteen votes for Dickinson, who, up to that time,
had been honoured only with the vote of a solitary delegate. In the
midst of some applause, the New Yorker, who was himself a delegate,
thanked his Virginia friends for the compliment, but declared that his
adherence to Cass could not be shaken.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Dickinson had carefully
arranged for this vote. The day before, in the presence of the
Virginia delegation, he had asked Henry B. Stanton's opinion of his
ability to carry New York. &quot;You or Marcy or any man nominated can
carry New York,&quot; was the laconic reply. Dickinson followed Stanton out
of the room to thank him for his courtesy, but regretted he did not
confine his answer to him alone. After Virginia's vote Dickinson again
sought Stanton's opinion as to its adherence. &quot;It is simply a
compliment,&quot; was the reply, &quot;and will leave you on the next ballot,&quot;
which it did, going to Franklin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.171" id="Page_ii.171">ii. 171</a></span> Pierce. &quot;Dickinson's friends used to
assert,&quot; continued Stanton, &quot;that he threw away the Presidency on this
occasion. I happened to know better. He never stood for a moment where
he could control the Virginia vote&#8212;the hinge whereon all was to
turn.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime Marcy moved up to 44. It had been evident for two days
that the favourite candidates could not win, and for the next thirteen
ballots, amidst the greatest noise and confusion, the convention
sought to discover the wisest course to pursue. Seymour endeavoured to
side-track the &quot;dark horse&quot; movement by turning the tide to Marcy,
whose vote kept steadily rising. When, on the forty-fifth ballot, he
reached 97, the New York delegation retired for consultation. Seymour
at once moved that the State vote solidly for Marcy; but protests fell
so thick, exploding like bombshells, that he soon withdrew the motion.
This ended Marcy's chances.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> On the forty-ninth ballot, North
Carolina started the stampede to Pierce, who received 282 votes to 6
for all others. Later in the day, the convention nominated William R.
King of Alabama for Vice President, and adopted a platform, declaring
that &quot;the Democratic party of the Union will abide by, and adhere to,
a faithful execution of the acts known as the compromise measures
settled by the last Congress&#8212;the act for reclaiming fugitive slaves
from service of labour included; which act, being designed to carry
out an express provision of the Constitution, cannot with fidelity
thereto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.172" id="Page_ii.172">ii. 172</a></span> be repealed, nor so changed as to destroy or impair its
efficiency.&quot;</p>

<p>Some time before the convention it was suggested, with Marcy's
approval, that the New York delegation should vote as a unit for
Dickinson if he proved the stronger candidate outside the State, and,
upon the same condition, a solid delegation should vote for Marcy.
This proposition did not reach Dickinson until his leading friends had
committed themselves by a second choice; but, in speaking of the
matter to Thurlow Weed ten years afterward, Dickinson said that had it
come in time he would cheerfully have accepted it, adding that
whatever may have been his opinion in 1852, he now knew it would have
resulted in Marcy's nomination.</p>

<p>The disturbance among the New York delegates at Baltimore had its
influence at Syracuse when the Democratic state convention assembled
on September 1. Seymour was the leading candidate for governor, and
Dickinson opposed him with a bitterness born of a desire for revenge.
The night before the convention Seymour's chances were pronounced
desperate. Whatever disappointments had come at Baltimore were laid at
his door. Seymour made Cass' defeat possible; Seymour refused to help
Buchanan; Seymour was responsible for a dark horse; Seymour filled
Marcy's friends with hopes of ultimate victory, only to heighten their
disappointment in the end. All these allegations were merely founded
upon his steadfastness to Marcy, and he might have answered that
everything had been done with the approval of a majority of the New
York delegation. But Dickinson was no match for the Utica statesman.
Seymour's whole life had been a training for such a contest. As Roscoe
Conkling said of him many years later, he had sat at the feet of Edwin
Croswell and measured swords with Thurlow Weed. He was one of the men
who do not lose the character of good fighters because they are
excellent negotiators. Even the cool-headed and astute John Van Buren,
who joined Dickinson in his support of John P. Beekman of New York
City for governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.173" id="Page_ii.173">ii. 173</a></span> found that Seymour could cut deeply when he chose
to wield a blade.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Seymour, moreover, gave his friends great
satisfaction by the energy with which he entered the gubernatorial
contest. When the first ballot was announced he had 59 votes to
Beekman's 7, with only 64 necessary to a choice. On the second ballot,
the Utican had 78 and Beekman 3. This concluded the convention's
contest. Sanford E. Church was then renominated for
lieutenant-governor, and the Baltimore platform approved.</p>

<p>The Whig state convention met at Syracuse on September 22 and promptly
renominated Washington Hunt for governor by acclamation. Raymond
wanted it, and Greeley, in a letter to Weed, admitted an ambition,
while a strong sentiment existed for George W. Patterson. Hunt had
veered toward Fillmore's way of thinking. &quot;The closing paragraphs of
his message are a beggarly petition to the South,&quot; wrote George
Dawson, the quaint, forceful associate of Weed upon the <i>Evening
Journal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> But Hunt's administration had been quiet and
satisfactory, and there was little disposition to drop him. He did not
have the patience of Hamilton Fish, but he resembled him in moderation
of speech.</p>

<p>William Kent, a son of the Chancellor, received the nomination for
lieutenant-governor. Kent was a scholarly, able lawyer. He had served
five years upon the circuit bench by appointment of Governor Seward.
He co-operated with Benjamin F. Butler in the organisation of the law
school of the New York University, becoming one of its original
lecturers, and was subsequently called to Harvard as a professor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.174" id="Page_ii.174">ii. 174</a></span>
law. Like his distinguished father he was a man of pure character, and
of singular simplicity and gentleness.</p>

<p>The adoption of a platform gave the Whig delegates more trouble than
the nomination of candidates. A large majority opposed the slavery
plank of the Baltimore platform. But the Seward Whigs, having little
faith in the ultimate result, accepted a general declaration that &quot;an
honest acquiescence in the action of the late national convention upon
all subjects legitimately before it is the duty of every Whig.&quot; Horace
Greeley suggested that &quot;those who please can construe this concession
into an approval.&quot;</p>

<p>In opening the canvass of 1852, the Whigs attempted to repeat the
campaign of 1840. Scott's record in the War of 1812 was not less
brilliant than Harrison's, and if his Mexican battles were not fought
against the overwhelming odds that Taylor met at Buena Vista, he was
none the less entitled to the distinction of a conqueror. It was
thought proper, therefore, to start his political campaign where his
military career began, and, as the anniversary of Lundy's Lane
occurred in July, extensive preparations were made for celebrating the
day at Niagara Falls, the nearest American point to the scene of his
desperate courage. The great meeting, made up of large delegations
from nearly every Northern State, rivalled in numbers and in
enthusiasm the memorable meetings of the Harrison campaign. To add to
the interest, two hundred and twenty officers and soldiers of the War
of 1812, some of whom had taken part in the battle, participated in
the festivities. Speakers declared that it inaugurated a new career of
triumph, which might be likened to the onslaught of Lundy's Lane, the
conflict of Chippewa, the siege of Vera Cruz, and the storm of Cerro
Gordo; and which, they prophesied, would end in triumphant possession,
not now of the Halls of the Montezumas, but of the White House of
American Presidents. The meeting lasted two days. Thomas Ewing, of
Ohio, acted as president, and among the speakers was Henry Winter
Davis.</p>

<p>But this was the only demonstration that recalled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.175" id="Page_ii.175">ii. 175</a></span> Harrison
campaign. The drum and cannon did conspicuous work, flags floated, and
speakers found ready and patriotic listeners, but the hearts of many
people were not enlisted in the discussion of tariffs and public
improvements. They were thinking of the fugitive slave law and its
enforcement, and some believed that while speakers and editors were
charging Pierce with cowardice on the field of Churubusco they did not
themselves have the courage to voice their honest convictions on the
slavery question. As election drew near signs of victory disappeared.
Conservative Whigs did not like the candidate and anti-slavery Whigs
objected to the platform. &quot;This wretched platform,&quot; Seward declared,
&quot;was contrived to defeat Scott in the nomination, or to sink him in
the canvass.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Horace Greeley's spirited protest against the
fugitive slave plank gave rise to the phrase, &quot;We accept the
candidate, but spit upon the platform.&quot; Among the business men of New
York City an impression obtained that if Scott became President,
Seward would control him; and their purpose to crush the soldier
seemed to centre not so much in hostility to Scott as in their desire
to destroy Seward. Greeley speaks of this &quot;extraordinary feature&quot; of
the campaign. &quot;Seward has been the burden of our adversaries' song
from the outset,&quot; he writes; &quot;and mercantile Whigs by thousands have
ever been ready not merely to defeat but to annihilate the Whig party
if they might thereby demolish Seward.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In answer to the charge
of influencing Scott's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.176" id="Page_ii.176">ii. 176</a></span> administration, the Senator promptly declared
that he would neither ask nor accept &quot;any public station or preferment
whatever at the hands of the President.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But this in nowise
silenced their batteries. To the end of the canvass Scott continued to
be advertised as the &quot;Seward candidate.&quot;</p>

<p>After the September elections, it became manifest that something must
be done to strengthen Whig sentiment, and Scott made a trip through
the doubtful States of Ohio and New York. Although Harrison had made
several speeches in 1840, there was no precedent for a presidential
stumping tour; and, to veil the purpose of the journey, recourse was
had to a statute authorising the general of the army to visit Kentucky
with the object of locating an asylum for sick and disabled soldiers
at Blue Lick Springs. He went from Washington by way of Pittsburg and
returned through New York, stopping at Buffalo, Niagara Falls,
Lockport, Rochester, Auburn, Syracuse, Rome, Utica, and Albany.
Everywhere great crowds met him, but cheers for the hero mingled with
cheers for a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana,
indicating the certain election of Pierce in November. At Auburn,
Seward referred to him as &quot;the greatest of American heroes since the
Revolutionary age.&quot; At Albany, John C. Spencer's presence recalled the
distinguished services of Governor Tompkins and Chief Justice Ambrose
Spencer in the War of 1812. &quot;It was these men,&quot; said Scott, &quot;who were
aware of the position on the frontier, that urged me on to achieve
something that would add to the future honour of our country.&quot; New
York City received him with one of the largest ovations ever witnessed
up to that time. He avoided politics in his speeches, insisting that
he did not come to solicit votes. But he did not thereby help his
cause or escape ridicule. Indeed, the ill-advised things said and
done, created the impression that obtained thirty-two years later
after the tour of James G. Blaine.</p>

<p>Though the Democrats at first accepted Franklin Pierce as they had
received James K. Polk, coldness and distrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.177" id="Page_ii.177">ii. 177</a></span> gradually disappeared.
At Tammany's Fourth of July celebration, the presence of the prominent
leaders who bolted in 1848 gave evidence of the party's reunion. The
chief speaker was John Van Buren. Upon the platform sat John A. Dix,
Preston King, and Churchill C. Cambreling. Of the letters read, one
came from Martin Van Buren, who expressed pleasure that &quot;the
disturbing subject of slavery has, by the action of both the great
parties of the country, been withdrawn from the canvass.&quot; Among the
editors who contributed most powerfully to the Free-soil movement,
William Cullen Bryant now supported Pierce on the theory that he and
the platform were the more favourable to freedom.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> John Van
Buren's spacious mind and his genius for giving fascination to
whatever he said convulsed his audience with wit and thrilled it with
forceful statements. The country, he declared, was tired of the
agitation of slavery, which had ceased to be a political question. It
only remained to enforce in good faith the great compromise. He
asserted that trade was good and the country prosperous, and that the
Democratic party had gained the confidence of the people because it
was a party of pacification, opposed to the agitation of slavery,
insistent upon sacredly observing the compromises of the Constitution,
and certain to bring settled political conditions.</p>

<p>Prince John proved himself equal to the occasion. If no longer the
great apostle of the Free-soilers he was now the accepted champion of
the Democracy. He had said what everybody believed who voted for
Pierce and what many peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.178" id="Page_ii.178">ii. 178</a></span>ple thought who voted for Scott. There is no
doubt his speech created an immense sensation. Greeley ridiculed it,
Weed belittled it, and the Free-soilers denounced it, but it became
the keynote of the campaign, and the Prince, with his rich, brilliant
copiousness that was never redundant, became the picturesque and
popular speaker of every platform. There were other Democratic
orators.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Charles O'Conor's speeches were masterpieces of
declamation, and James T. Brady, then thirty-seven years old, but
already famous as one of the foremost criminal lawyers of the time,
discovered the same magnetic eloquence that made him almost
irresistible before a jury. His sentences, rounded and polished,
rolled from his mouth in perfect balance. Van Buren was kaleidoscopic,
becoming by turn humourous, sarcastic, gravely logical, and famously
witty; Brady and O'Conor inclined to severity, easily dropping into
vituperation, and at times exhibiting bitterness. Van Buren's hardest
hits came in the form of sarcasm. It mattered not who heard him, all
went away good-natured and satisfied with the entertainment. There
were moments when laughter drowned his loudest utterances, when
silence made his whispers audible, and when an eloquent epigram
moistened the eye.</p>

<p>The election proved a Waterloo to the Whigs. Twenty-seven States gave
majorities for Pierce, only four were for Scott. Seymour ran 22,000
votes ahead of Hunt.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In the Assembly the Democrats numbered
eighty-five, the Whigs forty-three. Of the thirty-three congressmen,
the Democrats elected twenty-one, the Whigs ten, the Free-soilers and
Land Reformers one each. It was wittily said that the Whig party &quot;died
of an attempt to swallow the fugitive slave law.&quot; The election of
Pierce and Seymour surprised none of the Whig leaders. Thurlow Weed,
convinced of the hopelessness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.179" id="Page_ii.179">ii. 179</a></span> Whig success, went off to Europe for
six months preceding the campaign. The <i>Tribune</i> talked of victory,
but in his private correspondence Greeley declared that &quot;we shall lose
the Legislature and probably everything at home.&quot;</p>

<p>Winfield Scott seems to have been the only man really surprised. &quot;He
looked forward buoyantly to an easy and triumphant victory,&quot; says
Weed, who dined with him on a Sunday in October.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> But, though
Pierce's election produced no surprise, his majority of 212 electoral
votes astounded everybody. It eclipsed the result of the romantic
campaign of 1840, and seemed to verify the assertions of John Van
Buren, in his Fourth of July speech at Tammany Hall. The people were
not only tired of slavery agitation, but trade was good, the country
prosperous, and a reunited Democracy, by unreservedly indorsing the
compromise measures of 1850, promised settled conditions.</p>

<p>It is not without historical interest to notice that Gerrit Smith, one
of the most uncompromising opponents of slavery in any country,
received an election to Congress in a district that gave Pierce and
Seymour upward of one thousand majority. It showed that the
smouldering fire, which had suddenly blazed out in the Free-soil
campaign of 1848, was not extinguished by the coalition of Barnburners
and Hunkers, and the acceptance of the great compromise by the two
Baltimore conventions. Gerrit Smith was a noble example of the
champions of freedom. He had not the passion of Garrison, or the
genius of Henry Ward Beecher; but his deep voice of marvellous
richness, the grace and dignity of his person, and the calm, gentle,
dispassionate tone in which he declared his principles without fear,
was to command the earnest and respectful attention of the national
House of Representatives.</p>

THE HARDS AND THE SOFTS<br />
<br />
1853</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">In New York</span> a Democratic victory had come to mean a succession of
Democratic defeats. It was so after the victory of 1844; and it was
destined to be so after the victory of 1852. But defeat occurred
differently this time. In 1847 the Barnburners had seceded from the
Hunkers; in 1853 the Hunkers seceded from the Barnburners. For six
years the Barnburners had played bold politics. After defeating the
Democratic ticket in 1847 and the state and national tickets in 1848,
they returned to the party practically upon their own terms. Instead
of asking admittance they walked in without knocking. They did not
even apologise for their Free-soil principles. These they left behind
because they had put them off; but the sorrow that follows repentance
was absent. In the convention of 1849, John Van Buren was received
like a prodigal son and his followers invited to an equal division of
the spoils. Had the Hunkers declared they didn't know them as
Democrats in their unrepentant attitude, the Barnburner host must have
melted like frost work; but, in their desire to return to power, the
Hunkers asked no questions and fixed no conditions. In the process of
this reunion Horatio Seymour, the cleverest of the Hunkers, coalesced
with the shrewdest of the Barnburners, who set about to capture
William L. Marcy. Seymour knew of Marcy's ambition to become a
candidate for the Presidency and of the rivalry of Cass and Dickinson;
and so when he agreed to make him the Barnburners' candidate, Marcy
covenanted to defeat Cass at Baltimore and Dickinson in New York.
Though the Barn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.181" id="Page_ii.181">ii. 181</a></span>burners failed to make Marcy a nominee for President,
he did not fail to defeat Cass and slaughter Dickinson.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>To add to the Hunkers' humiliation, President Pierce now sided with
the Barnburners. He invited John A. Dix to visit him at Concord, and
in the most cordial manner offered him the position of secretary of
state.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> This was too much for the pro-slavery Hunkers, for Dix had
been a Free-soil candidate for governor in 1848; and the notes of
defiance compelled the Concord statesman to send for Dix again, who
graciously relieved him of his embarrassment.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Then the President
turned to William L. Marcy, whose return from Florida was coincident
with the intrigue against Dix. The former secretary of war had not
mustered with the Free-soilers, but his attitude at Baltimore made him
<i>persona non grata</i> to Dickinson. This kept Pierce in trouble. He
wanted a New Yorker, but he wanted peace, and so he delayed action
until the day after his inauguration.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> When it proved to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.182" id="Page_ii.182">ii. 182</a></span>
Marcy, with Dix promised the mission to France,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and Dickinson
offered nothing better than the collectorship of the port of New York,
the Hunkers waited for an opportunity to make their resentment felt.</p>

<p>This was the situation when the Democratic state convention met at
Syracuse on September 13, 1853, with thirty-six contested seats. The
faction that won these would legally control the convention. When the
doors opened, therefore, an eager crowd, amidst the wildest confusion
and uproar, took possession of the hall, and, with mingled cheers and
hisses, two chairmen were quickly nominated, declared elected, and
forced upon the platform. Each chairman presided. Two conventions
occupied one room; and that one faction might have peaceable
possession it tried to put the other out. Finally, when out of breath
and out of patience, both factions agreed to submit the contest for
seats to a vote of the convention; and while the roll was being
prepared the riotous proceedings were adjourned until four o'clock.
But the Hunkers had seen and heard enough. It was evident the
Barnburners proposed organising the convention after the tactics of
the Hunkers in 1847; and, instead of returning to the hall, the
Hunkers went elsewhere, organising a convention with eighty-one
delegates, including the contestants. Here everything was done in
order and with dispatch. Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.183" id="Page_ii.183">ii. 183</a></span>mittees on permanent officers,
resolutions, and nominations made unanimous reports to a unanimous
convention, speeches were vociferously applauded, and the conduct of
the Barnburners fiercely condemned. Governor Willard of Indiana, who
happened to be present, declared, in a thrilling speech, that a
&quot;bully&quot; stood ready to shoot down the Hunker chairman as he tried to
call the convention to order. One of the delegates said he thought his
life was in danger as he saw a man with an axe under his arm. But in
their hall of refuge no one appeared to molest them; and by six
o'clock the convention had completed its work and adjourned. Among
those nominated for office appeared the names of George W. Clinton of
Buffalo, the distinguished son of DeWitt Clinton, for secretary of
state, and James T. Brady, the brilliant lawyer of New York City, for
attorney-general. The resolutions indorsed the Baltimore platform,
approved the President's inaugural on slavery, commended the amendment
to the Constitution appropriating ten and a half million dollars for
the enlargement and completion of the canals, and complimented Daniel
S. Dickinson.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Barnburners, having reassembled at four o'clock with
eighty-seven delegates, sent word to the Hunkers that the convention
was in session and prepared to organise. To this the chairman replied:
&quot;We do not consider ourselves in safety in an assemblage controlled
and overawed by bullies, imported for that purpose.&quot; The Barnburners
laughed, but in order to give the Hunkers time to sleep over it John
Van Buren opposed further proceedings until the next day. In the
evening, Horatio Seymour, now the Governor, met the convention leaders
and with them laid out the morrow's work.</p>

<p>When Seymour began co-operating with the Barnburners, ambition
prompted him to modify his original canal views so far as to oppose
the Whig law authorising a loan of nine million dollars to enlarge the
Erie canal. But after his election as governor, he recognised that no
party could successfully appeal to the people in November, 1853,
weighted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.184" id="Page_ii.184">ii. 184</a></span> such a policy; and with courage and genius for
diplomatic negotiations, he faced the prejudices which had
characterised the Barnburners during their entire history by favouring
a constitutional amendment appropriating ten and a half millions for
the enlargement of the Erie and the completion of the lateral canals.
He had displayed a bold hand. The help of the Barnburners was needed
to carry the amendment; and when the regular session expired without
the accomplishment of his purpose Seymour quickly called an extra
session. Even this dragged into the summer. Finally, in June, to the
amazement of the people, the amendment passed and was approved. It was
this work, which had so brilliantly inaugurated his administration,
that Seymour desired indorsed, and, although it was morning, and not
very early morning, before the labour of the night ended, it was
agreed to adopt a canal resolution similar to that of the Hunkers and
to indorse the Governor's administration, a compliment which the
Hunkers carefully avoided.</p>

<p>After the settlement of the canal question, the work of the convention
was practically done. A majority of the candidates were taken from the
supporters of Cass in 1848, and included Charles H. Ruggles of
Poughkeepsie, and Hiram Denio of Utica, whom the Hunkers had nominated
for judges of the Court of Appeals. Ruggles was the wise chairman of
the judiciary committee in the constitutional convention of 1846, and
had been a member of the Court of Appeals since 1851. Denio was
destined to become one of the eminent judges of the State. He was not
always kind in his methods. Indeed, it may be said that he was one of
those upright judges who contrived to make neither honour nor
rectitude seem lovable qualities; yet his abilities finally earned him
an enviable reputation as a justice of New York's court of last
resort.</p>

<p>The factions differed little in men or in principle, and not at all
upon the question of slavery. Two conventions were, therefore,
absolutely unnecessary except upon the theory that the Hunkers, having
little to gain and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.185" id="Page_ii.185">ii. 185</a></span> to lose, desired to embarrass the
administrations of Governor Seymour and President Pierce. Their
secession was certainly not prompted by fear of bullies. Neither
faction was a stranger to blows. If fear possessed the Hunkers, it
grew out of distrust of their supporters and of their numerical
strength; and, rather than be beaten, they preferred to follow the
example of the Barnburners in 1847, and of the Silver-Grays in 1850,
two precedents that destroyed party loyalty to gratify the spirit of
revenge.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the Hunkers were first called Hardshells or
&quot;Hards,&quot; and the Barnburners Softshells or &quot;Softs.&quot; These designations
meant that Dickinson and his followers never changed their principles,
and that the Marcy-Seymour coalition trimmed its sails to catch the
favouring breeze.</p>

<p>The action of the Hards in September, 1853, left the prestige of
regularity with the Softs. The latter also had the patronage of the
state and national administrations, the possession of Tammany, and the
support of a large majority of the newspapers. But the Hards still
treated the Softs as the real secessionists. &quot;We have gotten rid of
the mischievous traitors,&quot; said Daniel S. Dickinson, in his Buffalo
speech of September 23, &quot;and let us keep clear of them. It is true
they say we are all on one platform, but when did we get there? No
longer ago than last winter, when such resolutions as the platform now
embodies were introduced into the Assembly, a cholera patient could
not have scattered these very men more effectually.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Dickinson
was not blessed with John Van Buren's humour. A flash of wit rarely
enlivened his speeches, yet he delighted in attacking an adversary
even if compelled to do it with gloomy, dogged rhetoric. Of all the
Softs, however, Horatio Seymour was the one whom Dickinson hated. &quot;It
was the first time a governor was ever found in their convention,&quot;
continued the Binghamton statesman, &quot;and I know it will be the last
time <i>that</i> Governor will be guilty of such an impropriety. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.186" id="Page_ii.186">ii. 186</a></span>
tempted them on with spoils in front, while the short boys of New York
pricked them up with bowie knives in the rear.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Seymour appears to have taken Dickinson's animosity, as he took most
things, with composure. Nevertheless, if he looked for harmony on
election day, the letters of Charles O'Conor and Greene C. Bronson,
declining an invitation to ratify the Softs' ticket at a meeting in
Tammany Hall, must have extinguished the hope. O'Conor was United
States attorney and Bronson collector of the port of New York; but
these two office-holders under Pierce used no varnish in their
correspondence with the Pierce-Seymour faction. &quot;As a lover of honesty
in politics and of good order in society,&quot; wrote Bronson, &quot;I cannot
approve of nominations brought about by fraud and violence. Those who
introduce convicts and bullies into our conventions for the purpose of
controlling events must not expect their proceedings will be
sanctioned by me.&quot; Then he betrayed the old conservative's deep
dislike of the Radicals' canal policy, the memory of which still
rankled. &quot;If all the nominees were otherwise unexceptionable,&quot; he
continued, &quot;they come before the public under the leadership of men
who have been striving to defeat the early completion of the public
works, and after the shameless breach of past pledges in relation to
the canals, there can be no reasonable ground for hope that new
promises will be performed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Charles O'Conor, with the envenomed skill of a practised prosecutor
coupled with a champion's coolness, aimed a heavier blow at the
offending Softs. &quot;Judging the tickets by the names of the leading
members of the two conventions no reasonable doubt can be entertained
which of them is most devoted to preserving union and harmony between
the States of this confederacy. One of the conventions was
uncontaminated by the presence of a single member ever known as an
agitator of principles or practices tending in any de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.187" id="Page_ii.187">ii. 187</a></span>gree to disturb
that union and harmony; the leaders of the other were but recently
engaged in a course of political action directly tending to discord
between the States. It has, indeed, presented a platform of principles
unqualifiedly denouncing that political organisation as dangerous to
the permanency of the Union and inadmissible among Democrats; but when
it is considered that the leaders, with one unimpressive exception,
formerly withheld assent to that platform, or repudiated it, the
resolution adopting it is not, in my opinion, entitled to any
confidence whatever. I adopt that ticket which was made by a
convention whose platform was adopted with sincerity and corresponds
with the political life and actions of its framers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Bronson's letter was dated September 22, 1853; and in less than a
month he was removed from his post as collector. In resentment,
several county conventions immediately announced him as their
candidate for governor in 1854. O'Conor continued in office a little
longer, but eventually he resigned. &quot;This proscriptive policy for
opinion's sake will greatly accelerate and aggravate the decomposition
of the Democratic party in this State,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>. &quot;That
process was begun long since, but certain soft-headed quacks had
thought it possible, by some hocus pocus, to restore the old unity and
health.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The Whigs delayed their state convention until the 5th of October.
Washington Hunt, its chairman, made a strong plea for harmony, and in
the presence of almost certain victory, occasioned by a divided
Democracy, the delegates turned their attention to the work of making
nominations. It took three ballots to select a candidate for
attorney-general. Among the aspirants were Ogden Hoffman of New York
and Roscoe Conkling of Utica, then a young man of twenty-five, who
bore a name that was already familiar from an honourable parentage.
The people of Oneida had elected him district attorney as soon as he
gained his majority, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.188" id="Page_ii.188">ii. 188</a></span> in the intervening years, the successful
lawyer had rapidly proved himself a successful orator and politician
who would have to be reckoned with.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>But Conkling did not get the coveted attorney-generalship. The great
reputation of Ogden Hoffman, who has been styled &quot;the Erskine of the
American bar,&quot; and who then stood in isolated splendour among the
orators of his party, gave him the right of way. Hoffman had served in
Congress during Van Buren's administration and as United States
attorney under Harrison and Tyler. He was now sixty years of age, a
fit opponent to the brilliant Brady, twenty-two years his junior. &quot;But
for indolence,&quot; said Horace Greeley, &quot;Hoffman might have been governor
or cabinet minister ere this. Everybody likes him and he always runs
ahead of his ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> There was also an earnest effort to secure
a place upon the ticket for Elbridge G. Spaulding of Buffalo. He had
been district attorney, city clerk, alderman, and mayor of his city.
In 1848 he went to the Assembly and in 1849 to Congress. He had
already disclosed the marked ability for finance that subsequently
characterised his public and business career, giving him the
distinguishing title of &quot;father of the greenback.&quot; His friends now
wanted to make him comptroller, but when this place went to James M.
Cook of Saratoga, a thrifty banker and manufacturer, who had been
state treasurer, Spaulding accepted the latter office. In its
platform, the convention hailed with satisfaction the prospect of a
speedy completion of the canals under Whig management, and boasted
that the Democrats had at last been forced to accept the Whig policy,
&quot;so necessary to the greatness and prosperity of the State.&quot;</p>

<p>The success of the Whigs was inevitable. The secession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.189" id="Page_ii.189">ii. 189</a></span> the Hards
could not operate otherwise than in a division of the Democratic vote;
but no one dreamed it would split the party in the middle. The Hards
had fought against the prestige of party regularity, the power of
patronage, the influence of Tammany, and the majority of the press,
while the removal of Bronson served notice upon office-holders that
those who favoured the Hards voluntarily mounted a guillotine. &quot;Heads
of this class,&quot; said Greeley, &quot;rolled as recklessly as pumpkins from a
harvest wagon.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Yet the Softs led the Hards by an average
majority of only 312. It was a tremendous surprise at Washington. A
cartoon represented Pierce and Marcy as Louis XVI and his minister, on
the memorable 10th of August. &quot;Why, this is revolt!&quot; said the amazed
King. &quot;No, sire,&quot; responded the minister, &quot;it is Revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>The Whigs polled 162,000 votes, electing their state officers by an
average plurality of 66,000 and carrying the Legislature by a majority
of forty-eight on joint ballot. Yet Ruggles and Denio, whose names
appeared upon the ticket of each Democratic faction, were elected to
the Court of Appeals by 13,000 majority, showing that a united
Democratic party would have swept the State as it did in 1852.</p>

<p>The Whigs accepted their success as Sheridan said the English received
the peace of Amiens&#8212;as &quot;one of which everybody was glad and nobody
was proud.&quot; Of the 240,000 Whigs who voted in 1852, less than 170,000
supported the ticket in 1853. Some of this shrinkage was doubtless due
to the natural falling off in an &quot;off year&quot; and to an unusually stormy
election day; but there were evidences of open revolt and studied
apathy which emphasised the want of harmony and the necessity for
fixed principles.</p>

<br />
A BREAKING-UP OF PARTY TIES<br />
<br />
1854</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> the Hards and Softs quarrelled, and the Whigs showed weakness
because of a want of harmony and the lack of principles, a great
contest was being waged at Washington. In December, 1853, Stephen A.
Douglas, from his place in the United States Senate, introduced the
famous Nebraska bill affirming that the Clay compromise of 1850 had
repealed the Missouri compromise of 1820. This sounded the trumpet of
battle. The struggle of slavery and freedom was now to be fought to a
finish. The discussion in Congress began in January, 1854, and ended
on May 30. When it commenced the slavery question seemed settled; when
it closed the country was in a ferment. Anti-slavery Whigs found
companionship with Free-soil Democrats; the titles of &quot;Nebraska&quot; and
&quot;Anti-Nebraska&quot; distinguished men's politics; conventions of
Democrats, Whigs, and Free-soilers met to resist &quot;the iniquity;&quot; and
on July 6 the Republican party, under whose banner the great fight was
to be finished, found a birthplace at Jackson, Michigan.</p>

<p>Rufus King's part in the historic struggle of the Missouri Compromise
was played by William H. Seward in the great contest over its repeal.
He was the leader of the anti-slavery Whigs of the country, just as
his distinguished predecessor had been the leader of the anti-slavery
forces in 1820. He marshalled the opposition, and, when he finally
took the floor on the 17th of February, he made a legal argument as
close, logical, and carefully considered as if addressed to the
Supreme Court of the United States. He developed the history of
slavery and its successive compromises; he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.191" id="Page_ii.191">ii. 191</a></span> every argument in
favour of the bill; he appealed to its supporters to admit that they
never dreamed of its abrogating the compromise of 1820; he ridiculed
the idea that it was in the interest of peace; and he again referred
to the &quot;higher law&quot; that had characterised his speech in 1850. &quot;The
slavery agitation you deprecate so much,&quot; he said in concluding, &quot;is
an eternal struggle between conservatism and progress; between truth
and error; between right and wrong. You may sooner, by act of
Congress, compel the sea to suppress its upheavings, and the round
earth to extinguish its internal fires. You may legislate, and
abrogate, and abnegate, as you will, but there is a Superior Power
that overrules all; that overrules not only all your actions and all
your refusals to act, but all human events, to the distant but
inevitable result of the equal and universal liberty of all men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Seward was not an orator. He could hardly be called an effective
speaker. He was neither impassioned nor always impressive; but when he
spoke he seemed to strike a blow that had in it the whole vigour and
strength of the public sentiment which he represented. So far as one
can judge from contemporary accounts he never spoke better than on
this occasion; or when it was more evident that he spoke with all the
sincere emotion of one whose mind and heart alike were filled with the
cause for which he pleaded. &quot;Some happy spell,&quot; he wrote his wife,
&quot;seemed to have come over me and to have enabled me to speak with more
freedom and ease than on any former occasion here.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Rhodes
suggests that Seward &quot;could not conceal his exultation that the
Democrats had forsaken their high vantage ground and played into the
hands of their opponents.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> He became almost dramatic when he
threw down his gauntlet at the feet of every member of the Senate in
1850 and challenged him to say that he knew, or thought, or dreamed,
that by enacting the compromise of 1850 he was directly or indirectly
abro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.192" id="Page_ii.192">ii. 192</a></span>gating, or in any degree impairing the Missouri Compromise. &quot;If
it were not irreverent,&quot; he continued, &quot;I would dare call up the
author of both the compromises in question, from his honoured, though
yet scarcely grass-covered grave, and challenge any advocate of this
measure to confront that imperious shade, and say that, in making the
compromise of 1850, Henry Clay intended or dreamed that he was
subverting or preparing the way for a subversion of his greater work
of 1820. Sir, if that spirit is yet lingering here over the scene of
its mortal labours, it is now moved with more than human indignation
against those who are perverting its last great public act.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Seward's speech created a profound impression throughout New York and
the North. &quot;It probably affected the minds of more men,&quot; says Rhodes,
&quot;than any speech delivered on that side of this question in
Congress.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Senator Houston had it translated into German and
extensively circulated among the Germans of western Texas. Even Edwin
Croswell congratulated him upon its excellence. It again directed the
attention of the country to his becoming a presidential candidate,
about which newspapers and politicians had already spoken. Montgomery
Blair's letter of May 17, 1873, to Gideon Welles, charges Seward with
boasting that he had &quot;put Senator Dixon up to moving the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise as an amendment to Douglas' first Kansas bill, and
had himself forced the repeal by that movement, and had thus brought
life to the Republican party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Undoubtedly Seward read the signs
of the times, and saw clearly and quickly that repeal would probably
result in a political revolution, bringing into life an anti-slavery
party that would sweep the country. But the charge that he claimed to
have suggested the repeal, smells too strongly of Welles' dislike of
Seward, and needs other evidence than Blair's telltale letter to
support it. It is on a par with Sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.193" id="Page_ii.193">ii. 193</a></span>ator Atchinson's assertion, made
under the influence of wine, that he forced Douglas to bring in the
Nebraska bill&#8212;a statement that the Illinois Senator promptly stamped
as false.</p>

<p>The temper of the people of the State began to change very soon after
the introduction of Douglas' proposal. Remonstrances, letters, and
resolutions poured in from Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, and
other cities. Senator Fish presented a petition headed by the Bishop
of the Episcopal Church and signed by a majority of the clergymen of
New York City. Merchants, lawyers, and business men generally, who had
actively favoured the compromise of 1850, now spoke in earnest protest
against the repeal of the compromise of 1820. From the first, the
Germans opposed it. Of their newspapers only eight out of eighty-eight
were favourable. Public meetings, full of enthusiasm and noble
sentiment, resembled religious gatherings enlisted in a holy war
against a great social evil. The first assembled in New York City as
early as January 30, six days after the repeal was agreed upon.
Another larger meeting occurred on the 18th of February. It was here
that Henry Ward Beecher's great genius asserted the fulness of its
intellectual power. He had been in Brooklyn five years. The series of
forensic achievements which began at the Kossuth banquet in 1851 had
already made him the favourite speaker of the city, but, on the 18th
of February, he became the idol of the anti-slavery host. Wit, wisdom,
patriotism, and pathos, mingled with the loftiest strains of
eloquence, compelled the attention and the admiration of every
listener. When he concluded the whole assembly rose to do him honour;
tears rolled down the cheeks of men and women. Everything was
forgotten, save the great preacher and the cause for which he stood.
&quot;The storm that is rising,&quot; wrote Seward, &quot;is such an one as this
country has never yet seen. The struggle will go on, but it will be a
struggle for the whole American people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In the <i>Tribune</i> of May
17, Greeley said that Pierce and Douglas had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.194" id="Page_ii.194">ii. 194</a></span> more Abolitionists
in three months than Garrison and Phillips could have made in half a
century.</p>

<p>The agitation resulted in an anti-Nebraska state convention, held at
Saratoga on the 16th of August. It was important in the men who
composed it. John A. King called it to order; Horace Greeley reported
the resolutions; Henry J. Raymond represented the district that had
twice sent him to the Assembly; and Moses H. Grinnell became chairman
of its executive committee. In the political struggles of two decades
most of its delegates had filled prominent and influential positions.
These men were now brought together by an absorbing sense of duty and
a common impulse of resistance to the encroachments of slavery. People
supposed a new party would be formed and a ticket nominated as in
Michigan; but after an animated and at times stormy discussion, the
delegates concluded that in principle too little difference existed to
warrant the present disturbance of existing organisations. So, after
declaring sentiments which were to become stronger than party ties or
party discipline, it agreed to reassemble at Auburn on September
26.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.195" id="Page_ii.195">ii. 195</a></span></p>
<p>The Nebraska Act also became a new source of division to Democrats.
Marcy's opposition, based upon apprehensions of its disastrous effect
in New York, was so pronounced that he contemplated resigning as
secretary of state&#8212;a step that his friends persuaded him to abandon.
John Van Buren was equally agitated. &quot;Could anything but a desire to
buy the South at the presidential shambles dictate such an
outrage?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> he asked Senator Clemens of Alabama. But nothing could
stop the progress of the Illinois statesman; and, while the Whigs of
New York ably and uniformly opposed repeal, Democrats broke along the
lines dividing the Hards and the Softs. Of twenty-one Democratic
congressmen, nine favoured and twelve opposed it. Among the former was
William M. Tweed, the unsavoury boss of later years; among the latter,
Reuben E. Fenton, Rufus W. Peckham, and Russell Sage. The Democratic
press separated along similar lines. Thirty-seven Hards supported the
measure; thirty-eight Softs opposed it.</p>

<p>The Hards held their state convention on the 12th of July. Their late
trial of strength with the Softs had resulted in a drawn battle, and
it was now their purpose to force the Pierce-Seymour Softs out of the
party. The proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.196" id="Page_ii.196">ii. 196</a></span> began with a challenge. Lyman Tremaine spoke
of the convention as one in which the President had no minions; Samuel
Beardsley, the chairman, after charging Pierce with talking one way
and acting another, declared that the next Chief Executive would both
talk and act like a national Democrat. Further, to emphasise its
independence and dislike of the President, the convention nominated
Greene C. Bronson for governor as the representative of Pierce's
proscriptive policy for opinion's sake. But there was no disposition
to criticise Pierce's pro-slavery policy. It favoured the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise, proclaiming the doctrine of non-intervention
by Congress and the right of the territories to make their own local
laws, including regulations relating to domestic servitude. It also
approved the recently ratified canal amendment and strongly favoured
the prohibitive liquor law vetoed by Governor Seymour.</p>

<p>Greene C. Bronson's career had been distinguished. He had served as
assemblyman, as attorney-general for seven years, as chief justice of
the Supreme Court, and as an original member of the Court of Appeals.
Although now well advanced in years, age had not cowed his spirit or
lessened the purity of a character which shone in the gentleness of
amiable manners; but his pro-slavery platform hit his consistency a
hard blow. In 1819, as secretary of a mass-meeting called to oppose
the Missouri Compromise, he had declared that Congress possessed the
clear and indisputable power to prohibit the admission of slavery in
any State or territory thereafter to be formed. If this was good law
in 1819 it was good law in 1854, and the acceptance of a contrary
theory put him at a serious disadvantage. His attitude on the liquor
question also proved a handicap. He showed that the position of judge
in interpreting the law was a very different thing from that of making
the law by steering a party into power in a crucial campaign.</p>

<p>The convention of the Softs followed on September 6. Two preliminary
caucuses indicated a strong anti-Nebraska sentiment. But a bold and
resolute opposition, led by federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.197" id="Page_ii.197">ii. 197</a></span> officials and John Cochrane, the
Barnburners' platform-maker, portended trouble. There was no
disagreement on state issues. The approval of Seymour's administration
settled the policy of canal improvement and anti-prohibition, but the
delegates balked on the cunningly worded resolution declaring the
repeal of the Missouri Compromise inexpedient and unnecessary, yet
rejoicing that it would benefit the territories and forbidding any
attempt to undo it. It put the stamp of Nebraska upon the proceedings,
and the deathlike stillness which greeted its reading shook the nerves
of the superstitious as an unfavourable omen. Immediately, a short
substitute was offered, unqualifiedly disapproving the repeal as a
violation of legislative good faith and of the spirit of Christian
civilisation; and when Preston King took the floor in its favour the
deafening applause disclosed the fact that the anti-Nebraskans had the
enthusiasm if not the numbers. As the champion of the Wilmot Proviso
concluded, the assembly resembled the Buffalo convention of 1848 at
the moment of its declaration for free soil, free speech, free labour,
and free men. But the roll call changed the scene. Of the 394
delegates, 245 voted to lay the substitute on the table.</p>

<p>This result was a profound surprise. The public expected different
action and the preliminary caucuses showed an anti-Nebraska majority;
but the Custom-House had done its work well. The promise of a
nomination for lieutenant-governor had changed the mind of William H.
Ludlow, chairman of the convention, who packed the committee on
resolutions. Similar methods won fifty other delegates. But despite
the shock, Preston King did not hesitate. He might be broken, but he
could not be bent. Rising with dignity he withdrew from the
convention, followed by a hundred others who ceased to act further
with it. Subsequent proceedings reflected the gloom of a body out of
which the spirit had departed. Delegates kept dropping out until only
one hundred and ninety-nine remained to cheer the nomination of
Horatio Seymour. On a roll call for lieutenant-governor, Philip
Dor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.198" id="Page_ii.198">ii. 198</a></span>sheimer declared it a disgrace to have his name called in a
convention that had adopted such a platform.</p>

<p>The Whig convention followed on September 20. A divided Democracy
again made candidates confident, and eight or ten names were presented
for governor. Horace Greeley thought it time his turn should come. He
had been pronounced in his advocacy of the Maine liquor law and active
in his hostility to the Nebraska Act. As these were to be the issues
of the campaign, he applied with confidence to Weed for help. The
Albany editor frankly admitted that his friends had lost control of
the convention, and that Myron H. Clark would probably get the
nomination. Then Greeley asked to be made lieutenant-governor. Weed
reminded him of the outcry in the Whig national convention of 1848
against having &quot;cotton at both ends of the ticket.&quot; &quot;I suppose you
mean,&quot; replied Greeley, laughing, &quot;that it won't do to have
prohibition at both ends of our state ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> But, though he
laughed, the editor of the <i>Tribune</i> went away nettled and humiliated.
In the contest, which became exciting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.199" id="Page_ii.199">ii. 199</a></span> Greeley's friends urged his
selection for governor without formally presenting his name to the
convention; but on the third ballot Clark received the nomination,
obtaining 82 out of the 132 votes cast.</p>

<p>Myron H. Clark, now in his forty-ninth year, belonged to the class of
men generally known as fanatics. He was a plain man of humble
pretensions and slender attainments. He was originally a cabinet-maker
and afterward a merchant. Then he became a reformer. He sympathised
with the Native Americans; he approved Seward's views upon slavery;
and he interested himself in the workingmen. But his hobby was
temperance. Its advocates made his home in Canandaigua their
headquarters, and during the temperance revival which swept over the
State in the early fifties, he aided in directing the movement. This
experience opened his way, in 1851, to the State Senate. Here he
displayed some of the legislative gifts that distinguished John Young.
He had patience and persistence; he could talk easily and well; and,
underneath his enthusiasm, lingered the shrewdness of a skilled
diplomat. When, at last, the Maine liquor bill, which he had
introduced and engineered, passed the Legislature, his name was a
household word throughout the State. Seymour's veto of the measure
strengthened Clark. People realised that a governor no less than a
legislature was needed to make laws, and, with the spirit of
reformers, the delegates demanded his nomination. To Weed it seemed
hazardous; but a majority of the convention, believing that Clark's
public career had been sagacious and upright, refused to take another.</p>

<p>Clark's nomination made the selection of a candidate for
lieutenant-governor more difficult. The prohibitionists were
satisfied; Greeley was not. In their anxiety, the delegates canvassed
several names without result. Finally, with great suddenness and
amidst much enthusiasm, Henry J. Raymond was nominated. This deeply
wounded Greeley. &quot;He had cheerfully withdrawn his own name,&quot; wrote
Weed, &quot;but he could not submit patiently to the nomination of his
per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.200" id="Page_ii.200">ii. 200</a></span>sonal, professional, and political rival.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Greeley believed
it was not the convention, but Weed himself, who brought it about. On
the contrary, Weed declared that he had no thought of Raymond in that
connection until his name was suggested by others. Nevertheless, the
<i>Tribune's</i> editor held to his own opinion. &quot;No other name could have
been put upon the ticket so bitterly humbling to me,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> he
afterward wrote Seward. To Greeley, Raymond was &quot;The little Villain of
the <i>Times</i>;&quot; to Raymond, Greeley was &quot;The big Villain of the
<i>Tribune</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> In any aspect, Raymond was an unfortunate nomination
for Weed, since it began the quarrel that culminated in the defeat of
Seward at Chicago in 1860.</p>

<p>Early in the campaign, Greeley favoured dropping the name of Whig and
organising an anti-Nebraska or Republican party, with a ticket of
Whigs and Democrats, as had been done in some of the Western States.
But Seward and Weed, with a majority of the Whig leaders, thought that
while fusion might be advisable wherever the party was essentially
weak, as in Ohio and Indiana, it was wiser, in States like New York
and Massachusetts where Whigs were in power, to retain the party name
and organisation.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In so deciding, however, they agreed with
Greeley that the platform should be thoroughly anti-Nebraska, and they
gave it a touch that kindled the old fire in the hearts of the
anti-slavery veterans. It condemned the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise, approved the course of the New York senators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.201" id="Page_ii.201">ii. 201</a></span> and
representatives who resisted it, declared that it discharged the party
from further obligation to support any compromise with slavery, and
denounced &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; as a false and deceptive cry, &quot;too
flimsy to mislead any but those anxious to be deluded and eager to be
led astray.&quot; This declaration of principles was summarised as
&quot;Justice, Temperance, and Freedom.&quot; One delegate, amidst great
applause, said he felt glorified that the party was disenthralled and
redeemed. Roscoe Conkling, a vice president, spoke of the convention
as belonging to &quot;the Republican party.&quot; Greeley declared the platform
&quot;as noble as any friend of freedom could have expected.&quot; Other state
organisations also approved it. The anti-Nebraska convention, upon
reassembling in Auburn on September 26, adopted the Whig ticket. The
state temperance convention indorsed the nomination of Clark and
Raymond, and the Free Democrats accepted Clark. This practically made
a fusion ticket.</p>

<p>Early in October the Native Americans went into council. This
organisation, which had elected a mayor of New York in 1844, suddenly
revived in 1854; and, in spite of its intolerant and prescriptive
spirit, the movement spread rapidly. Mystery surrounded its methods.
It held meetings in unknown places; its influence could not be
measured; and its members professed to know nothing. Thus it became
known as the &quot;Know-Nothing&quot; party. Members recognised each other by
the casual inquiry, &quot;Have you seen Sam?&quot; and when one of the old
parties collapsed at a local election the reply came, &quot;We have seen
Sam.&quot; Its secrecy fascinated young men, and its dominant principle,
&quot;America for Americans,&quot; stirred them into unusual activity. The
skilful use of patriotic phrases also had its influence. The &quot;Star
Spangled Banner&quot; was its emblem, Washington its patron saint, and his
thrilling command, &quot;Put none but Americans on guard to-night,&quot; its
favourite password. Henry Wilson of Massachusetts joined it as an
instrument for destroying the old parties, which he regarded an
obstacle to freedom; but Seward thought this was doing evil that good
might come. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.202" id="Page_ii.202">ii. 202</a></span>thing is un-American, he argued, which makes a
distinction between the native-born American and the one who renounces
his allegiance to a foreign land and swears fealty to the country that
adopts him. &quot;Why,&quot; he asked, &quot;should I exclude the foreigner to-day?
He is only what every American citizen or his ancestor was at some
time or other.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The voting strength of this party in New York was estimated at 65,000,
divided between Hards, Softs, and Whigs, with one-fifth each, and the
Silver-Grays with two-fifths. On the question of putting up a state
ticket, its council divided. The Silver-Grays, it was said, favoured
candidates in order to defeat Clark; while the Whigs and Softs
preferred making no nominations. In the end, Daniel Ullman, a
reputable New York lawyer of mediocre ability, received the nomination
for governor. The great overmastering passion of Ullman was a desire
for office. For many years he had been a persistent and unsuccessful
knocker at the door of city, county and state Whig conventions, and
when the Know-Nothings appeared he turned to them to back his
ambition. Possibly they knew that his parents were foreign-born, but
the mystery surrounding his own birthplace became a comical feature of
the canvass. It was claimed, upon what seemed proper evidence at the
time, that Ullman was born in India and had not become a naturalised
citizen of the United States. This made him ineligible as the
candidate of his party, and disqualified him from serving as governor
if elected.</p>

<p>The campaign opened with two clearly defined issues&#8212;limitation of the
liquor traffic and condemnation of the Nebraska Act. Clark stood for
both, Ullman stood for neither; Bronson and Seymour opposed
prohibition and approved the Nebraska Act. Greeley declared that the
two Democratic candidates differed only &quot;as to whether the contempt
universally felt for President Pierce should be openly expressed, or
more decorously cherished in silence.&quot; As the canvass advanced, the
real contest became prohibition, with Bronson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.203" id="Page_ii.203">ii. 203</a></span> and Seymour apparently
running a race for the liquor vote, while Ullman was silently securing
the votes of men who thought the proscription of foreign-born citizens
more important than either freedom or temperance. To the most adroit
political prognosticators the situation was confused. Greeley
estimated Clark's strength at 200,000, and that of the next highest,
either Seymour or Bronson, at 150,000; but so little was known of the
Know-Nothings that he omitted Ullman from the calculation. Another
prophet fixed Ullman's strength at 65,000. The surprise was great,
therefore, when the returns disclosed a Know-Nothing vote of 122,000,
with Clark and Seymour running close to 156,000 each, and Bronson with
less than 35,000. The people did not seem to have been thinking about
Bronson at all. Seymour's veto commended the Governor to the larger
cities, and it swept him on like a whirlwind. New York gave him
26,000. His election was conceded by the Whigs and claimed by the
Democrats; but, after several weeks of anxious waiting, the official
count made Clark the governor by a plurality of 309.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Including
defective votes plainly intended for Seymour, Clark's plurality was
only 153. Raymond ran 600 ahead of Clark, but his plurality over
Ludlow was 20,000, since the latter's vote was 20,000 less than
Seymour's. These twenty thousand preferred to vote for Elijah Ford of
Buffalo, who ran for lieutenant-governor on the ticket with Bronson,
possibly because of Ludlow's alleged perfidy at the Syracuse
convention. Of the congressmen elected, twenty-five were Whigs, three
Softs, two Anti-Nebraskans, and three Know-Nothings; in the Assembly
there were eighty-one Whigs, twenty-six Softs, and seventeen Hards.</p>

<p>The result of the election could scarcely be called a Whig victory;
but it was a popular rebuke to the Nebraska bill. Clark's majority,
slender as it finally appeared by the official count, was due to the
Whigs occupying common ground with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.204" id="Page_ii.204">ii. 204</a></span> Free-soilers who discarded party
attachments in behalf of their cherished convictions. The Silver-Grays
found a home with the Hards and the Know-Nothings, and many Democrats,
unwilling to go to the Whigs, voted for Ullman.</p>

<p>It was the breaking-up of old parties. The great political crisis
which had been threatening the country for many years was about to
burst, and, like the first big raindrops that precede a downpour, the
changes in 1854 announced its presence. It had been so long in coming
that John W. Taylor of Saratoga, the champion opponent of the Missouri
Compromise, was dying when Horace Greeley, at the anti-Nebraska
convention held in Taylor's home in August, 1854, was writing into the
platform of the new Republican party the principles that Taylor tried
to write into the old Republican party in 1820. &quot;Whoever reads
Taylor's speeches in that troubled period,&quot; says Stanton, &quot;will find
them as sound in doctrine, as strong in argument, as splendid in
diction, as any of the utterances of the following forty-five years,
when the thirteenth amendment closed the controversy for all
time.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

1854-5</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> winter of 1855 became a turning-point in the career of William H.
Seward. The voice of the anti-slavery Whigs proclaimed him the only
man fitted by position, ability, and character to succeed himself in
the United States Senate. To them he possessed all the necessary
qualities for leadership. In his hands they believed the banner of
opposition to the extension of slavery would be kept at the front and
every other cause subordinated to it. This feeling was generously
shared by the press of New York. &quot;The repeal of the Missouri
Compromise,&quot; said Henry J. Raymond in the <i>Times</i>, &quot;has developed a
popular sentiment in the North which will probably elect Governor
Seward to the Presidency in 1856 by the largest vote from the free
States ever cast for any candidate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Even the Democratic <i>Evening
Post</i> admitted that &quot;Seward is in the ascendancy in this State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The Legislature was overwhelmingly Whig. Nearly three-fourths of the
Assembly and two-thirds of the Senate had been elected as Whigs.
Although Seward did not make a speech or appear publicly in the
campaign of 1854, he had been active in seeing that members were
chosen who would vote for him. But, notwithstanding the Whigs
controlled the Legislature, many of them belonged to the
Know-Nothings, whose noisy opposition soon filled the air with rumours
of their intention to defeat Seward. The secrecy that veiled the
doings of the order now concealed the strength of their numbers; but,
as Seward's course had been sufficient to array<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.206" id="Page_ii.206">ii. 206</a></span> its entire membership
against him, there was little doubt of the attitude of all its
representatives. Though he had not violently denounced them as Douglas
did at Philadelphia, men of otherwise liberal opinions were angry
because he seemed deliberately to support views opposed to their most
cherished principles. His recommendation, while governor, to divide
the public money with Catholic schools was recalled with bitter
comment. The more recent efforts of Bishop Hughes, an ardent friend of
the Senator, to exclude the Bible from the public schools, added to
the feeling; while the coming of a papal nuncio to adjust a
controversy in regard to church property between a bishop and a
Catholic congregation in Buffalo which had the law of the State on its
side, greatly increased the bitterness. Thus the old controversy was
torn open, hostility increasing so rapidly that Thurlow Weed declared
&quot;there is very much peril about the senator question.&quot;</p>

<p>The plan of the Know-Nothings was to prevent an election in the Senate
and then block a joint session of the two houses. This scheme had
succeeded in defeating Ambrose Spencer in 1825 and Nathaniel P.
Tallmadge in 1845, and there was no apparent reason why similar
methods might not be invoked in 1855, unless the manifest inability of
Seward's adversaries to unite upon some one opponent gave his
supporters the upper hand. Millard Fillmore, Ira Harris, and
Washington Hunt had their friends; but an anti-slavery Know-Nothing
could not support Fillmore or Hunt, and a Silver-Gray Whig did not
take kindly to Harris. This was the corner-stone of Greeley's
confidence. Besides, the more bitter the criticism of Seward's record,
the more inclined were certain senators of the Democratic party, who
did not sympathise with the Know-Nothing aversion to foreigners, to
support the Auburn statesman.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> There was no hope for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.207" id="Page_ii.207">ii. 207</a></span> Seymour, or
Dix, or Preston King, and some of their friends in the Senate who
admired the anti-slavery views of Seward could stop the play of the
Know-Nothings.</p>

<p>Thus the contest grew fiercer. It was the chief topic in Albany. All
debate ended in its discussion. When, at last, DeWitt C. Littlejohn,
vacating the speaker's chair, took the floor for the distinguished New
Yorker, the excitement reached its climax. The speaker's bold and
fearless defence met a storm of personal denunciation that broke from
the ranks of the Know-Nothings; but his speech minimised their
opposition and inspired Seward's forces to work out a magnificent
victory. &quot;Our friends are in good spirits and reasonably confident,&quot;
wrote Seward. &quot;Our adversaries are not confident, and are out of
temper.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Finally, on February 1, the caucus met. Five Whig
senators and twenty assemblymen, representing the bulk of the
opposition, were absent; but of the eighty present, seventy-four voted
for Seward. This stifled the hope of the Silver-Gray Know-Nothings.
Indeed, several of Seward's opponents now fell into line, giving him
eighteen out of thirty-one votes in the Senate and sixty-nine out of
one hundred and twenty-six in the Assembly. The five dissenting Whig
senators voted for Fillmore, Ullman, Ogden Hoffman, Preston King, and
George R. Babcock of Buffalo. Of the nineteen opposing Whig votes in
the Assembly, Washington Hunt received nine and Fillmore four. When
the two houses compared the vote in joint session, Henry J. Raymond,
the lieutenant-governor, announced with evident emotion to a
sympathetic audience which densely packed the Assembly chamber, that
&quot;William H. Seward was duly elected as a senator of the United States
for six years from the fourth of March, 1855.&quot;</p>

<p>Seward did not visit Albany or Auburn during the contest. A patent
suit kept him busy in New York City until the middle of January, after
which he returned to his place in the Senate. He professed to &quot;have
the least possible anxiety about it,&quot; writing Weed early in December
that &quot;I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.208" id="Page_ii.208">ii. 208</a></span> not have you suffer one moment's pain on the ground
that I am not likely to be content and satisfied with whatever may
happen;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> yet a letter written five months afterward, on his
fifty-fifth birthday, gives a glimpse of what defeat would have meant
to him. &quot;How happy I am,&quot; he says, &quot;that age and competence bring no
serious and permanent disappointment to sour and disgust me with
country or mankind.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> To Weed he shows a heart laden with
gratitude. &quot;I snatch a minute,&quot; he writes, &quot;to express not so much my
deep and deepened gratitude to you, as my amazement at the magnitude
and complexity of the dangers through which you have conducted our
shattered bark, and the sagacity and skill with which you have saved
us from so imminent a wreck.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> But Seward was not more amazed at
the dangers he had escaped than at the great number of congratulations
now pouring in from opponents. &quot;Was ever anything more curious,&quot; he
writes his wife, &quot;than the fact that this result is scarcely more
satisfactory to my truest friends, than, as it seems, to so many
lifelong opponents? We have nothing but salutations and
congratulations here. How strange the mutations of politics.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>After Seward's re-election the Kansas troubles began attracting
attention. Governor Reeder fixed March 30, 1855, for the election of a
territorial legislature, and just before it occurred five thousand
Missourians, &quot;with guns upon their shoulders, revolvers stuffing their
belts, bowie-knives protruding from their boot-tops, and generous
rations of whiskey in their wagons,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> marched into the territory
to superintend the voting. This army intimidated such of the election
judges as were not already pro-slavery men; and of six thousand votes,
three-fourths of them were cast by the Missourians in the interest of
slavery. The Northern press recorded the fraud. If further evidence
were needed, Governor Reeder's speech, published in the New York
<i>Times</i> of May 1, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.209" id="Page_ii.209">ii. 209</a></span> he declared that the fierce violence and
wild outrages reported by the newspapers were in no wise exaggerated,
set all controversy at rest. Instantly the North was in a ferment. The
predominant sentiment demanded that Kansas should be free, and the
excitement aroused by the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was
quickly rekindled when the South approved the murderous methods
intended to make it a slave State. A journal published in the
pro-slavery interest threatened &quot;to lynch and hang, tar and feather,
and drown every white-livered Abolitionist who dares to pollute our
soil,&quot; and secret societies, organised for the purpose of keeping out
Northern immigrants, resolved &quot;that we recognise the institution of
slavery as already existing in this territory, and advise
slave-holders to introduce their property as early as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>As the year went on matters got worse. The territorial legislature,
elected by admitted and wholesale fraud, unseated all free-state
members whose election was contested, and proceeded to pass laws
upholding and fortifying slavery. It declared it a felony, punishable
by two years' imprisonment, to write or maintain that persons have not
the right to hold slaves in the territory; it disqualified all
anti-slavery men from sitting as jurors; it made one's presence in the
territory sufficient qualification to vote; and it punished with death
any one who assisted in the escape of fugitive slaves. When Reeder
vetoed these acts the Legislature passed them over his head and
demanded the Governor's removal. To add to the popular feeling,
already deeply inflamed, President Pierce met this demand with
affirmative action.</p>

<p>In the midst of this political excitement, the Hards met in convention
at Syracuse on August 23, 1855. That party had been sorely punished in
the preceding election; but it had in no way changed its attitude
toward opponents. It refused to invite the Softs to participate; it
denounced the national administration, and it condemned the
Know-Nothings. Daniel E. Sickles, then thirty-four years old, who was
destined to play a conspicuous part when the country was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.210" id="Page_ii.210">ii. 210</a></span> in
difficulty and the Government in danger, sought to broaden and
liberalise its work; but the convention sullenly outvoted him. It
approved the Nebraska Act, refused to listen to appeals in behalf of
freedom in Kansas, and rebuked all efforts to restore the Missouri
Compromise. Only upon the liquor question did it modify its former
declarations. The Hards had started off in 1854 in favour of
prohibition. But during the campaign, Bronson changed his position,
or, as Greeley put it, &quot;he first inclined to water, then to rum and
water, and finally he came out all rum.&quot; To keep in accord with their
leader's latest change, the delegates now declared the prohibitory law
unconstitutional and demanded its repeal. This law, passed on April 9,
1855, and entitled &quot;An Act for the prevention of intemperance,
pauperism, and crime,&quot; permitted the sale of liquors for mechanical,
chemical, and medicinal uses; but prohibited the traffic for other
purposes. Its regulations, providing for search, prosecutions, and the
destruction of forfeited liquors, were the very strongest, and its
enforcement gave rise to much litigation. Among other things it denied
trial by jury. In May, 1856, the Court of Appeals declared it
unconstitutional. But while it lasted it gave the politicians much
concern. The Democrats disapproved and other parties avoided it.</p>

<p>On August 29, the Softs met in convention. The Barnburners, who had
vainly extended the olive branch to the Hards, now faced an array of
anti-slavery delegates that would not condone the Kansas outrages.
They would disapprove prohibition, commend Marcy's admirable foreign
policy, and praise the President's management of the exchequer; but
they would not countenance border ruffianism, encourage slavery
propagandists in Kansas, or submit to the extension of slavery in the
free territories. It was a stormy convention. For three days the
contest raged; but when final action was taken, although the platform
did not in terms censure Pierce's administration, it condemned the
Kansas outrages which the President had approved by the removal of
Governor Reeder, and disapproved the extension of slavery into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.211" id="Page_ii.211">ii. 211</a></span> free
territories. Among the candidates nominated were Samuel J. Tilden for
attorney-general, and Samuel L. Selden of Rochester for judge of the
Court of Appeals. Selden, who had been a district judge since 1847,
was also nominated by the Hards.</p>

<p>The Kansas disclosures had the effect of drawing into closer communion
the various shades of anti-slavery opinion in New York. Early in the
summer, the question was earnestly considered of enlisting all men
opposed to the aggressions of slavery under the banner of the
Republican party, a political organisation formed, as has been stated,
at Jackson, Michigan, on July 6, 1854. Horace Greeley had suggested
the name &quot;Republican&quot; as an unobjectionable one for the new party;
and, within a week after its adoption at Jackson, it became the name
of the Free-soilers who marshalled in Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois,
Vermont, and Massachusetts. The anti-Nebraska convention of New York,
which reassembled in Auburn on the 27th of September, 1854, also
adopted the name, calling its executive committee &quot;the Republican
state committee.&quot; It was not a new name in the Empire State. Voters in
middle life had all been Republicans in their early years; and long
after the formation of the National Republicans in 1828, and of the
Whig party in 1834, the designation had been used with approval by the
Regency. In 1846, Silas Wright spoke of belonging to &quot;the Republican
party;&quot; and, in 1848, Horace Greeley suggested &quot;Taylor Republicans&quot; as
a substitute for Whigs. But for twenty years the name had practically
fallen into disuse, and old questions associated with it had died out
of popular memory.</p>

<p>After full conferences between the Whig and Republican state
committees, calls were issued for two state conventions to meet at
Syracuse on September 26. This meant an opportunity for the formal
union of all anti-slavery voters. Of the two hundred and fifty-six
delegates allotted to the Republican convention, over two hundred
assembled, with Reuben E. Fenton as their presiding officer. Fenton,
then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.212" id="Page_ii.212">ii. 212</a></span> thirty-six years old, was serving his first term in Congress. He
was a man of marked intellectual vigour, unquestioned courage, and
quiet courtesy, whose ability to control men was to give him, within a
few years, something of the influence possessed by Thurlow Weed as a
managing politician, with this difference, perhaps, that Fenton
trusted more to the prevalence of ideas for which he stood. He kept
step with progress. His reason for being a Barnburner, unlike that of
John A. Dix,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> grew out of an intense hatred of slavery, and after
the historic break in 1847, he never again, with full-heartedness,
co-operated with the Democratic party. Fenton studied law, and, for a
time, practised at the bar, but if the dream and highest ambition of
his youth were success in the profession, his natural love for trade
and politics quickly gained the ascendant. It is doubtful if he would
have become a leading lawyer even in his own vicinage, for he showed
little real capacity for public speaking. Indeed, he was rather a dull
talker. The <i>Globe</i>, during his ten years in Congress, rarely reveals
him as doing more than making or briefly sustaining a motion, and,
although these frequently occurred at the most exciting moments of
partisan discussion, showing that he was carefully watching, if not
fearlessly directing affairs, it is evident that for the hard blows in
debate he relied as much as Weed did upon the readiness of other
speakers.</p>

<p>The Whigs, who had represented only a meagre minority of the voters of
the State since the Know-Nothing defection, now responded to the call
with a full quota of delegates, and elected John A. King president.
King was nearly double the age of Fenton. He had been a lieutenant of
cavalry in the War of 1812 and an opponent of DeWitt Clinton in the
early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.213" id="Page_ii.213">ii. 213</a></span> twenties. The two men presented a broad contrast, yet King
represented the traditions of the past along the same lines that
Fenton represented the hopes of the future. One looked his full age,
the other appeared younger than he was, but both were serious.
Whatever their aspirations, they existed without rivalry or
ill-feeling, the desire for the success of their principles alone
animating leaders and followers.</p>

<p>Each convention organised separately, and, after adopting platforms
and dividing their tickets equally between men of Whig and Democratic
antecedents, conference committees of sixteen were appointed, which
reported that the two bodies should appoint committees of sixteen on
resolutions and of thirty-two on nominations. These committees having
quickly agreed to what had already been done, the Whigs marched in a
body to the hall of the Republican convention, the delegates rising
and greeting them with cheers and shouts of welcome as they took the
seats reserved for them in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>The occasion was one of profound rejoicing. The great coalition which
was to stand so strong and to work such wonders during the next
half-century doubtless had a period of feebleness in the first months
of its existence; but never in its history has it had stronger or more
influential men in its ranks, or abler and more determined leaders to
direct its course. Horace Greeley reported its platform, demanding
that Congress expressly prohibit slavery in the territories, and
condemning the doctrines and methods of the Know-Nothings; John A.
King, Edwin D. Morgan, and Reuben E. Fenton, destined to lead it to
victory as its candidate for governor, sat upon the stage; Henry J.
Raymond occupied a delegate's seat; and, back of the scenes, stood the
great manager, Thurlow Weed, who had conferred with the Free-soil
leaders, and anticipated and arranged every detail. Present in spirit,
though absent in body, was William H. Seward, who, within a few weeks,
put himself squarely at the head of the new organisation in a speech
that was read by more than half a million voters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.214" id="Page_ii.214">ii. 214</a></span></p>

<p>After the enthusiasm had subsided the two chairmen, John A. King and
Reuben E. Fenton, standing side by side, called the joint convention
to order. This was the signal for more cheering. One delegate declared
that not being quite sure which convention he ought to attend, he had
applied to Seward, who wrote him it didn't make any difference. &quot;You
will go in by two doors, but you will all come out through one.&quot; Then
everything went by acclamation. Speaker Littlejohn of the Assembly
moved that the two conventions ratify the platforms passed by each
convention; Elbridge G. Spaulding moved that the presidents of the two
conventions appoint a state central committee; and John A. King moved
that the names of the candidates, at the head of whom was Preston King
for secretary of state, be given to the people of the State as the
&quot;Republican Ticket.&quot; Only when an effort was made to procure the
indorsement of liquor prohibition did the convention show its teeth.
The invitation, it was argued, included all men who were disposed to
unite in resisting the aggressions and the diffusion of slavery, and a
majority, by a ringing vote, declared it bad faith to insist upon a
matter for which the convention was not called and upon which it was
not unanimous.</p>

<p>The Know-Nothing state convention met at Auburn on September 26. It
was no longer a secret society. The terrors surrounding its mysterious
machinery had vanished with the exposure of its secrets and the
exploiting of its methods. It was now holding open political
conventions and adopting political platforms under the title of the
American party; and, as in other political organisations, the slavery
question provoked hot controversies and led to serious breaks in its
ranks. At its national council, held at Philadelphia in the preceding
June, the New York delegation, controlled by the Silver-Gray faction
which forced Daniel Ullman's nomination for governor in 1854, had
joined the Southern delegates in carrying a pro-slavery resolution
abandoning further efforts to restore the Missouri Compromise. In this
action the anti-slavery members of other Northern States, led with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.215" id="Page_ii.215">ii. 215</a></span>
great ability and courage by Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, refused to
acquiesce, preferring to abandon the Order rather than sacrifice their
principles. The contest in New York was renewed at the state council,
held at Binghamton on August 28; and, after a bitter session, a
majority resolved that slavery should derive no extension from the
repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The convention at Auburn now took
similar ground. It was not a great victory for the anti-slavery wing
of the party; but it disproved the assurances of their delegates that
the Americans of New York would uphold the pro-slavery action at
Philadelphia, while the fervent heat of the conflict melted the zeal
of thousands of anti-Nebraska Know-Nothings, who soon found their way
into the Republican party.</p>

<p>But the main body of the Americans, crushed as were its hopes of
national unity, was still powerful. It put a ticket into the field,
headed by Joel T. Headley for secretary of state, and greatly
strengthened by George F. Comstock of Syracuse for judge of the Court
of Appeals. Headley was a popular and prolific writer. He had been
educated for the ministry at Union College and Auburn Theological
Seminary, but his pen paid better than the pulpit, and he soon settled
down into a writer of melodramatic biography, of which <i>Napoleon and
His Marshals</i> attained, perhaps, the greatest popularity. Possibly
little interest now clings to his books, which ordinarily rest on the
high shelf with Abbott's <i>History of Napoleon</i>; but, in their day, it
was far pleasanter to read the entertaining and dramatic pages of
Headley, with their impassioned, stirring pictures of war and heroism,
than the tame, tedious biographies that then filled the libraries.
Headley's <i>History of the War of 1812</i> immediately preceded his
entrance to the Assembly in 1854, where his cleverness attracted the
attention of his party and led to his selection for secretary of
state. George F. Comstock, now in his forty-first year, had already
won an enviable reputation at the Onondaga bar. Like Headley he was a
graduate of Union College. In 1847, Governor Young had appointed him
the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.216" id="Page_ii.216">ii. 216</a></span> reporter for the Court of Appeals, and five years later
President Fillmore made him solicitor of the Treasury Department. He
belonged to the Hards, but he sympathised with the tenets of the young
American party.</p>

<p>There were other parties in the field. The Free Democracy met in
convention on August 7, and the Liberty party, assembling at Utica on
September 12, nominated Frederick Douglass of Monroe, then a young
coloured man of thirty-eight, for secretary of state, and Lewis Tappan
of New York for comptroller. Douglass' life had been full of romance.
Neither his white father nor coloured mother appears to have had any
idea of the prodigy they brought into the world; but it is certain his
Maryland master discovered in the little slave boy the great talents
that a hard life in Baltimore could not suppress. Douglass secretly
began teaching himself to read and write before he was ten years of
age, and three years after his escape from slavery at the age of
twenty-one, he completely captured an audience at an anti-slavery
convention in Nantucket by his brilliant speaking. This gave him
employment as an agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and
four years later brought him crowded audiences, in England, Scotland,
and Ireland.</p>

<p>Frederick Douglass was a favourite everywhere. He had wit and humour,
and spoke with the refinement of a cultivated scholar. He did not
become a narrow and monotonous agitator. The variety of his
intellectual sympathies, controlled by the constancy of a high moral
impulse, wholly exempted him from the rashness of a conceited zealot;
and, though often brilliant and at times rhetorical, his style was
quiet and persuasive, reaching the reason as easily as the emotions.
Coming as he did, out of slavery, at a time when the anti-slavery
sentiment was beginning to be aggressive and popular in New England
and other free States, Douglass seemed to be the Moses of his race as
much as Booker T. Washington in these later years. Englishmen raised
one hundred and fifty pounds and bought his freedom in 1846. The next
year, as a Garrisonian disunionist, he began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.217" id="Page_ii.217">ii. 217</a></span> publication of a
weekly journal in Rochester; but he soon renounced disunionism,
maintaining that slavery was illegal and unconstitutional. In the year
the Liberty party nominated him for secretary of state, his publishers
sold eighteen thousand copies of his autobiography, entitled <i>My
Bondage and My Freedom</i>.</p>

<p>Before the campaign was far advanced it became evident that the
Republican party was not drawing all the anti-slavery elements to
which it was thought to be entitled; and, on the 12th of October,
Seward made a speech in Albany, answering the question, &quot;Shall we form
a new party?&quot; The hall was little more than two-thirds filled, and an
absence of joyous enthusiasm characterised the meeting. Earnest men
sat with serious faces, thinking of party ties severed and the work of
a lifetime apparently snuffed out, with deep forebodings for the
future of the new organisation. This was a time to appeal to
reason&#8212;not to the emotions, and Seward met it squarely with a
storehouse of arguments. He sketched the history of slavery's growth
as a political power; he explained that slave-holders were a
privileged class, getting the better of the North in appropriations
and by the tariff. &quot;Protection is denied to your wool,&quot; he said,
&quot;while it is freely given to their sugar.&quot; Then he pointed out how
slavery had grasped the territories as each one presented itself for
admission into the Union&#8212;Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and
Alabama, almost at the very outset of the national career; then
Florida, when acquired from Spain; then as much of the Louisiana
Purchase as possible; then Texas and the territory acquired from
Mexico&#8212;all the while deluding the North with the specious pretence
that each successive seizure of free soil was a &quot;compromise&quot; and a
final settlement of the slavery question. This opened the way to the
matter in hand&#8212;how to meet slavery's aggressiveness. &quot;Shall we take
the American party?&quot; he asked. &quot;It stifles its voice, and suppresses
your own free speech, lest it may be overheard beyond the Potomac. In
the slave-holding States it justifies all wrongs committed against
you. Shall we unite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.218" id="Page_ii.218">ii. 218</a></span> ourselves to the Democratic party? If so, to
which faction? The Hards who are so stern in defending the
aggressions, and in rebuking the Administration through whose agency
they are committed? or the Softs who protest against the aggressions,
while they sustain and invigorate the Administration? What is it but
the same party which has led in the commission of all those
aggressions, and claims exclusively the political benefits? Shall we
report ourselves to the Whig party? Where is it? It was a strong and
vigorous party, honourable for energy, noble achievement, and still
more noble enterprises. It was moved by panics and fears to emulate
the Democratic party in its practised subserviency; and it yielded in
spite of your remonstrances, and of mine, and now there is neither
Whig party nor Whig south of the Potomac. Let, then, the Whig party
pass. It committed a grievous fault, and grievously hath it answered
it. Let it march off the field, therefore, with all the honours....
The Republican organisation has laid a new, sound, and liberal
platform. Its principles are equal and exact justice; its speech open,
decided, and frank. Its banner is untorn in former battles, and
unsullied by past errors. That is the party for us.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>When the meeting ended the people went out satisfied. The smallness of
the audience had been forgotten in the clear, homely arguments, and in
the glow kindled in every heart; nor did they know that the speech
spoken in their hearing would be read and pondered by half a million
voters within a month. Richard H. Dana pronounced it &quot;the keynote of
the new party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> But though sown in fruitful soil, insufficient
time was to elapse before election for such arguments to root and
blossom; and when the votes were counted in November, the
Know-Nothings had polled 146,001, the Republicans 135,962, the Softs
90,518, and the Hards 58,394. Samuel L. Selden, the candidate of the
Hards and Softs for judge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.219" id="Page_ii.219">ii. 219</a></span> the Court of Appeals, had 149,702.
George F. Comstock was also declared elected, having received 141,094,
or nearly 5000 less than Headley for secretary of state. In the
Assembly the Republicans numbered 44, the Know-Nothings 39, and the
Hards and Softs 45.</p>

<p>&quot;The events of the election,&quot; wrote Seward, &quot;show that the
Silver-Grays have been successful in a new and attractive form, so as
to divide a majority of the people in the cities and towns from the
great question of the day. That is all. The rural districts still
remain substantially sound. A year is necessary to let the cheat wear
off.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> To a friend who was greatly alarmed at the success of the
Know-Nothings, he wrote: &quot;There is just so much gas in any ascending
balloon. Before the balloon is down, the gas must escape. But the
balloon is always sure not only to come down, but to come down <i>very
quick</i>. The heart of the country is fixed on higher and nobler things.
Do not distrust it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>After the election, some people held the opinion that the prospect of
a united anti-slavery party was not so favourable as it had been at
the close of 1854; and men were inclined then, as some historians are
now, to criticise Seward for not forcing the formation of the
Republican party in New York in 1854 and putting himself at its head
by making speeches in New England and the West as well as in New York.
&quot;Had Seward sunk the politician in the statesman,&quot; says Rhodes; &quot;had
he vigorously asserted that every cause must be subordinate to Union
under the banner of opposition to the extension of slavery&#8212;the close
of the year would have seen a triumphant Republican party in every
Northern State but California, and Seward its acknowledged leader. It
was the tide in Seward's affairs, but he did not take it at the
flood.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.220" id="Page_ii.220">ii. 220</a></span></p>
<p>Looking back into the fifties from the viewpoint of the present, this
suggestion of the distinguished historian seems plausible. Undoubtedly
Thurlow Weed's judgment controlled in 1854, and back of it was thirty
years of successful leadership, based upon the sagacity of a statesman
as well as the skill of a clever politician. It was inevitable that
Weed should be a Republican. He had opposed slavery before he was of
age. The annexation of Texas met his strenuous resistance, the Wilmot
Proviso had his active approval, and he assailed the fugitive slave
law and the Nebraska Act with unsparing bitterness. With a singleness
of purpose, not excelled by Seward or Sumner, his heart quickly
responded to every movement which should limit, and, if possible,
abolish slavery; but, in his wisdom, with Know-Nothings recruiting
members from the anti-slavery ranks, and the Whig party confident of
success because of a divided Democracy, he did not see his way safely
to organise the Republican party in New York in 1854. It is possible
his desire to re-elect Seward to the United States Senate may have
increased his caution. Seward's re-election was just then a very
important factor in the successful coalition of the anti-slavery
elements of the Empire State. Besides, Weed knew very well that defeat
would put the work of coalition into unfriendly hands, and it might be
disastrous if a hostile majority were allowed to deal with it
according to their own designs and their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.221" id="Page_ii.221">ii. 221</a></span> class interests.
Nevertheless, his delay in organising and Seward's failure to lead the
new party in 1854, left an indelible impression to their injury in the
West, if not in New York and New England, &quot;for unto whomsoever much is
given, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have committed
much, of him they will ask the more.&quot;</p>

<br />
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR<br />
<br />
1856</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Kansas</span> troubles did not subside after the election. The Pierce
administration found itself harassed by the most formidable opposition
it had yet encountered. Reeder was out of the way for the moment; but
the Northern settlers, by planning a flank movement which included the
organisation of a state government and an appeal to Congress for
admission to the Union, proved themselves an enemy much more
pertinacious and ingenious than the removed Governor. To aid them in
their endeavour, friends sent a supply of Sharpe's rifles, marked
&quot;books.&quot; Accordingly, on the 9th of October, 1855, delegates were
elected to a convention which met at Topeka on the 23d of the same
month and framed a Constitution prohibiting slavery and providing for
its submission to the people.</p>

<p>This practically established a second government. Governor Shannon,
the successor of Reeder, recognised the action of the fraudulently
chosen territorial Legislature, while the free-state settlers, with
headquarters at Lawrence, repudiated its laws and resisted their
enforcement. Things could not long remain in this unhappy condition,
and when, at last, a free-state man was killed it amounted to a
declaration of hostilities. Immediately, the people of Lawrence threw
up earthworks; the Governor called out the militia; and the
Missourians again crossed the border. By the 1st of December a couple
of regiments were encamped in the vicinity of Lawrence, behind whose
fortifications calmly rested six hundred men, half of them armed with
Sharpe's rifles. A howitzer added to their confidence. Finally, the
border ruffians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.223" id="Page_ii.223">ii. 223</a></span> who had heard of the breech-loading rifles and
learned of the character of the men behind them, after dallying for
several weeks, recrossed the river and permitted the settlers to
ratify the new Constitution. In January, 1856, a governor and
legislature were chosen, and, in February, the Legislature, meeting at
Topeka, memorialised Congress, asking that Kansas be admitted into the
Union. Thereupon, Senator Douglas reported a bill providing that
whenever the people of Kansas numbered 93,420 inhabitants they might
organise a State. Instantly, Senator Seward offered a substitute,
providing for its immediate admission with the Topeka Constitution.</p>

<p>The events leading up to this parliamentary situation had been noisy
and murderous, rekindling a spirit of indignation in the South as well
as in the North, which brought out fiery appeals from the press. The
Georgia Legislature proposed to appropriate sixty thousand dollars to
aid emigration to Kansas. A chivalrous colonel of Alabama who issued
an appeal for three hundred men willing to fight for the cause of the
South, began his march from Montgomery with two hundred, having first
received a blessing from a Methodist minister and a Bible from a
divine of the Baptist church. One young lady of South Carolina set the
example of selling her jewelry to equip men with rifles. The same
spirit manifested itself in the North. Public meetings encouraged
armed emigration. &quot;The duty of the people of the free States,&quot; said
the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;is to send more true men, more Sharpe's rifles, and
more howitzers to Kansas.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> William Cullen Bryant wrote his
brother that &quot;by the 1st of May there will be several thousand more
free-state settlers in Kansas. Of course they will go well
armed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Henry Ward Beecher, happening to be present at a meeting
in which an orthodox deacon who had enlisted seventy-nine emigrants
asked for more rifles, declared that a Sharpe's rifle was a greater
moral agency than the Bible, and that if half the guns needed were
pledged on the spot Plymouth Church would furnish the rest.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.224" id="Page_ii.224">ii. 224</a></span> the equipment of Northern emigrants to Kansas became known as
&quot;Beecher's Bibles.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Henry J. Raymond said that &quot;the question of
slavery domination must be fought out on the plains of Kansas.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
To add to Northern bitterness, President Pierce, in a special message
to the United State Senate, condemned the emigrant aid societies,
threatening to call out the army, and approving the acts of the
pro-slavery Legislature.</p>

<p>In the midst of this excitement, Senator Douglas began the debate on
his Kansas bill which was destined to become more historic than the
outrages of the border ruffians themselves. Douglas upheld the acts of
the territorial Legislature as the work of law and order, denouncing
the Northern emigrants as daring and defiant revolutionists, and
charging that &quot;the whole responsibility for all the disturbance rested
upon the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company and its affiliated
societies.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Horace Greeley admitted the force and power of
Douglas' argument, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, the gifted author of
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, was so profoundly impressed with the matchless
orator that she thought it &quot;a merciful providence that with all his
alertness and adroitness, all his quick-sighted keenness, Douglas is
not witty&#8212;that might have made him too irresistible a demagogue for
the liberties of our laughter-loving people, to whose weakness he is
altogether too well adapted now.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The friends of a free Kansas
appreciated the superiority in debate of the Illinois statesman, whose
arguments now called out half a dozen replies from as many Republican
senators. It afforded a fine opportunity to define and shape the
principles of the new party, and each senator attracted wide
attention. But the speech of Seward, who took the floor on the 9th of
April in favour of the immediate admission of Kansas as a State, seems
to have impressed the country as far the ablest. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.225" id="Page_ii.225">ii. 225</a></span> sketched the
history of the Kansas territory; reviewed the sacrifices of its
people; analysed and refuted each argument in support of the
President's policy; and defended the settlers in maintaining their
struggle for freedom. &quot;Greeley expressed the opinion of the country
and the judgment of the historian,&quot; says Rhodes, &quot;when he wrote to his
journal that Seward's speech was 'the great argument' and stood
'unsurpassed in its political philosophy.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The <i>Times</i>
pronounced it &quot;the ablest of all his speeches.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> On the day of its
publication the <i>Weekly Tribune</i> sent out 162,000 copies. Seward wrote
Weed that &quot;the demand for it exceeds what I have ever known. I am
giving copies away by the thousand for distribution in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and other States.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>A month later, on the 19th and 20th of May, came the speech of Charles
Sumner, entitled &quot;The Crime Against Kansas.&quot; Whittier called it &quot;a
grand and terrible philippic.&quot; Sumner had read it to Senator and Mrs.
Seward, who advised the omission of certain personal allusions to
Senator Butler;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> but he delivered it as he wrote it, and two days
later the country was startled by Preston S. Brooks' assault. The
North received this outrage with horror as the work of the slave
power. In public meetings, the people condemned it as a violation of
the freedom of speech and a blow at the personal safety of public men
having the courage to express their convictions. &quot;The blows that fell
on the head of the Senator from Massachusetts,&quot; said Seward, &quot;have
done more for the cause of human freedom in Kansas and in the
territories of the United States than all the eloquence which has
resounded in these halls since the days of Rufus King and John Quincy
Adams.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The events surrounding the assault&#8212;Brooks' resignation,
his unanimous re-election, his challenge to Burlingame, and his
refusal to fight in Canada&#8212;all tended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.226" id="Page_ii.226">ii. 226</a></span> to intensify Northern feeling.
Close upon the heels of this excitement came news from Kansas of the
burning of Lawrence, the destruction of Osawatomie, the sacking of
free-state printing offices, and the murder of Northern immigrants. To
complete the list of crimes against free speech and freedom, the
commander of a force of United States troops dispersed the Topeka
Legislature at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>This was the condition of affairs when the two great political parties
of the country assembled in national convention in June, 1856, to
select candidates for President and Vice President. At their state
convention, in January, to select delegates-at-large to Cincinnati,
the Softs had put themselves squarely in accord with the pro-slavery
wing of their party. They commended the administration of Pierce,
approved the Nebraska Act, and denounced as &quot;treasonable&quot; the Kansas
policy of the Republican party. This was a wide departure from their
position of August, 1855, which had practically reaffirmed the
principles of the Wilmot Proviso; but the trend of public events
compelled them either to renounce all anti-slavery leanings or abandon
their party. Their surrender, however, did not turn their reception at
Cincinnati into the welcome of prodigals. The committee on credentials
kept them waiting at the door for two days, and when they were finally
admitted they were compelled to enter on an equality with the Hards.
Horatio Seymour pleaded for representation in proportion to the votes
cast, which would have given the Softs three-fifths of the delegation,
but the convention thought them entitled to no advantages because of
their &quot;abolition principles,&quot; and even refused a request for
additional seats from which their colleagues might witness the
proceedings. To complete their humiliation the convention required
them formally to deny the right of Congress or of the people of a
territory to prohibit slavery in any territory of the United States.
It was a bitter dose. The Democracy of the Empire State had been
accustomed to control conventions&#8212;not to serve them. For twenty years
they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.227" id="Page_ii.227">ii. 227</a></span> come with candidates for the Presidency, and if none of
their statesmen had been nominated since 1836 they were recognised as
resolute men, bold in diplomacy, ready for any emergency, and as
formidable to their enemies as they were dear to their friends. For
nearly three decades a New Yorker had been in the Cabinet of every
administration. But the glory of former days had now departed. For
twelve years the party had been divided and weakened, until, at last,
it had neither presidential candidate to offer nor cabinet position to
expect.</p>

<p>The leading candidates at Cincinnati were Franklin Pierce, Stephen A.
Douglas, and James Buchanan. Northern delegates had been inclined to
support Pierce or Douglas; but since the assault upon Sumner and the
destruction of Lawrence, the conciliation of the North by the
nomination of a candidate who had not participated in the events of
the past three years seemed the wisest and safest policy. Buchanan had
been minister to England since the birth of the Pierce administration;
and the fact that he hailed from Pennsylvania, a very important State
in the election, strengthened his availability. The Softs recognised
the wisdom of this philosophy, but, under the leadership of Marcy, who
had given them the federal patronage for three years, they voted for
the President, with the hope that his supporters might ultimately
unite with those of Douglas. The Hards, on the contrary, supported
Buchanan. They had little use for Pierce, who had persecuted them.</p>

<p>On the first ballot Buchanan had 135 votes, Pierce 122, Douglas 33,
and Cass 5, with 197 necessary to a choice. This made Buchanan's
success probable if his forces stood firm; and as other ballots
brought him additional votes at the expense of Pierce, his nomination
seemed certain. The Softs, however, continued with Pierce until his
withdrawal on the fourteenth ballot; then, putting aside an
opportunity to support the winning candidate, they turned to Douglas.
But to their great surprise, Douglas withdrew at the end of the next
ballot, leaving the field to Buchanan. This placed the Softs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.228" id="Page_ii.228">ii. 228</a></span> who now
joined the Hards because there was no longer any way of keeping apart,
in an awkward position. Seymour, however, gracefully accepted the
situation, declaring that, although the Softs came into the convention
under many disadvantages, they desired to do all in their power to
harmonise the vote of the convention and to promote the discontinuance
of factional differences in the great State of New York. Greene C.
Bronson, who smiled derisively as he heard this deathbed repentance,
did not know how soon Horatio Seymour was destined again to command
the party.</p>

<p>The Republican national convention convened at Philadelphia on the
17th of June. Recent events had encouraged Republicans with the hope
of ultimate victory. Nathaniel P. Banks' election as speaker of the
national House of Representatives on the one hundred and
thirty-seventh ballot, after a fierce contest of two months, was a
great triumph; interest in the Pittsburg convention on the 22d of
February had surpassed expectations; and the troubles of &quot;bleeding
Kansas,&quot; which seemed to culminate in the assault upon Sumner and the
destruction of Lawrence, had kept the free States in a condition of
profound excitement. Such brutal outrages, it was thought, would
certainly discredit any party that approved the policy leading to
them. Sustained by this hope the convention, in its platform,
arraigned the Administration for the conduct of affairs; demanded the
immediate admission of Kansas into the Union under the Topeka
Constitution; and resolved, amidst the greatest enthusiasm, that &quot;it
is both the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories
those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.&quot;</p>

<p>The selection of a presidential candidate gave the delegates more
trouble. They wanted an available man who could carry Pennsylvania;
and between the supporters of John C. Fremont and the forces of John
McLean, for twenty-six years a member of the United States Supreme
Court, the canvass became earnest and exciting. Finally, on an
informal ballot, Fremont secured 359 of the 555 votes in the
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.229" id="Page_ii.229">ii. 229</a></span>vention. William L. Dayton of New Jersey was then nominated for
Vice President over Abraham Lincoln, who received 110 votes.</p>

<p>William H. Seward was the logical candidate for President. He
represented Republican principles and aims more fully than any man in
the country, but Thurlow Weed, looking into the future through the
eyes of a practical politician, disbelieved in Republican success. He
argued that, although Republicans were sure of 114 electoral votes, it
was essential to carry Pennsylvania to secure the additional 35, and
that Pennsylvania could not be carried. This belief was strengthened
after the nomination of Buchanan, who pledged himself to give fair
play to Kansas, which many understood to mean a free State. Under
these conditions Weed advised Seward not to become a candidate, on the
theory that defeat in 1856 would sacrifice his chances in 1860.</p>

<p>Seward, as usual, acquiesced in Weed's judgment. &quot;I once heard Seward
declare,&quot; wrote Gideon Welles, &quot;that 'Seward is Weed and Weed is
Seward. What I do, Weed approves. What he says, I indorse. We are
one.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> On this occasion, however, it is certain Seward accepted
Weed's judgment with much reluctance. His heart was set upon the
nomination, and his letters reveal disappointment and even disgust at
the arrangement. &quot;It is a delicate thing,&quot; he wrote, on the 27th of
April, &quot;to go through the present ordeal, but I am endeavouring to do
so without giving any one just cause to complain of indifference on my
part to the success of the cause. I have shut out the subject itself
from conversation and correspondence, and, so far as possible, from my
thoughts.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> But he could not close his ears. &quot;From all I hear
'availability' is to be indulged next week and my own friends are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.230" id="Page_ii.230">ii. 230</a></span> to
make the sacrifice,&quot; he wrote his wife, on June 11, six days before
the convention opened. &quot;Be it so; I shall submit with better grace
than others would.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Two days later he said: &quot;It tries my patience
to hear what is said and to act as if I assented, under expectation of
personal benefits, present and prospective.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>What especially gravelled Seward was the action of his opponents. &quot;The
understanding all around me is,&quot; he wrote his wife, on June 14, &quot;that
Greeley has struck hands with enemies of mine and sacrificed me for
the good of the cause, to be obtained by the nomination of a more
available candidate, and that Weed has concurred in demanding my
acquiescence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Seward suspected the truth of this &quot;understanding&quot;
as to Greeley, but it is doubtful if he then believed Weed had
betrayed him. Perhaps this thought came later after he heard of
Fremont's astonishing vote and learned that the newspapers were again
nominating the Path-finder for a standard-bearer in 1860. &quot;Seward more
than hinted to confidential friends,&quot; wrote Henry B. Stanton, &quot;that
Weed betrayed him for Fremont.&quot; Then Stanton tells the story of Weed
and Seward riding up Broadway, and how, when passing the bronze statue
of Lincoln in Union Square, Seward said, &quot;Weed, if you had been
faithful to me, I should have been there instead of Lincoln.&quot;
&quot;Seward,&quot; replied Weed, &quot;is it not better to be alive in a carriage
with me than to be dead and set up in bronze?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>How much Weed's advice to Seward was influenced by the arguments of
opponents nowhere appears, but the disappointment of Democrats and
conservative Americans upon the announcement of Seward's withdrawal
proves that these objections were serious. His views were regarded as
too extreme for a popular candidate. It was deemed advisable not to
put in issue either the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia, or the repeal of the fugitive slave law, and Seward's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.231" id="Page_ii.231">ii. 231</a></span>
pronounced attitude on these questions, it was asserted, would involve
them in the campaign regardless of the silence of the platform. It was
argued, also, that although the Whigs were numerically the largest
portion of the Republican party, a candidate of Democratic antecedents
would be preferable, especially in Pennsylvania, a State, they
declared, which Seward could not carry. To all this Greeley
undoubtedly assented. The dissolution of the firm of Seward, Weed, and
Greeley, announced in Greeley's remarkable letter of November 11,
1854, but not yet made public, had, indeed, taken effect. The result
was not so patent, certainly not so vitriolic, as it appeared at
Chicago in 1860, but Greeley now began insinuating doubts of Seward's
popular strength, exaggerating local prejudices against him, and
yielding to objections raised by his avowed opponents. His hostility
found no place in the columns of the <i>Tribune</i>, but it coloured his
conversations and private correspondence. To Richard A. Dana he wrote
that Callamer's speech on the Kansas question &quot;is better than
Seward's, in my humble judgment;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> yet the <i>Tribune</i> pronounced
Seward's &quot;the great argument&quot; and &quot;unsurpassed in political
philosophy.&quot; The importance of Pennsylvania became as prominent a
factor in the convention of 1856 as it did in that of 1860, and
Greeley did not hesitate to affirm Seward's inability to carry it,
declaring that such weakness made his nomination fatal to party
success.</p>

<p>The opponents of Seward, however, could not have prevented his
nomination had he decided to enter the race. He was the unanimous
choice of the New York delegation. The mere mention of his name at
Philadelphia met with the loudest applause. When Senator Wilson of
Massachusetts spoke of him as &quot;the foremost American statesman,&quot; the
cheers made further speaking impossible for several minutes. He was
the idol of the convention as he was the chief figure of his party.
John A. King declared that could his name have been presented &quot;it
would have received the universal ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.232" id="Page_ii.232">ii. 232</a></span>probation of the convention.&quot;
Robert Emmet, the son of the distinguished Thomas Addis Emmet, and the
temporary chairman of the convention, made a similar statement. Even
Thurlow Weed found it difficult to prevail upon his friends to bide
their time until the next national convention. &quot;Earnest friends
refused to forego my nomination,&quot; Seward wrote his wife on June 17,
the day the convention opened, &quot;without my own authority.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>When the several state conventions convened at Syracuse each party
sought its strongest man for governor. The Hards and the Softs were
first in the field, meeting in separate conventions on July 30. After
inviting each other to join in a union meeting they reassembled as one
body, pledged to support the Cincinnati platform. It was not an
occasion for cheers. Consolidation was the only alternative, with
chances that the ultra pro-slavery platform meant larger losses if not
certain defeat. In this crisis Horatio Seymour assumed the leadership
that had been his in 1852, and that was not to be laid down for more
than a decade. Seymour was now in his prime&#8212;still under fifty years
of age. He had become a leader of energy and courage; and, although
destined for many years to lead a divided and often a defeated
organisation, he was ever after recognised as the most gifted and
notable member of his party. He was a typical Northern Democrat. He
had the virtues and foibles that belonged to that character in his
generation, the last of whom have now passed from the stage of public
action.</p>

<p>The effort to secure a Democratic nominee for governor required four
ballots. Addison Gardiner, David L. Seymour, Fernando Wood, and Amasa
J. Parker were the leading candidates. David Seymour had been a steady
supporter of the Hards. He belonged to the O'Conor type of
conservatives, rugged and stalwart, who seemed unmindful of the
changing conditions in the political growth of the country. At
Cincinnati, he opposed the admission of the Softs as an unjust and
utterly irrational disqualification of the Hards, who, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.233" id="Page_ii.233">ii. 233</a></span> said, had
always stood firmly by party platforms and party nominations
regardless of personal convictions. Fernando Wood belonged to a
different type.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> He had already developed those regrettable
qualities which gave him a most unsavoury reputation as mayor of New
York; but of the dangerous qualities that lay beneath the winning
surface of his gracious manner, men as yet knew nothing. Just now his
gubernatorial ambition, fed by dishonourable methods, found support in
a great host of noisy henchmen who demanded his nomination. Addison
Gardiner was the choice of the Softs. Gardiner had been elected
lieutenant-governor on the ticket with Silas Wright in 1844, and later
became an original member of the Court of Appeals, from which he
retired in 1855. He was a serious, simple-hearted, wise man, well
fitted for governor. But Horatio Seymour made up his mind that Parker,
although far below Gardiner and David L. Seymour in number of votes,
would better unite the convention, and upon Gardiner's withdrawal
Parker immediately received the nomination.</p>

<p>Amasa J. Parker was then forty-nine years of age, an eminent,
successful lawyer. Before his thirty-second birthday he had served
Delaware County as surrogate, district attorney, assemblyman, and
congressman. Later, he became a judge of the Supreme Court and removed
to Albany, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.234" id="Page_ii.234">ii. 234</a></span> he resided for forty-six years, until his death in
1890. Parker was a New England Puritan, who had been unusually well
raised. He passed from the study of his father, a Congregational
clergyman, to the senior class at Union College, graduating at
eighteen; and from his uncle's law library to the surrogate's office.
All his early years had been a training for public life. He had
associated with scholars and thinkers, and in the estimation of his
contemporaries there were few stronger or clearer intellects in the
State. But his later political career was a disappointment. His party
began nominating him for governor after it had fallen into the
unfortunate habit of being beaten, and, although he twice ran ahead of
his ticket, the anti-slavery sentiment that dominated New York after
1854 kept him out of the executive chair.</p>

<p>The Republican state convention assembled at Syracuse on the 17th of
September. A feeling existed that the election this year would extract
the people from the mire of Know-Nothingism, giving the State its
first Republican governor; and confidence of success, mingled with an
unusual desire to make no mistake, characterised the selection of a
nominee for chief executive. Myron H. Clark, a man of the people, had
made a good governor, but he was too heavily weighted with prohibition
to suit the older public men, who did not take kindly to him. They
turned to Moses H. Grinnell, whose pre-eminence as a large-hearted,
public-spirited merchant always kept him in sight. Grinnell was now
fifty-three years of age. His broad, handsome face showed an absence
of bigotry and intolerance, while the motives that controlled his life
were public and patriotic, not personal. Probably no man in New York
City, since the time John Jay left it, had ever had more admirers. He
was a favourite of Daniel Webster, who appointed Washington Irving
minister to Spain upon his request. This interest in the famous
author, as well as his recent promotion of Dr. Kane's expedition to
the Arctic seas in search of Sir John Franklin, indicated the broad
philanthropy that governed his well-ordered life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.235" id="Page_ii.235">ii. 235</a></span> But he declined to
accept office. The distinguished house that had borne his name for
twenty-seven years, decided that its senior member could not be
spared, even temporarily, to become governor of the State, and so
Grinnell's official life was limited to a single term in Congress,
although his public life may be said to have spanned nearly two-thirds
of his more than three score years and ten.</p>

<p>Grinnell's decision seemed to leave an open field, and upon the first
ballot John A. King received 91 votes, James S. Wadsworth 72, Simeon
Draper 23, Myron H. Clark 22, and Ira Harris 22. Thurlow Weed and the
wheel horses of Whig descent, however, preferring that the young party
have a governor of their own antecedents, familiar with political
difficulties and guided by firmness and wisdom, had secretly
determined upon King. But Wadsworth, although he quickly felt the
influence of their decision, declined to withdraw. Wadsworth was a
born fighter. In the Free-soil secession of 1847, he proclaimed
uncompromising hostility to the extension of slavery, and he never
changed his position until death ended his gallant and noble service
in the Civil War.</p>

<p>Wadsworth descended from a notable family. His father, James
Wadsworth, a graduate of Yale, leaving his Connecticut home in young
manhood, bought of the Dutch and of the Six Nations twenty thousand
acres in the Genesee Valley, and became one of the earliest settlers
and wealthiest men in Western New York. He was, also, the most
public-spirited citizen. He believed in normal schools and in district
school libraries, and he may properly be called one of the founders of
the educational system of the State. But he never cared for political
office. It was said of him that his refusal to accept public place was
as inflexible as his determination to fight Oliver Kane, a well-known
merchant of New York City, after trouble had occurred at the card
table. The story, told at the time, was that the two, after separating
in anger, met before sunrise the next morning, without seconds or
surgeons, under a tall pine tree on a bluff, and after politely
measuring the distance and taking their places, continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.236" id="Page_ii.236">ii. 236</a></span> shooting at
each other until Kane, slightly wounded, declared he had enough.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>James S. Wadsworth discovered none of his father's aversion to holding
office. He, also, graduated at Yale and studied law in the office of
Daniel Webster, but he preferred politics and agriculture to the
troubles of clients, and, although never successful in getting office,
all admitted his fitness for it. He was brave, far-sighted, and formed
to please. He had a handsome face and stately presence. Many people
who never saw him were strongly attracted to him by sympathy of
political opinions and by gratitude for important services rendered
the country. There was to come a time, in 1862, when these radical
friends, looking upon him as the Lord's Anointed, and indifferent to
the wishes of Thurlow Weed and the more conservative leaders, forced
his nomination for governor by acclamation; but, in 1856, John A. King
had the weightiest influence, and, on the second ballot, he took the
strength of Draper, Clark, and Harris, receiving 158 votes to 73 for
Wadsworth. It was not soon forgotten, however, that in the memorable
stampede for King, Wadsworth more than held his own.</p>

<p>John Alsop King was the eldest son of Rufus King. While the father was
minister to the court of St. James, the son attended the famous school
at Harrow, had as classmates Lord Byron and Sir Robert Peel, and went
the usual rounds of continental travel. For nearly four decades he had
been conspicuous in public life as assemblyman, senator, congressman,
and in the diplomatic service. Starting as a Federalist and an early
advocate of anti-slavery sentiments, he had been an Anti-Mason, a
National Republican, and a Whig. Only when he acted with Martin Van
Buren against DeWitt Clinton did he flicker in his political
consistency. Although now sixty-eight years old, he was still
rugged&#8212;a man of vigorous sense and great public spirit. His
congressional experience came when the hosts of slavery and freedom
were marshalling for the great contest for the territory between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.237" id="Page_ii.237">ii. 237</a></span> the
Mississippi and the Pacific, and at the side of Preston King he
resisted Clay's compromise measures, especially the fugitive slave
law, and warmly supported the admission of California as a free State.
&quot;I have come to have a great liking for the Kings,&quot; wrote Seward, in
1850. &quot;They have withstood the seduction of the seducers, and are like
a rock in the defence of the right. They have been tried as through
fire.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> John A. King was not ambitious for public place. He waited
to be called to an office, but he did not wait to be called to join a
movement which would be helpful to the public. His ear was to the sky
rather than to the ground. He believed Ralph Waldo Emerson's saying:
&quot;That is the one base thing in the universe, to receive benefits and
render none.&quot; Like his distinguished father, he was tolerant in
dealing with men who differed from him, but he never shrank from the
expression of an opinion because it would bring sacrifice or
ostracism.</p>

<p>The ticket was strengthened by the nomination of Henry R. Selden of
Monroe for lieutenant-governor. Selden belonged to a family that had
been prominent for two centuries in the Connecticut Valley. Like his
older brother, Samuel L. Selden, who lived at Rochester, he was an
able lawyer and a man of great industry. These brothers brought to the
service of the people a perfect integrity, coupled with a gracious
urbanity that kept them in public life longer than either desired to
remain. One was a Republican, the other a Democrat. Samuel became a
partner of Addison Gardiner in 1825, and Henry, after studying law
with them, opened an office at Clarkson in the western part of the
county. In 1851, Henry became reporter for the Court of Appeals, and
then, lieutenant-governor. Samuel's public service began earlier. He
became judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1831, of the Supreme
Court in 1847, and of the Court of Appeals in 1856. When he resigned
in 1862, Henry took his place by appointment, and afterward by
election. Finally, in 1865, he also resigned. The brothers were much
alike in the quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.238" id="Page_ii.238">ii. 238</a></span> they brought to the public service; and their
work, as remarkable for its variety as for its dignity, made Samuel an
original promoter of the electric telegraph system and Henry a
defender of Susan B. Anthony when arrested on the charge of illegally
voting at a presidential election.</p>

<p>The Americans nominated Erastus Brooks for governor. He was a younger
brother of James Brooks, who founded the New York <i>Express</i> in 1836.
The Brookses were born in Maine, and early exhibited the industry and
courage characteristic of the sons of the Pine Tree State. At eight
years of age, Erastus began work in a grocery store, fitting himself
for Brown University at a night school, and, at twenty, he became an
editor on his brother's paper. His insistence upon the taxation of
property of the Catholic Church, because, being held in the name of
the Bishops, it should be included under the laws governing personal
holdings in realty, brought him prominently before the Americans, who
sent him to the State Senate in 1854. But Brooks' political career,
like that of his brother, really began after the Civil War, although
his identification with the Know-Nothings marked him as a man of
force, capable of making strong friends and acquiring much influence.</p>

<p>The activity of the Americans indicated firm faith in their success.
Six months before Brooks' nomination they had named Millard Fillmore
for President. At the time, the former President was in Europe. On his
return he accepted the compliment and later received the indorsement
of the old-line Whigs. Age had not left its impress. Of imposing
appearance, he looked like a man formed to rule. The peculiar tenets
of the Americans, except as exemplified in the career of their
candidate for governor, did not enter into Fillmore's campaign. He
rested his hopes upon the conservative elements of all parties who
condemned the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and opposed the
formation of a party which, he declared, had, for the first time in
the history of the Republic, selected candidates for President and
Vice President from the free States alone, with the avowed purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.239" id="Page_ii.239">ii. 239</a></span>
electing them by the suffrages of one part of the Union to rule over
the other part.</p>

<p>This was also the argument of Buchanan. In his letter of acceptance he
sounded the keynote of his party, claiming that it was strictly
national, devoted to the Constitution and the Union, and that the
Republican party, ignoring the historic warning of Washington, was
formed on geographic lines.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> All this made little impression upon
the host of Northern men who exulted in the union of all the
anti-slavery elements. But their intense devotion to the positive
utterances of their platform took away the sense of humour which often
relieves the tension of political activity, and substituted an element
of profound seriousness that was plainly visible in speakers and
audiences. Seward did not hasten into the campaign. Richard H. Dana
wrote, confidentially, that &quot;Seward was awful grouty.&quot; It was October
2 when he began speaking. Congress had detained him until August 30,
and then his health was so impaired, it was explained, that he needed
rest. But other lovers of freedom were deeply stirred. The pulpit
became a platform, and the great edi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.240" id="Page_ii.240">ii. 240</a></span>tors spoke as well as wrote.
Henry Ward Beecher seemed ubiquitous; Greeley and Raymond made
extended tours through the State; Bryant was encouraged to overcome
his great timidity before an audience; and Washington Irving declared
his intention of voting, if not of speaking, for Fremont.</p>

<p>This campaign also welcomed into political life a young man whose
first speech made it plain that a new champion, with bright and
well-tempered sword, had taken up the cause of freedom with the
courage of the cavalier. George William Curtis was then thirty-two
years old. He had already written the Howadji books, which earned him
recognition among men of letters, and <i>Prue and I</i>, which had secured
his fame as an author. In the campaign of 1856, the people for the
first time saw and knew this man whose refined rhetoric, characterised
by tender and stirring appeal, and guided by principle and conviction,
was, thereafter, for nearly forty years, to be heard at its best on
one side of every important question that divided American political
life. Nathaniel P. Willis, who drove five miles in the evening to hear
him deliver a &quot;stump speech,&quot; thought Curtis would be &quot;too handsome
and too well dressed&quot; for a political orator; but when he heard him
unfold his logical argument step by step, occasionally bursting into a
strain of inspiring eloquence that foreshadowed the more studied work
of his riper years, it taught him that the author was as caustic and
unconstrained on the platform as he appeared in <i>The Potiphar Papers</i>.</p>

<p>Curtis' theme was resistance to the extension of slavery. His wife's
father, Francis G. Shaw, had stimulated his zeal in the cause of
freedom; and he treated the subject with a finish and strength that
came from larger experience and longer observation than a young man of
thirty-two could usually boast. To him, the struggle for freedom in
Kansas was not less glorious than the heroic resistance in 1776, and
he made it vivid by the use of historic associations. &quot;Through these
very streets,&quot; he said, &quot;they marched who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.241" id="Page_ii.241">ii. 241</a></span> never returned. They fell
and were buried, but they can never die. Not sweeter are the flowers
that make your valley fair, not greener are the pines that give your
valley its name, than the memory of the brave men who died for
freedom. And yet no victim of those days, sleeping under the green
sod, is more truly a martyr of Liberty than every murdered man whose
bones lie bleaching in this summer sun upon the silent plains of
Kansas. And so long as Liberty has one martyr, so long as one drop of
blood is poured out for her, so long from that single drop of bloody
sweat of the agony of humanity shall spring hosts as countless as the
forest leaves and mighty as the sea.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Curtis thought the question of endangering the Union a mere pretence.
&quot;Twenty millions of a moral people, politically dedicated to Liberty,
are asking themselves whether their government shall be administered
solely in the interest of three hundred and fifty thousand
slave-holders.&quot; He did not believe that these millions would dissolve
the Union in the interest of these thousands. &quot;I see a rising
enthusiasm,&quot; he said, in closing; &quot;but enthusiasm is not an election;
and I hear cheers from the heart, but cheers are not voters. Every man
must labour with his neighbour&#8212;in the street, at the plough, at the
bench, early and late, at home and abroad. Generally we are concerned
in elections with the measures of government. This time it is with the
essential principle of government itself.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The result of the election was not a surprise. Fremont's loss of
Pennsylvania and Indiana had been foreshadowed in October, making his
defeat inevitable, but the Republican victory in New York was more
sweeping than the leaders had anticipated, Fremont securing a majority
of 80,000 over Buchanan, and John A. King 65,000 over Amasa J.
Parker.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.242" id="Page_ii.242">ii. 242</a></span> The average vote was as follows: Republican, 266,328;
Democrat, 197,172; Know-Nothing, 129,750. West and north of Albany,
every congressman and nearly every assemblyman was a Republican.
Reuben E. Fenton, who had been beaten for Congress in 1854 by 1676
votes, was now elected by 8000 over the same opponent. The Assembly
stood 82 Republicans, 37 Democrats, and 8 Know-Nothings. In the
country at large, Buchanan obtained 174 electoral votes out of 296,
but he failed to receive a majority of the popular vote, leaving the
vanquished more hopeful and not less cheerful than the victors.
Fillmore received the electoral vote of Maryland and a popular vote of
874,534, nearly one-half as many as Buchanan and two-thirds as many as
Fremont. In other words, he had divided the vote of the North, making
it possible for Buchanan to carry Pennsylvania and Indiana.</p>

THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT<br />
<br />
1857-1858</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">It was</span> the duty of the Legislature of 1857 to elect a successor to
Hamilton Fish, whose term as United States senator expired on the 4th
of March. Fish had not been a conspicuous member of the Senate; but
his great wisdom brought him large influence at a time when slavery
strained the courtesy of that body. He was of a most gracious and
sweet nature, and, although he never flinched from uttering or
maintaining his opinions, he was a lover and maker of peace. In his
<i>Autobiography of Seventy Years</i>, Senator Hoar speaks of him as the
only man of high character and great ability among the leaders of the
Republican party, except President Grant, who retained the friendship
of Roscoe Conkling.</p>

<p>The contest over the senatorship brought into notice a disposition
among Republicans of Democratic antecedents not to act in perfect
accord with Thurlow Weed, a danger that leading Whigs had anticipated
at the formation of the party. Weed's management had been disliked by
anti-slavery Democrats as much as it had been distrusted by a portion
of the Whig party, and, although political associations now brought
them under one roof, they did not accept him as a guiding or
controlling spirit. This disposition manifested itself at the state
convention in the preceding September; and to allay any bitterness of
feeling which the nomination of John A. King might occasion, it was
provided that, in the event of success, the senator should be of
Democratic antecedents. The finger of fate then pointed to Preston
King. He had resisted the aggressions of the slave power, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.244" id="Page_ii.244">ii. 244</a></span>
formation of the Republican party his fearless fidelity to its
corner-stone principle made him doubly welcome in council; but when
the Legislature met, other aspirants appeared, prominent among whom
were Ward Hunt, James S. Wadsworth, and David Dudley Field.</p>

<p>Hunt, who was destined to occupy a place on the Court of Appeals, and,
subsequently, on the Supreme Court of the United States, had taken
little interest in politics. He belonged to the Democratic party, and,
in 1839, had served one term in the Assembly; but his consistent
devotion to Free-soilism, and his just and almost prescient
appreciation of the true principles of the Republican party, gave him
great prominence in the ranks of the young organisation and created a
strong desire to send him to the United States Senate. Hunt was
anxious and Wadsworth active. The latter's supporters, standing for
him as their candidate for governor, had forced the agreement of the
year before, and they now demanded that he become senator; but in the
interest of harmony, both finally withdrew in favour of David Dudley
Field.</p>

<p>The inspiration of an historic name did not yet belong to the Field
family. The projector of the Atlantic cable, the future justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and the eminent New York editor,
had not taken their places among the most gifted of the land, but
David Dudley's activity in the Free-soil contests had made him as
conspicuous a member of the new party as his celebrated Code of Civil
Procedure, passed by the Legislature of 1848, had distinguished him in
his profession. Promotion did not move his way, however. Thurlow Weed
insisted upon Preston King. It is likely the Albany editor had not
forgotten that Field, acting for George Opdyke, a millionaire client,
had sued him for libel, and that, although the jury disagreed, the
exciting trial had crowded the court-room for nineteen days and cost
seventeen thousand dollars; but Weed did not appeal to Field's record,
since he claimed the agreement at the state convention included John
A. King for governor and Preston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.245" id="Page_ii.245">ii. 245</a></span> King for senator, and to avoid
controversy he adroitly consented to leave the matter to Republican
legislators of Democratic antecedents, who decided in favour of King.
This ended the contest, the caucus giving King 65 votes and Hunt 17.</p>

<p>In 1857, events gave the Republican party little encouragement in New
York. Public interest in Kansas had largely died out, and, although
the Dred Scott decision, holding inferentially that the Constitution
carried with it the right and power to hold slaves everywhere, had
startled the nation, leading press, pulpit, and public meetings to
denounce it as a blow at the rights of States and to the rights of
man, yet the Democrats carried the State in November, electing Gideon
J. Tucker secretary of state, Sanford E. Church comptroller, Lyman
Tremaine attorney-general, and Hiram Denio to the Court of Appeals. It
was not a decisive victory. The Know-Nothings, who held the balance of
power, involuntarily contributed a large portion of their strength to
the Democratic party, giving it an aggregate vote of 194,000 to
175,000 for the Republicans, and reducing the vote of James O. Putnam,
of Buffalo, the popular American candidate for secretary of state, to
less than 67,000, or one-half the number polled in the preceding year.</p>

<p>Other causes contributed to the apparent decrease of Republican
strength. The financial disturbance of 1857 appeared with great
suddenness in August. There had been fluctuations in prices, with a
general downward tendency, but when the crisis came it was a surprise
to many of the most watchful financiers. Industry and commerce were
less affected than in 1837, but the failures, representing a larger
amount of capital than those of any other year in the history of the
country up to 1893, astonished the people, associating in the public
mind the Democratic charge of Republican extravagance with the general
cry of hard times.</p>

<p>But whatever the cause of defeat, the outlook for the Republicans
again brightened when Stephen A. Douglas opposed President Buchanan's
Lecompton policy. The Kansas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.246" id="Page_ii.246">ii. 246</a></span> Lecompton Constitution was the work of a
rump convention controlled by pro-slavery delegates who declared that
&quot;the right of property is before and higher than any constitutional
sanction, and the right of the owner of a slave to such slave and its
increase is as inviolable as the right of the owner of any property
whatever.&quot; To secure its approval by the people it was ingeniously
arranged that the vote taken in December, 1857, should be &quot;for the
constitution with slavery&quot; or &quot;for the constitution without slavery,&quot;
so that in any event the constitution, with its objectionable section,
would become the organic law. This shallow scheme, hatched in the
South to fix slavery upon a territory that had already declared for
freedom by several thousand majority, obtained the support of the
President. Douglas immediately pronounced it &quot;a trick&quot; and &quot;a fraud
upon the rights of the people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The breach between the Illinois
Senator and the Administration thus became complete.</p>

<p>Meantime, the governor of Kansas convened the territorial legislature
in an extra session, which provided for a second election in January,
1858. The December election had stood: for the constitution with
slavery, 6226; for the constitution without slavery, 569. Of these
2720 were subsequently shown to be fraudulent. The January election
stood: for the constitution with slavery, 138; for the constitution
without slavery, 24; against the constitution, 10,226. The President,
accepting the &quot;trick election,&quot; as Douglas called it, in which the
free-state men declined to participate, forwarded a copy of the
constitution to Congress, and, in spite of Douglas, it passed the
Senate. An amendment in the House returned it to the people with the
promise, if accepted, of a large grant of government land; but the
electors spurned the bribe&#8212;the free-state men, at a third election
held on August 2, 1858, rejecting the constitution by 11,000 out of
13,000 votes.</p>

<p>This ended the Lecompton episode, but it was destined to leave a
breach in the ranks of the Democrats big with con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.247" id="Page_ii.247">ii. 247</a></span>sequences. Stephen
A. Douglas was now the best known and most popular man in the North,
and his popular sovereignty doctrine, as applied to the Lecompton
Constitution, seemed so certain of settling the slavery question in
the interest of freedom that leading Republicans of New York, notably
Henry J. Raymond and Horace Greeley, not only favoured the return of
Douglas to the Senate unopposed by their own party, but seriously
considered the union of Douglas Democrats and Republicans. It was even
suggested that Douglas become the Republican candidate for President.
This would head off Seward and please Greeley, whose predilection for
an &quot;available&quot; candidate was only equalled by his growing distrust of
the New York Senator. The unanimous nomination of Abraham Lincoln for
United States senator and his great debate with Douglas, disclosing
the incompatibility between Douglasism and Republicanism, abruptly
ended this plan; but the plausible assumption that the inhabitants of
a territory had a natural right to establish, as well as prohibit,
slavery had made such a profound impression upon Northern Democrats
that they did not hesitate to approve the Douglas doctrine regardless
of its unpopularity in the South.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1858, candidates for governor were nominated in New
York. The Republican convention, convened at Syracuse on the 8th of
September, like its predecessor in 1856, was divided into Weed and
anti-Weed delegates. The latter, composed of Know-Nothings, Radicals
of Democratic antecedents, and remnants of the prohibition party,
wanted Timothy Jenkins for governor. Jenkins was a very skilful
political organiser. He had served Oneida County as district attorney
and for six years in Congress, and he now had the united support of
many men who, although without special influence, made a very
formidable showing. But Weed was not looking in that direction. His
earliest choice was Simeon Draper of New York City, whom he had thrust
aside two years before, and when sudden financial embarrassment
rendered Draper unavailable, he encouraged the candidacy of James H.
Cook of Saratoga until Jenkins'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.248" id="Page_ii.248">ii. 248</a></span> strength alarmed him. Then he took up
Edwin D. Morgan, and for the first time became a delegate to a state
convention.</p>

<p>Weed found a noisy company at Syracuse. Horace Greeley as usual was in
a receptive mood. The friends of George Patterson thought it time for
his promotion. Alexander S. Diven of Elmira, a state senator and
forceful speaker, who subsequently served one term in Congress, had
several active, influential backers, while John A. King's friends
feebly resisted his retirement. The bulk of the Americans opposed
Edwin D. Morgan because of his broad sympathies with foreign-born
citizens; but Weed clung to him, and on the first ballot he received
116 of the 254 votes. Jenkins got 51 and Greeley 3. On the next ballot
one of Greeley's votes went to Jenkins, who received 52 to 165 for
Morgan. Robert Campbell of Steuben was then nominated for
lieutenant-governor by acclamation and Seward's senatorial course
unqualifiedly indorsed.</p>

<p>Edwin D. Morgan was in his forty-eighth year. He had been alderman,
merchant, and railroad president; for four years in the early fifties
he served as a state senator; more recently, he had acted as chairman
of the Republican state committee and of the Republican national
convention. Weed did not have Morgan's wise, courageous course as war
governor, Union general, and United States senator to guide him, but
he knew that his personal character was of the highest, his public
life without stain, and that he had wielded the power of absolute
disinterestedness. Morgan was a fine specimen of manhood. He stood
perfectly erect, with well poised head, his large, lustrous eyes
inviting confidence; and the urbanity of his manner softening the
answers that showed he possessed a mind of his own. No man among his
contemporaries had a larger number of devoted friends. He was a New
Englander by birth. More than one person of his name and blood in
Connecticut was noted for public spirit, but none developed greater
courage, or evidenced equal sagacity and efficiency.</p>

<p>For several weeks before the convention, the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.249" id="Page_ii.249">ii. 249</a></span> talked of a
fusion ticket with the Republicans, and to encourage the plan both
state conventions met at the same time and place. In sentiment they
were in substantial accord, and men like Washington Hunt, the former
governor, and James O. Putnam, hoped for union. Hunt had declined to
join the Republican party at its formation, and, in 1856, had followed
Fillmore into the ranks of the Americans; but their division in 1857
disgusted him, and, with Putnam and many others, he was now favourable
to a fusion of the two parties. After conferring for two days,
however, the Republicans made the mistake of nominating candidates for
governor and lieutenant-governor before agreeing upon a division of
the offices, at which the Americans took offence and put up a separate
ticket, with Lorenzo Burrows for governor. Burrows was a man of
considerable force of character, a native of Connecticut, and a
resident of Albion. He had served four years in Congress as a Whig,
and in 1855 was elected state comptroller as a Know-Nothing.</p>

<p>The failure of the fusionists greatly pleased the Democrats, who, in
spite of the bitter contest for seats in the New York City delegation,
exhibited confidence and some enthusiasm at their state convention on
September 15. The Softs, led by Daniel E. Sickles, represented
Tammany; the Hards, marshalled by Fernando Wood, were known as the
custom-house delegation. In 1857, the city delegates had been evenly
divided between the two factions; but this year the Softs, confident
of their strength, insisted upon having their entire delegation
seated, and, on a motion to make Horatio Seymour temporary chairman,
they proved their control by a vote of 54 to 35. The admission of
Tammany drew a violent protest from Fernando Wood and his delegates,
who then left the convention in a body amidst a storm of hisses and
cheers.</p>

<p>A strong disposition existed to nominate Seymour for governor. Having
been thrice a candidate and once elected, however, he peremptorily
declined to stand. This left the way open to Amasa J. Parker, an
exceptionally strong candidate, but one who had led the ticket to
defeat in 1856. John J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.250" id="Page_ii.250">ii. 250</a></span> Taylor of Oswego, whose congressional career
had been limited to a single term because of his vote for the
Kansas-Nebraska bill in 1854, became the nominee for
lieutenant-governor by acclamation. In its platform, the convention
very cunningly resolved that it was &quot;content&quot; to have the American
people judge President Buchanan's administration by its acts, and that
it &quot;hailed with satisfaction&quot; the fact that the people of Kansas had
settled the Lecompton question by practically making the territory a
free State.</p>

<p>Thus Parker stood for Buchanan and popular sovereignty, while the
Republicans denounced the Lecompton trick as a wicked scheme to
subvert popular sovereignty. It was a sharp issue. The whole power of
the Administration had been invoked to carry out the Lecompton plan,
and New York congressmen were compelled to support it or be cast
aside. But in their speeches, Parker and his supporters sought to
minimise the President's part and to magnify the Douglas doctrine. It
was an easy and plausible way of settling the slavery question, and
one which commended itself to those who wished it settled by the
Democratic party. John Van Buren's use of it recalled something of the
influence and power that attended his speeches in the Free-soil
campaign of 1848. Since that day he had been on too many sides,
perhaps, to command the hearty respect of any, but he loved fair play,
which the Lecompton scheme had outraged, and the application of the
doctrine that seemed to have brought peace and a free State to the
people appealed to him as a correct principle of government that must
make for good. He presented it in the clear, impassioned style for
which he was so justly noted. His speeches contained much that did not
belong in the remarks of a statesman; but, upon the question of
popular sovereignty, as illustrated in Kansas, John Van Buren prepared
the way in New York for the candidacy and coming of Douglas in 1860.</p>

<p>Roscoe Conkling, now for the first time a candidate for Congress,
exhibited something of the dexterity and ability that characterised
his subsequent career. The public, friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.251" id="Page_ii.251">ii. 251</a></span> and foes, did not yet
judge him by a few striking and picturesque qualities, for his vanity,
imperiousness, and power to hate had not yet matured, but already he
was a close student of political history, and of great capacity as an
orator. The intense earnestness of purpose, the marvellous power of
rapidly absorbing knowledge, the quickness of wit, and the firmness
which Cato never surpassed, marked him then, as afterward upon the
floor of Congress, a mighty power amidst great antagonists. Perhaps
his anger was not so quickly excited, nor the shafts of his sarcasm so
barbed and cruel, but his speeches&#8212;dramatic, rhetorical, with the
ever-present, withering sneer&#8212;were rapidly advancing him to
leadership in central New York. A quick glance at his tall, graceful
form, capacious chest, and massive head, removed him from the class of
ordinary persons. Towering above his fellows, he looked the patrician.
It was known, too, that he had muscle as well as brains. Indeed, his
nomination to Congress had been influenced somewhat by the recent
assault on Charles Sumner. &quot;Preston Brooks won't hurt him,&quot; said the
leader of the Fifth Ward, in Utica.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The keynote of the campaign, however, was not spoken until Seward made
his historic speech at Rochester on October 25. The October success in
Pennsylvania had thrilled the Republicans; and the New York election
promised a victory like that of 1856. Whatever advantage could be
gained by past events and future expectations was now Seward's.
Lincoln's famous declaration, &quot;I believe this government cannot endure
permanently half slave and half free,&quot; had been uttered in June, and
his joint debate with Douglas, concluded on October 15, had cleared
the political atmosphere, making it plain that popular sovereignty was
not the pathway for Republicans to follow. Seward's utterance,
therefore, was to be the last word in the campaign.</p>

<p>It was not entirely clear just what this utterance would be. Seward
had shown much independence of late. In the preceding February his
course on the army bill caused se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.252" id="Page_ii.252">ii. 252</a></span>vere comment. Because of
difficulties with the Mormons in Utah it was proposed to increase the
army; but Republicans objected, believing the additional force would
be improperly used in Kansas. Seward, however, spoke and voted for the
bill. &quot;He is perfectly bedevilled,&quot; wrote Senator Fessenden; &quot;he
thinks himself wiser than all of us.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Later, in March, he caught
something of the popular-sovereignty idea&#8212;enough, at least, to draw a
mild protest from Salmon P. Chase. &quot;I regretted,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the
apparent countenance you gave to the idea that the Douglas doctrine of
popular sovereignty will do for us to stand upon for the
present.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Seward did not go so far as Greeley and Raymond, but
his expressions indicated that States were to be admitted with or
without slavery as the people themselves decided. Before, he had
insisted that Congress had the right to make conditions; now, his
willingness cheerfully to co-operate with Douglas and other &quot;new
defenders of the sacred cause in Kansas&quot; seemed to favour a new
combination, if not a new party. In other words, Seward had been
feeling his way until it aroused a faint suspicion that he was
trimming to catch the moderate element of his party. If he had had any
thought of harmony of feeling between Douglas and the Republicans,
however, the Lincoln debate compelled him to abandon it, and in his
speech of October 25 he confined himself to the discussion of the two
radically different political systems that divided the North and the
South.</p>

<p>The increase in population and in better facilities for internal
communication, he declared, had rapidly brought these two systems into
close contact, and collision was the result. &quot;Shall I tell you what
this collision means? They who think it is accidental, unnecessary,
the work of interested or fanatical agitators, and therefore
ephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an irrepressible
conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the
United States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a
slave-hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.253" id="Page_ii.253">ii. 253</a></span>ing nation, or entirely a free labour nation. Either the
cotton and rice fields of South Carolina and the sugar plantations of
Louisiana will ultimately be tilled by free labour, and Charleston and
New Orleans become marts for legitimate merchandise alone, or else the
rye fields and wheat fields of Massachusetts and New York must again
be surrendered by their farmers to slave culture and to the production
of slaves, and Boston and New York become once more markets for trade
in the bodies and souls of men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>It was one of the most impressive and commanding speeches that had
ever come from his eloquent lips, but there was nothing new in it. As
early as 1848 he had made the antagonism between freedom and slavery
the leading feature of a speech that attracted much attention at the
time, and in 1856 he spoke of &quot;an ancient and eternal conflict between
two entirely antagonistic systems of human labour.&quot; Indeed, for ten
years, in company with other distinguished speakers, he had been
ringing the changes on this same idea. Only four months before,
Lincoln had proclaimed that &quot;A house divided against itself cannot
stand.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Yet no one had given special attention to it. But now the
two words, &quot;irrepressible conflict,&quot; seemed to sum up the antipathy
between the two systems, and to alarm men into a realisation of the
real and perhaps the immediate danger that confronted them.
&quot;Hitherto,&quot; says Frederick W. Seward in the biography of his father,
&quot;while it was accepted and believed by those who followed his
political teachings, among his opponents it had fallen upon unheeding
ears and incredulous minds. But now, at last, the country was
beginning to wake up to the gravity of the crisis, and when he pointed
to the 'irrepressible conflict' he was formulating, in clear words, a
vague and unwilling belief that was creeping over every intelligent
Northern man.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. Democratic press and ora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.254" id="Page_ii.254">ii. 254</a></span>tors became
hysterical, denouncing him as &quot;vile,&quot; &quot;wicked,&quot; &quot;malicious,&quot; and
&quot;vicious.&quot; The <i>Herald</i> called him an &quot;arch-agitator,&quot; more dangerous
than Beecher, Garrison, or Theodore Parker. It was denied that any
conflict existed except such as he was trying to foment. Even the New
York <i>Times</i>, his own organ, thought the idea of abolishing slavery in
the slave States rather fanciful, while the Springfield <i>Republican</i>
pronounced his declaration impolitic and likely to do him and his
party harm. On the other hand, the radical anti-slavery papers thought
it bold and commendable. &quot;With the instinct of a statesman,&quot; the
<i>Tribune</i> said, &quot;Seward discards all minor, temporary, and delusive
issues, and treats only of what is final and essential. Clear, calm,
sagacious, profound, and impregnable, showing a masterly comprehension
of the present aspect and future prospects of the great question which
now engrosses our politics, this speech will be pondered by every
thoughtful man in the land and confirm the eminence so long maintained
by its author.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> James Watson Webb, in the <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>,
declared that it made Seward and Republicanism one and inseparable,
and settled the question in New York as to who should be the
standard-bearer in 1860.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.255" id="Page_ii.255">ii. 255</a></span></p>
<p>The result of the election was favourable to the Republicans, Morgan's
majority over Parker being 17,440.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Ninety-nine members of the
Legislature and twenty-nine congressmen were either Republicans or
anti-Lecompton men. But, compared with the victory of 1856, it was a
disappointment. John A. King had received a majority of 65,000 over
Parker. The <i>Tribune</i> was quick to charge some of this loss to Seward.
&quot;The clamour against Sewardism lost us many votes,&quot; it declared the
morning after the election. Two or three days later, as the reduced
majority became more apparent, it explained that &quot;A knavish clamour
was raised on the eve of election by a Swiss press against Governor
Seward's late speech at Rochester as revolutionary and disunionist.
Our loss from this source is considerable.&quot; The returns, however,
showed plainly that one-half of the Americans, following the precedent
set in 1857, had voted for Parker, while the other half, irritated by
the failure of the union movement at Syracuse, had supported Burrows.
Had the coalition succeeded, Morgan's majority must have been larger
than King's. But, small as it was, there was abundant cause for
Republican rejoicing, since it kept the Empire State in line with the
Republican States of New England, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin,
which were now joined for the first time by Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
and Minnesota. Indeed, of the free States, only California and Oregon
had indorsed Buchanan's administration.</p>

SEWARD&#8217;S BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY<br />
<br />
1859-1860</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> elections in 1858 simplified the political situation. With the
exception of Pennsylvania, where the tariff question played a
conspicuous part, all the Northern States had disapproved President
Buchanan's Lecompton policy, and the people, save the old-line Whigs,
the Abolitionists, and the Americans, had placed themselves under the
leadership of Seward, Lincoln, and Douglas, who now clearly
represented the political sentiments of the North. If any hope still
lingered among the Democrats of New York, that the sectional division
of their party might be healed, it must have been quickly shattered by
the fierce debates over popular sovereignty and the African
slave-trade which occurred in the United States Senate in February,
1859, between Jefferson Davis, representing the slave power of the
South, and Stephen A. Douglas, the recognised champion of his party in
the free States.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the Democratic national convention, called
to meet in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 23, 1860, became the
centre of interest in the state convention, which met at Syracuse on
the 14th of September, 1859. Each faction desired to control the
national delegation. As usual, Daniel S. Dickinson was a candidate for
the Presidency. He believed his friends in the South would prefer him
to Douglas if he could command an unbroken New York delegation, and,
with the hope of having the delegates selected by districts as the
surer road to success, he flirted with Fernando Wood until the
latter's perfidy turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.257" id="Page_ii.257">ii. 257</a></span> his ear to the siren song of the Softs, who
promised him a solid delegation whenever it could secure his
nomination. Dickinson listened with distrust. He was the last of the
old leaders of the Hards. Seymour and Marcy had left them; but
&quot;Scripture Dick,&quot; as he was called, because of his many Bible
quotations, stood resolutely and arrogantly at his post, defying the
machinations of his opponents with merciless criticism. The Binghamton
Stalwart did not belong in the first rank of statesmen. He was neither
an orator nor a tactful party leader. It cannot be said of him that he
was a quickwitted, incisive, and successful debater;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> but, on
critical days, when the fate of his faction hung in the balance, he
was a valiant fighter, absolutely without fear, who took blows as
bravely as he gave them, and was loyal to all the interests which he
espoused. He now dreaded the Softs bearing gifts. But their evident
frankness and his supreme need melted the estrangement that had long
existed between them.</p>

<p>In the selection of delegates to the state convention Fernando Wood
and Tammany had a severe struggle. Tammany won, but Wood appeared at
Syracuse with a full delegation, and for half an hour before the
convention convened Wood endeavoured to do by force what he knew could
not be accomplished by votes. He had brought with him a company of
roughs, headed by John C. Heenan, &quot;the Benicia Boy,&quot; and fifteen
minutes before the appointed hour, in the absence of a majority of the
delegates, he organised the convention, electing his own chairman and
appointing his own committees. When the bulk of the Softs arrived they
proceeded to elect their chairman. This was the signal for a riot, in
the course of which the chairman of the regulars was knocked down and
an intimidating display of pistols exhibited. Finally the regulars
adjourned, leaving the hall to the Wood contestants, who completed
their organisation, and, after re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.258" id="Page_ii.258">ii. 258</a></span>nominating the Democratic state
officers elected in 1857, adjourned without day.</p>

<p>Immediately, the regulars reappeared; and as the Hards from the
up-state counties answered to the roll call, the Softs vociferously
applauded. Then Dickinson made a characteristic speech. He did not
fully decide to join the Softs until Fernando Wood had sacrificed the
only chance of overthrowing them; but when he did go over, he burned
the bridges behind him. The Softs were delighted with Dickinson's
bearing and Dickinson's speech. It united the party throughout the
State and put Tammany in easy control of New York City.</p>

<p>With harmony restored there was little for the convention to do except
to renominate the state officers, appoint delegates to the Charleston
convention who were instructed to vote as a unit, and adopt the
platform. These resolutions indorsed the administration of President
Buchanan; approved popular sovereignty; condemned the &quot;irrepressible
conflict&quot; speech of Seward as a &quot;revolutionary threat&quot; aimed at
republican institutions; and opposed the enlargement of the Erie canal
to a depth of seven feet.</p>

<p>The Republican state convention had previously assembled on September
7 and selected a ticket, equally divided between men of Democratic and
Whig antecedents, headed by Elias W. Leavenworth for secretary of
state. Great confidence was felt in its election until the Americans
met in convention on September 22 and indorsed five of its candidates
and four Democrats. This, however, did not abate Republican activity,
and, in the end, six of the nine Republican nominees were elected. The
weight of the combined opposition, directed against Leavenworth,
caused his defeat by less than fifteen hundred, showing that
Republicans were gradually absorbing all the anti-slavery elements.</p>

<p>Upon what theory the American party nominated an eclectic ticket did
not appear, although the belief obtained that it hoped to cloud
Seward's presidential prospects by creating the impression that the
Senator was unable, without assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.259" id="Page_ii.259">ii. 259</a></span>ance, to carry his own State on the
eve of a great national contest. But whatever the reason, the result
deeply humiliated the party, since its voting strength, reduced to
less than 21,000, proved insufficient to do more than expose the
weakness. This was the last appearance of the American party. It had
endeavoured to extend its life and increase its influence; but after
its refusal to interdict slavery in the territories it rapidly melted
away. Henry Wilson, senator and Vice President, declared that he would
give ten years of his life if he could blot out his membership in the
Know-Nothing party, since it associated him throughout his long and
attractive public career with proscriptive principles of which he was
ashamed.</p>

<p>In the midst of the campaign the country was startled by John Brown's
raid at Harper's Ferry. For two years Brown had lived an uneventful
life in New York on land in the Adirondack region given him by Gerrit
Smith. In 1851, he moved to Ohio, and from thence to Kansas, where he
became known as John Brown of Osawatomie. He had been a consistent
enemy of slavery, working the underground railroad and sympathising
with every scheme for the rescue of slaves; but once in Kansas, he
readily learned the use of a Sharpe's rifle. In revenge for the
destruction of Lawrence, he deliberately massacred the pro-slavery
settlers living along Pottawatomie creek. &quot;Without the shedding of
blood there is no remission of sins,&quot; was a favourite text. His
activity made him a national character. The President offered $250 for
his arrest and the governor of Missouri added $3000 more. In 1858, he
returned East, collected money to aid an insurrection among the slaves
of Virginia, and on October 17, 1859, with eighteen men, began his
quixotic campaign by cutting telegraph wires, stopping trains, and
seizing the national armory at Harper's Ferry. At one time he had
taken sixty prisoners.</p>

<p>The affair was soon over, but not until the entire band was killed or
captured. Brown, severely hurt, stood between two of his sons, one
dead and the other mortally wounded, refus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.260" id="Page_ii.260">ii. 260</a></span>ing to surrender so long as
he could fight. After his capture, he said, coolly, in reply to a
question: &quot;We are Abolitionists from the North, come to release and
take your slaves.&quot;</p>

<p>The trial, conviction, and execution of Brown and his captured
companions ended the episode, but its influence was destined to be
far-reaching. John Brown became idealised. His bearing as he stood
between his dead and dying sons, his truth-telling answers, and the
evidence of his absolute unselfishness filled many people in the North
with a profound respect for the passion that had driven him on, while
his bold invasion of a slave State and his reckless disregard of life
and property alarmed the South into the sincere belief that his
methods differed only in degree from the teachings of those who talked
of an irrepressible conflict and a higher law. To aid him in regaining
his lost position in the South, Stephen A. Douglas proclaimed it as
his &quot;firm and deliberate belief that the Harper Ferry crime was the
natural, logical, and inevitable result of the doctrine and teachings
of the Republican party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>The sentimentalists of the North generally sympathised with Brown.
Emerson spoke of him as &quot;that new saint awaiting his martyrdom, and
who, if he shall suffer, will make the gallows glorious like the
cross.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> In the same spirit Thoreau called him &quot;an angel of
light,&quot; and Longfellow wrote in his diary on the day of the execution:
&quot;The date of a new revolution, quite as much needed as the old
one.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> But the Republican leaders deprecated the affair,
characterising it as &quot;among the gravest of crimes,&quot; and denying that
it had any relation to their party except as it influenced the minds
of all men for or against slavery.</p>

<p>William H. Seward was in Europe at the time of the raid. Early in May,
1859, his friends had celebrated his departure from New York,
escorting him to Sandy Hook, and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.261" id="Page_ii.261">ii. 261</a></span> him finally amidst shouts
and music, bells and whistles, and the waving of hats and
handkerchiefs. Such a scene is common enough nowadays, but then it was
unique. His return at the close of December, after an absence of eight
months, was the occasion of great rejoicing. A salute of a hundred
guns was fired in City Hall Park, the mayor and common council
tendered him a public reception, and after hours of speech-making and
hand-shaking he proceeded slowly homeward amidst waiting crowds at
every station. At Auburn the streets were decorated, and the people,
regardless of creed or party, escorted him in procession to his home.
Few Republicans in New York had any doubt at that moment of his
nomination and election to the Presidency.</p>

<p>On going to Washington Seward found the United States Senate
investigating the Harper's Ferry affair and the House of
Representatives deadlocked over the election of a speaker. Bitterness
and threats of disunion characterised the proceeding at both ends of
the Capitol. &quot;This Union,&quot; said one congressman, &quot;great and powerful
as it is, can be tumbled down by the act of any one Southern State. If
Florida withdraws, the federal government would not dare attack her.
If it did, the bands would dissolve as if melted by lightning.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
Referring to the possibility of the election of a Republican
President, another declared that &quot;We will never submit to the
inauguration of a Black Republican President. You may elect Seward to
be President of the North; but of the South, never! Whenever a
President is elected by a fanatical majority of the North, those whom
I represent are ready, let the consequences be what they may, to fall
back on their reserved rights, and say, 'As to this Union we have no
longer any lot or part in it.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of these fiery, disunion utterances, on the 21st of
February, 1860, Seward introduced a bill for the admission of Kansas
into the Union. After the overwhelming defeat of the Lecompton
Constitution, the free-state men had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.262" id="Page_ii.262">ii. 262</a></span> controlled the territorial
legislature, repealed the slave code of 1855, and, in the summer of
1859, convened a constitutional convention at Wyandotte. A few weeks
later the people ratified the result of its work by a large majority.
It was this Wyandotte Constitution under which Seward proposed to
admit Kansas, and he fixed the consideration of his measure for the
29th of February. This would be two days after Abraham Lincoln had
spoken in New York City.</p>

<p>Lincoln, whose fame had made rapid strides in the West since his
debate with Douglas in 1858, had been anxious to visit New York. It
was the home of Seward, the centre of Republican strength, and to him
practically an unknown land. Through the invitation of the Young Men's
Central Republican Union he was now to lecture at Cooper Institute on
the 27th of February. It was arranged at first that he speak in Henry
Ward Beecher's church, but the change, relieving him from too close
association with the great apostle of abolition, opened a wider door
for his reception. Personally he was known to very few people in the
city or State. In 1848, on his way to New England to take the stump,
he had called upon Thurlow Weed at Albany, and together they visited
Millard Fillmore, then candidate for Vice President; but the meeting
made such a slight impression upon the editor of the <i>Evening Journal</i>
that he had entirely forgotten it. Thirty years before, in one of his
journeys to Illinois, William Cullen Bryant had met him. Lincoln was
then a tall, awkward lad, the captain of a militia company in the
Black Hawk War, whose racy and original conversation attracted the
young poet; but Bryant, too, had forgotten him, and it was long after
the famous debate that he identified his prairie acquaintance as the
opponent of Douglas. Lincoln, however, did not come as a stranger. His
encounter with the great Illinoisan had marked him as a powerful and
logical reasoner whose speeches embraced every political issue of the
day and cleared up every doubtful point. Well-informed people
everywhere knew of him. He was not yet a national character, but he
had a national reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.263" id="Page_ii.263">ii. 263</a></span></p>

<p>Though Lincoln's lecture was one of a course, the admission fee did
not restrain an eager audience from filling the commodious hall.
&quot;Since the day of Clay and Webster,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;no man has
spoken to a larger assemblage of the intellect and mental culture of
our city.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Bryant acted as chairman of the meeting, and other
well-known men of the city occupied the stage. In his <i>Life of
Lincoln</i>, Herndon suggests that the new suit of clothes which seemed
so fine in his Springfield home was in such awkward contrast with the
neatly fitting dress of the New Yorkers that it disconcerted him, and
the brilliant audience dazzled and embarrassed him; but his hearers
thought only of the pregnant matter of the discourse, so calmly and
logically discussed that Horace Greeley, years afterward, pronounced
it &quot;the very best political address to which I ever listened, and I
have heard some of Webster's grandest.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln had carefully prepared for the occasion. He came East to show
what manner of man he was, and while he evidenced deep moral feeling
which kept his audience in a glow, he combined with it rare political
sagacity, notably in omitting the &quot;house divided against itself&quot;
declaration. He argued that the Republican party was not
revolutionary, but conservative, since it maintained the doctrine of
the fathers who held and acted upon the opinion that Congress had the
power to prohibit slavery in the territories. &quot;Some of you,&quot; he said,
addressing himself to the Southern people, &quot;are for reviving the
foreign slave trade; some for Congress forbidding the territories to
prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining slavery in
the territories through the judiciary; some for the 'great principle'
that if one man would enslave another, no third man should object,
fantastically called popular sovereignty; but never a man among you is
in favour of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories,
according to the practice of our fathers who formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.264" id="Page_ii.264">ii. 264</a></span> the government
under which we live. You say we have made the slavery question more
prominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more
prominent, but we deny that we made it so. It was not we, but you who
discarded the old policy of the fathers.&quot; Of Southern threats of
disunion, he said: &quot;Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you
will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and
enforce the Constitution as you please on all points in dispute
between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events.&quot; Referring to
the Harper's Ferry episode, he said: &quot;That affair in its philosophy
corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the
assassination of kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods over the
oppression of a people, until he fancies himself commissioned by
heaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt which ends in little
else than his own execution.&quot;</p>

<p>Lincoln's lecture did not disappoint. He had entertained and
interested the vast assemblage, which frequently rang with cheers and
shouts of applause as the gestures and the mirth-provoking look
emphasised the racy hits that punctuated the address. &quot;No man,&quot; said
the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;ever before made such an impression on his first
appeal to a New York audience. He is one of Nature's orators.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Two days later, Seward addressed the United States Senate. There is no
evidence that he fixed this date because of the Cooper Institute
lecture. The gravity of the political situation demanded some
expression from him; but the knowledge of the time of Lincoln's speech
gave him ample opportunity to arrange to follow it with one of his
own, if he wished to have the last word, or to institute a comparison
of their respective views on the eve of the national convention.
However this may be, Seward regarded his utterances on this occasion
of the utmost importance. He was the special object of Southern
vituperation. A &quot;Fire-Eater&quot; of the South publicly advertised that he
would be one of one hundred &quot;gentlemen&quot; to give twenty-five dollars
each for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.265" id="Page_ii.265">ii. 265</a></span> heads of Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, and forty
other prominent Northern leaders in and out of Congress, but for the
head of Seward his proposed subscription was multiplied twenty fold.
It is noticeable that in this long list of &quot;traitors&quot; the name of
Abraham Lincoln does not appear. It was Seward whom the South expected
the Republican party would nominate for President, and in him it saw
the narrow-minded, selfish, obstinate Abolitionist who hated them as
intensely as they despised him. To dispossess the Southern mind of
this feeling the Auburn statesman now endeavoured to show that if
elected President he would not treat the South unfriendly.</p>

<p>Seward's speech bears evidence of careful preparation. It was not only
read to friends for criticism, but Henry B. Stanton, in his <i>Random
Recollections</i>, says that Seward, before the day of its delivery,
assisted him in describing such a scene in the Senate as he desired
laid before the public. On his return to Washington, Seward had not
been received with a show of friendship by his associates from the
South. It was remarked that while Republican senators greeted him
warmly, &quot;his Southern friends were afraid to be seen talking to him.&quot;
On the occasion of his speech, however, he wished the record to show
every senator in his place and deeply interested.</p>

<p>Visitors to the Senate on the 29th of February crowded every available
spot in the galleries. &quot;But it was on the floor itself,&quot; wrote Stanton
to the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;that the most interesting spectacle presented
itself. Every senator seemed to be in his seat. Hunter, Davis, Toombs,
Mason, Slidell, Hammond, Clingman, Brown, and Benjamin paid closest
attention to the speaker. Crittenden listened to every word. Douglas
affected to be self-possessed; but his nervousness of mien gave token
that the truths now uttered awakened memories of the Lecompton
contest, when he, Seward, and Crittenden, the famous triumvirate, led
the allies in their attack upon the Administration. The members of the
House streamed over to the north wing of the Capitol almost in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.266" id="Page_ii.266">ii. 266</a></span>
body, leaving Reagan of Texas to discourse to empty benches, while
Seward held his levee in the Senate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Seward lacked the tones, the kindly eye, and the mirth-provoking look
of Lincoln. His voice was husky, his manner didactic, and his physique
unimposing, but he had the gift of expression, and the ability to
formulate his opinions and marshal his facts in lucid sentences that
harmonised with Northern sentiments and became at once the creed and
rallying cry of his party; and, on this occasion, he held the Senate
spellbound for two hours, the applause at one time becoming so long
continued that the presiding officer threatened to clear the
galleries. He was always calm and temperate. But it seemed now to be
his desire, in language more subdued, perhaps, than he had ever used
before, to allay the fears of what would happen should the Republican
party succeed in electing a President; and, without the sacrifice of
any principle, he endeavoured to outline the views of Republicans and
the spirit that animated himself. There was nothing new in his speech.
He avoided the higher law and irrepressible conflict doctrines, and
omitted his former declarations that slavery &quot;can and must be
abolished, and you and I can and must do it.&quot; In like manner he failed
to demand, as formerly, that the Supreme Court &quot;recede from its
spurious judgment&quot; in the Dred Scott case. But he reviewed with the
same logic that had characterised his utterances for twenty years, the
relation of the Constitution to slavery; the influence of slavery upon
both parties; the history of the Kansas controversy; and the manifest
advantages of the Union, dwelling at length and with much originality
upon the firm hold it had upon the people, and the certainty that it
would survive the rudest shocks of faction. Of the Harper's Ferry
affair, Seward spoke with more sympathy than Lincoln. &quot;While generous
and charitable natures will probably concede that John Brown acted on
earnest, though fatally erroneous convictions,&quot; he said, &quot;yet all good
citizens will nevertheless agree that this attempt to execute an
un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.267" id="Page_ii.267">ii. 267</a></span>lawful purpose in Virginia by invasion, involving servile war, was
an act of sedition and treason, and criminal in just the extent that
it affected the public peace and was destructive of human happiness
and life.&quot;</p>

<p>It has been noted with increasing admiration that Lincoln and Seward,
without consultation and in the presence of a great impending crisis,
paralleled one another's views so closely. Each embodied the
convictions and aspirations of his party. The spirit of an unsectarian
patriotism that characterised Seward's speech proved highly
satisfactory to the great mass of Republicans. The New York <i>Times</i>
rejoiced that its tone indicated &quot;a desire to allay and remove
unfounded prejudice from the public mind,&quot; and pronounced &quot;the whole
tenor of it in direct contradiction to the sentiments which have been
imputed to him on the strength of declarations which he has hitherto
made.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Samuel Bowles of the Springfield <i>Republican</i> wrote
Thurlow Weed that the state delegation&#8212;so &quot;very marked&quot; is the
reaction in Seward's favour&#8212;would &quot;be so strong for him as to be
against anybody else,&quot; and that &quot;I hear of ultra old Whigs in Boston
who say they are ready to take him up on his recent speech.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Charles A. Dana, then managing editor of the <i>Tribune</i>, declared that
&quot;Seward stock is rising,&quot; and Salmon P. Chase admitted that &quot;there
seems to be at present a considerable set toward Seward.&quot; Nathaniel P.
Banks, who was himself spoken of as a candidate, thought Seward's
prospects greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>But a growing and influential body of men in the Republican party
severely criticised the speech because it lacked the moral earnestness
of the &quot;higher law&quot; spirit. To them it seemed as if Seward had made a
bid for the Presidency, and that the irrepressible conflict of 1858
was suddenly transformed into the condition of a mild and patient
lover who is determined not to quarrel. &quot;Differences of opinion, even
on the subject of slavery,&quot; he said, &quot;are with us political, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.268" id="Page_ii.268">ii. 268</a></span>
social or personal differences. There is not one disunionist or
disloyalist among us all. We are altogether unconscious of any process
of dissolution going on among us or around us. We have never been more
patient, and never loved the representatives of other sections more
than now. We bear the same testimony for the people around us here. We
bear the same testimony for all the districts and States we
represent.&quot;</p>

<p>This did not sound like the terrible &quot;irrepressible conflict&quot; pictured
at Rochester. Wendell Phillips' famous epigram that &quot;Seward makes a
speech in Washington on the tactics of the Republican party, but
phrases it to suit Wall street,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> voiced the sentiment of his
critics. Garrison was not less severe. &quot;The temptation which proved
too powerful for Webster,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is seducing Seward to take the
same downward course.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Greeley did not vigorously combat this
idea. &quot;Governor Seward,&quot; he said, &quot;has so long been stigmatised as a
radical that those who now first study his inculcations carefully will
be astonished to find him so eminently pacific and conservative.
Future generations will be puzzled to comprehend how such sentiments
as his, couched in the language of courtesy and suavity which no
provocation can induce him to discard, should ever have been denounced
as incendiary.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>No doubt much of this criticism was due to personal jealousy, or to
the old prejudice against him as a Whig leader who had kept himself in
accord with the changing tendencies of a progressive people,
alternately exciting them with irrepressible conflicts and soothing
them with sentences of conservative wisdom; but Bowles, in approving
the speech because it had brought ultra old Whigs of Boston to
Seward's support, exposed the real reason for the adverse criticism,
since an address that would capture an old-line Whig, who indorsed
Fillmore in 1856, could scarcely satisfy the type of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.269" id="Page_ii.269">ii. 269</a></span> Republicans who
believed, with John A. Andrew, that whether the Harper's Ferry
enterprise was wise or foolish, &quot;John Brown himself is right.&quot; It is
little wonder, perhaps, that these people began to doubt whether
Seward had strong convictions.</p>

<br />
DEAN RICHMOND&#8217;S LEADERSHIP AT CHARLESTON<br />
<br />
1860</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">When</span> the Democratic national convention opened at Charleston, South
Carolina, on April 23, 1860, Fernando Wood insisted upon the admission
of his delegation on equal terms with Tammany. The supreme question
was the nomination of Stephen A. Douglas, and the closeness of the
contest between the Douglas and anti-Douglas forces made New York's
thirty-five votes most important. Wood promised his support, if
admitted, to the anti-Douglas faction; the Softs, led by Dean
Richmond, encouraged Douglas and whispered kindly words to the
supporters of James Guthrie of Kentucky. It was apparent that Wood's
delegation had no standing. It had been appointed before the legal
hour for the convention's assembling in the absence of a majority of
the delegates, and upon no theory could its regularity be accepted;
but Wood, mild and bland in manner, made a favourable impression in
Charleston. No one would have pointed him out in a group of gentlemen
as the redoubtable mayor of New York City, who invented surprises,
and, with a retinue of roughs, precipitated trouble in conventions.
His adroit speeches, too, had won him advantage, and when he pledged
himself to the ultra men of the South his admission became a necessary
factor to their success. This, naturally, threw the Softs into the
camp of Douglas, whose support made their admission possible.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.271" id="Page_ii.271">ii. 271</a></span></p>
<p>The New York delegation, composed of distinguished business men and
adroit politicians, was divided into two factions, each one fancying
itself the more truly patriotic, public-spirited, and
independent.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The Softs had trapped the Hards into allegiance with
the promise of a solid support for Dickinson whenever the convention
manifested a disposition to rally around him&#8212;and then gagged them by
a rigid unit rule. This made Dickinson declamatory and bitter, while
the Softs themselves, professing devotion to Douglas, exhibited an
unrest which indicated that changed conditions would easily change
their devotion. Altogether, it was a disappointing delegation,
distrusted by the Douglas men, feared by the South, and at odds with
itself; yet, it is doubtful if the Empire State ever sent an abler
body of men to a national convention. Its chairman, Dean Richmond, now
at the height of his power, was a man of large and comprehensive
vision, and, although sometimes charged with insincerity, his rise in
politics had not been more rapid than his success in business. Before
his majority he had become the director of a bank, and at the age of
thirty-eight he had established himself in Buffalo as a prosperous
dealer and shipper. Then, he aided in consolidating seven corporations
into the New York Central Railroad&#8212;securing the necessary legislation
for the purpose&#8212;and in 1853 had become its vice president. Eleven
years later, and two years before his death, he became its president.
In 1860, Dean Richmond was in his forty-seventh year, incapable of any
meanness, yet adroit, shrewd, and skilful, stating very perfectly the
judgment of a clear-headed and sound business man. As chairman of the
Democratic state committee, he was a somewhat rugged but an intensely
interesting personality, who had won deservedly by his work a foremost
place among the most influential na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.272" id="Page_ii.272">ii. 272</a></span>tional leaders of the party. His
opinion carried great weight, and, though he spoke seldom, his mind
moved rapidly by a very simple and direct path to correct
conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Around Richmond were clustered August Belmont and Augustus Schell of
New York City, Peter Cagger and Erastus Corning of Albany, David L.
Seymour of Troy, Sanford E. Church of Albion, and a dozen others quite
as well known. Perhaps none of them equalled the powerful Richardson
of Illinois, who led the Douglas forces, or his brilliant lieutenant,
Charles E. Stuart of Michigan, whose directions and suggestions on the
floor of the convention, guided by an unerring knowledge of
parliamentary law, were regarded with something of dread even by Caleb
Cushing, the gifted president of the convention; but John Cochrane of
New York City, who had attended Democratic state and national
conventions for a quarter of a century, was quite able to represent
the Empire State to its advantage on the floor or elsewhere. He was a
man of a high order of ability, and an accomplished and forceful
public speaker, whose sonorous voice, imposing manner, and skilful
tactics made him at home in a parliamentary fight. &quot;Cochrane is a
large but not a big man,&quot; said a correspondent of the day, &quot;full in
the region of the vest, and wears his beard, which is coarse and
sandy, trimmed short. His head is bald, and his countenance bold, and
there are assurances in his complexion that he is a generous liver. He
is a fair type of the fast man of intellect and culture, whose
ambition is to figure in politics. He is in Congress and can command
the ear of the House at any time. His great trouble is his Free-soil
record. He took Free-soilism like a distemper and mounted the Buffalo
platform. He is well over it now, however, with the exception of a
single heresy&#8212;the homestead law. He is for giving homesteads to the
actual settlers upon the public land.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.273" id="Page_ii.273">ii. 273</a></span></p>
<p>Douglas had a majority of the delegates in the Charleston convention.
But, with the aid of California and Oregon, the South had seventeen of
the thirty-three States. This gave it a majority of the committee on
resolutions, and, after five anxious days of protracted and earnest
debate, that committee reported a platform declaring it the duty of
the federal government to protect slavery in the territories, and
denying the power of a territory either to abolish slavery or to
destroy the rights of property in slaves by any legislation whatever.
The minority reaffirmed the Cincinnati platform of 1856, with the
following preamble and resolution: &quot;Inasmuch as differences of opinion
exist in the Democratic party as to the nature and extent of the
powers of a territorial legislature, and as to the powers and duties
of Congress over the institution of slavery within the territories;
Resolved, that the Democratic party will abide by the decisions of the
Supreme Court on the questions of constitutional law.&quot;</p>

<p>It was quickly evident that the disagreement which had plunged the
committee into trouble extended to the convention. The debate became
hot and bitter. In a speech of remarkable power, William L. Yancey of
Alabama upbraided the Northern delegates for truckling to the
Free-soil spirit. &quot;You acknowledged,&quot; he said, &quot;that slavery did not
exist by the law of nature or by the law of God&#8212;that it only existed
by state law; that it was wrong, but that you were not to blame. That
was your position, and it was wrong. If you had taken the position
directly that slavery was right ... you would have triumphed. But you
have gone down before the enemy so that they have put their foot upon
your neck; you will go lower and lower still, unless you change front
and change your tactics. When I was a schoolboy in the Northern
States, abolitionists were pelted with rotten eggs. But now this band
of abolitionists has spread and grown into three bands&#8212;the black
Republican, the Free-soilers, and squatter sovereignty men&#8212;all
representing the common sentiment that slavery is wrong.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Against
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.274" id="Page_ii.274">ii. 274</a></span> extreme Southern demand that Northern Democrats declare slavery
right and its extension legitimate, Senator Pugh of Ohio vigorously
protested. &quot;Gentlemen of the South,&quot; he thundered, &quot;you mistake
us&#8212;you mistake us! we will not do it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The admission of the Softs and the adoption of a rule allowing
individual delegates from uninstructed States to vote as they pleased
had given the Douglas men an assured majority, and on the seventh day,
when the substitution of the minority for the majority report by a
vote of 165 to 138 threatened to culminate in the South's withdrawal,
the Douglas leaders permitted a division of their report into its
substantive propositions. Under this arrangement, the Cincinnati
platform was reaffirmed by a vote of 237&#189; to 65. The danger point
had now been reached, and Edward Driggs of Brooklyn, scenting the
brewing mischief, moved to table the balance of the report. Driggs
favoured Douglas, but, in common with his delegation, he favoured a
united party more, and could his motion have been carried at that
moment with a show of unanimity, the subsequent secession might have
been checked if not wholly avoided. The Douglas leaders, however, not
yet sufficiently alarmed, thought the withdrawal of two or three
Southern States might aid rather than hinder the nomination of their
chief, and on this theory Driggs' motion was tabled. But, when
Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi withdrew their votes, and nearly
the entire South refused to express an opinion on the popular
sovereignty plank, the extent of the secession suddenly flashed upon
Richardson, who endeavoured to speak in the din of the wildest
excitement. Richardson had withdrawn Douglas' name at the Cincinnati
convention in 1856; and, thinking some way out of their present
trouble might now be suggested by him, John Cochrane, in a voice as
musical as it was far-reaching, urged the convention to hear one whom
he believed brought another &quot;peace offering;&quot; but objection was made,
and the roll call continued. Richardson's purpose, however, had not
escaped the vigilant New Yorkers, who now retired for consultation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.275" id="Page_ii.275">ii. 275</a></span>
The question was, should they strike out the only resolution having
the slightest significance in the minority report? By the time they
had decided in the affirmative, and returned to the hall, the whole
Douglas army was in full retreat, willing, finally, to stand solely
upon the reaffirmation of the Cincinnati platform, where the Driggs
motion would have landed them two hours earlier.</p>

<p>But the Douglas leaders were not yet satisfied. Writhing under their
forced surrender, Stuart of Michigan took the floor, and by an
inflammatory speech of the most offensive type started the stampede
which the surrender of the Douglas platform was intended to avoid.
Alabama led off, followed by Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina,
Florida, Texas, and Arkansas. Glenn of Mississippi, pale with emotion,
spoke the sentiments of the seceders. &quot;Our going,&quot; he said, &quot;is not
conceived in passion or carried out from mere caprice or
disappointment. It is the firm resolve of the great body we represent.
The people of Mississippi ask, what is the construction of the
platform of 1856? You of the North say it means one thing; we of the
South another. They ask which is right and which is wrong? The North
have maintained their position, but, while doing so, they have not
acknowledged the rights of the South. We say, go your way and we will
go ours. But the South leaves not like Hagar, driven into the
wilderness, friendless and alone, for in sixty days you will find a
united South standing shoulder to shoulder.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>This declaration, spoken with piercing emphasis, was received with the
most enthusiastic applause that had thus far marked the proceedings of
the convention. &quot;The South Carolinians cheered long and loud,&quot; says an
eye-witness, &quot;and the tempest of shouts made the circuit of the
galleries and the floor several times before it subsided. A large
number of ladies favoured the secessionists with their sweetest smiles
and with an occasional clapping of hands.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.276" id="Page_ii.276">ii. 276</a></span></p>
<p>All this was telling hard upon the New York delegation.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> It wanted
harmony more than Douglas. Dickinson aspired to bring Southern friends
to his support,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> while Dean Richmond was believed secretly to
indulge the hope that ultimately Horatio Seymour might be nominated;
and, under the plausible and patriotic guise of harmonising the party,
the delegation had laboured hard to secure a compromise. It was shown
that Douglas need not be nominated; that with the South present he
could not receive a two-thirds majority; that with another candidate
the Southern States would continue in control. It was known that a
majority of the delegation stood ready even to vote for a conciliatory
resolution, a mild slave code plank, declaring that all citizens of
the United States have an equal right to settle, with their property,
in the territories, and that under the Supreme Court's decisions
neither rights of person nor property could be destroyed or impaired
by congressional or territorial legislation. This was Richmond's last
card. In playing it he took desperate chances, but he was tired of the
strain of maintaining the leadership of one faction, and of avoiding a
total disruption with the other.</p>

<p>To the Southern extremists, marshalled by Mason and Slidell, the
platform was of secondary importance. They wanted to destroy Guthrie,
a personal enemy of Slidell, as well as to defeat Douglas, and,
although it was apparent that the latter could not secure a two-thirds
majority, it was no less evident that the Douglas vote could nominate
Guthrie. To break up this combination, therefore, the ultras saw no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.277" id="Page_ii.277">ii. 277</a></span>
way open except to break up the convention on the question of a
platform. This phase of the case left Richmond absolutely helpless.
The secession of the cotton States might weaken Douglas, but it could
in nowise aid the chances of a compromise candidate, since the latter,
if nominated, must rely upon a large portion of the Douglas vote.</p>

<p>But Dean Richmond did not lose sight of his ultimate purpose. The
secession left the convention with 253 out of 304 votes; and a motion
requiring a candidate to obtain two-thirds of the original number
became a test of devotion to Douglas, who hoped to get two-thirds of
the remaining votes, but who could not, under any circumstances,
receive two-thirds of the original number. As New York's vote was now
decisive, it put the responsibility directly upon Richmond. It was his
opportunity to help or to break Douglas. The claim that precedent
required two-thirds of the electoral vote to nominate was rejected by
Stuart as not having the sanction of logic. &quot;Two-thirds of the vote
given in this convention&quot; was the language of the rule, he argued, and
it could not mean two-thirds of all the votes originally in the
convention. Cushing admitted that a rigid construction of the rule
seemed to refer to the votes cast on the ballot in this convention,
but &quot;the chair is not of the opinion,&quot; he said, &quot;that the words of the
rule apply to the votes cast for the candidate, but to two-thirds of
all the votes to be cast by the convention.&quot; This ruling in nowise
influenced the solid delegations of Douglas' devoted followers from
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota; and
if Richmond had been as loyal in his support, it was reasoned, New
York would have followed the Northwestern States. But Cushing's ruling
afforded Richmond a technical peg upon which to hang a reason for not
deliberately and decisively cutting off the Empire State from the
possibilities of a presidential nomination, and, apparently without
any scruples whatever, he decided that the nominee must receive the
equivalent of two-thirds of the electoral college.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.278" id="Page_ii.278">ii. 278</a></span> that
vote one can no more think of Richmond or the majority of his
delegation as inspired with devoted loyalty to Douglas. One delegate
declared that it sounded like clods falling upon the Little Giant's
coffin.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Little enthusiasm developed over the naming of candidates. Six were
placed in nomination&#8212;Douglas of Illinois, Guthrie of Kentucky, Hunter
of Virginia, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, Lane of Oregon, and
Dickinson of New York. George W. Patrick of California named
Dickinson, and on the first ballot he received two votes from
Pennsylvania, one from Virginia, and four from California, while New
York cast its thirty-five votes for Douglas with as much &#233;clat as if
it had not just made his nomination absolutely impossible.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The
result gave Douglas 145&#189; to 107&#189; for all others, with 202
necessary to a choice. On the thirty-third ballot, Douglas, amidst
some enthusiasm, reached 152&#189; votes, equivalent to a majority of
the electoral college; but, as the balloting proceeded, it became
manifest that this was his limit, and on the ninth day motions to
adjourn to New York or Baltimore in June became frequent. The
fifty-seventh ballot, the last of the session, gave Douglas 151&#189;,
Guthrie 65&#189;, Dickinson 4, and all others 31. Dickinson had
flickered between half a vote and sixteen, with an average of five.
Never perhaps in the history of political conventions did an ambitious
candidate keep so far from the goal of success.</p>

<p>It was now apparent that the convention could not longer survive. The
listless delegates, the absence of enthusiasm, and the uncrowded
galleries, showed that all hope of a nomination was abandoned,
especially since the friends of Douglas, who could prevent the
selection of another, declared that the Illinoisan would not withdraw
under any contingency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.279" id="Page_ii.279">ii. 279</a></span> It is dreary reading, the record of the last
three days. If any further evidence were needed to show the utter
collapse of the dwindling, discouraged convention, the dejected,
despairing appearance of Richardson, until now supported by a bright
heroism and cheery good humour, would have furnished it. Accordingly,
on the tenth day of the session, it was agreed to reassemble at
Baltimore on Monday, June 18. Meantime the seceders had formed
themselves into a convention, adopted the platform recently reported
by the majority, and adjourned to meet at Richmond on the same day.</p>

<p>Bitter thoughts filled the home-going delegates. Douglas' Northwestern
friends talked rancorously of the South; while, in their bitterness,
Yancey and his followers exulted in the defeat of the Illinois
Senator. &quot;Men will be cutting one another's throats in a little
while,&quot; said Alexander H. Stephens. &quot;In less than twelve months we
shall be in war, and that the bloodiest in history. Men seem to be
utterly blinded to the future.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>&quot;Do you not think matters may be adjusted at Baltimore?&quot; asked R.M.
Johnston. &quot;Not the slightest chance of it,&quot; was the reply. &quot;The party
is split forever. Douglas will not retire from the stand he has taken.
The only hope was at Charleston. If the party would be satisfied with
the Cincinnati platform and would cordially nominate Douglas, we
should carry the election; but I repeat to you that is
impossible.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Between the conventions the controversy moved to the floor of the
United States Senate. &quot;We claim protection for slavery in the
territories,&quot; said Jefferson Davis, &quot;first, because it is our right;
secondly, because it is the duty of the general government.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In
replying to Davis several days later, Douglas said: &quot;My name never
would have been presented at Charleston except for the attempt to
proscribe me as a heretic, too unsound to be the chairman of a
committee in this body, where I have held a seat for so many years
without a suspicion resting on my political fidelity. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.280" id="Page_ii.280">ii. 280</a></span> forced to
allow my name to go there in self-defence; and I will now say that had
any gentleman, friend or foe, received a majority of that convention
over me the lightning would have carried a message withdrawing my
name.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>A few days afterward Davis referred to the matter again. &quot;I have a
declining respect for platforms,&quot; he said. &quot;I would sooner have an
honest man on any sort of a rickety platform you could construct than
to have a man I did not trust on the best platform which could be
made.&quot; This stung Douglas. &quot;If the platform is not a matter of much
consequence,&quot; he demanded, &quot;why press that question to the disruption
of the party? Why did you not tell us in the beginning of this debate
that the whole fight was against the man and not upon the
platform?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>These personalities served to deepen the exasperation of the sections.
The real strain was to come, and there was great need that cool heads
and impersonal argument should prevail over misrepresentation and
passion. But the coming event threw its shadow before it.</p>

SEWARD DEFEATED AT CHICAGO<br />
<br />
1860</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Republican national convention met at Chicago on May 16. It was
the prototype of the modern convention. In 1856, an ordinary hall in
Philadelphia, with a seating capacity of two thousand, sufficed to
accommodate delegates and spectators, but in 1860 the large building,
called a &quot;wigwam,&quot; specially erected for the occasion and capable of
holding ten thousand, could not receive one-half the people seeking
admission, while marching clubs, bands of music, and spacious
headquarters for state delegations, marked the new order of things. As
usual in later years, New York made an imposing demonstration. The
friends of Seward took an entire hotel, and an organised, well-drilled
body of men from New York City, under the lead of Tom Hyer, a noted
pugilist, headed by a gaily uniformed band, paraded the streets amidst
admiring crowds. For the first time, too, office-seekers were present
in force at a Republican convention; and, to show their devotion, they
packed hotel corridors and the convention hall itself with bodies of
men who vociferously cheered every mention of their candidate's name.
Such tactics are well understood and expected nowadays, but in 1860
they were unique.</p>

<p>The convention, consisting of 466 delegates, represented one southern,
five border, and eighteen free States. &quot;As long as conventions shall
be held,&quot; wrote Horace Greeley, &quot;I believe no abler, wiser, more
unselfish body of delegates will ever be assembled than that which met
at Chicago.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Gov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.282" id="Page_ii.282">ii. 282</a></span>ernor Morgan, as chairman of the Republican
national committee, called the convention to order, presenting David
Wilmot, author of the famous proviso, for temporary chairman. George
Ashmun of Massachusetts, the favourite friend of Webster, became
permanent president. The platform, adopted by a unanimous vote on the
second day, denounced the Harper's Ferry invasion &quot;as among the
gravest of crimes;&quot; declared the doctrine of popular sovereignty &quot;a
deception and fraud;&quot; condemned the attempt of President Buchanan to
force the Lecompton Constitution upon Kansas; denied &quot;the authority of
Congress, of a territorial legislature, or of an individual to give
legal existence to slavery in any territory;&quot; demanded a liberal
homestead law; and favoured a tariff &quot;to encourage the development of
the industrial interests of the whole country.&quot; The significant
silence as to personal liberty bills, the Dred Scott decision, the
fugitive slave law, and the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia, evidenced the handiwork of practical men.</p>

<p>Only one incident disclosed the enthusiasm of delegates for the
doctrine which affirms the equality and defines the rights of man.
Joshua E. Giddings sought to incorporate the sentiment that &quot;all men
are created free and equal,&quot; but the convention declined to accept it
until the eloquence of George William Curtis carried it amidst
deafening applause. It was not an easy triumph. Party leaders had
preserved the platform from radical utterances; and, with one
disapproving yell, the convention tabled the Giddings amendment.
Instantly Curtis renewed the motion; and when it drowned his voice, he
stood with folded arms and waited. At last, the chairman's gavel gave
him another chance. In the calm, his musical voice, in tones that
penetrated and thrilled, begged the representatives of the party of
freedom &quot;to think well before, upon the free prairies of the West, in
the summer of 1860, you dare to shrink from repeating the words of the
great men of 1776.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The audience, stirred by an unwonted emotion,
applauded the sentiment, and then adopted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.283" id="Page_ii.283">ii. 283</a></span> amendment with a shout
more unanimous than had been the vote of disapproval.</p>

<p>The selection of a candidate for President occupied the third day.
Friends of Seward who thronged the city exhibited absolute
confidence.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> They represented not only the discipline of the
machine, with its well-drilled cohorts, called the &quot;irrepressibles,&quot;
and its impressive marching clubs, gay with banners and badges, but
the ablest leaders on the floor of the convention. And back of all,
stood Thurlow Weed, the matchless manager, whose adroitness and wisdom
had been crowned with success for a whole generation. &quot;He is one of
the most remarkable men of our time,&quot; wrote Samuel Bowles, in the
preceding February. &quot;He is cool, calculating, a man of expedients, who
boasts that for thirty years he had not in political affairs let his
heart outweigh his judgment.&quot; Governor Edwin D. Morgan and Henry J.
Raymond were his lieutenants, William M. Evarts, his floor manager,
and a score of men whose names were soon to become famous acted as his
assistants. The brilliant rhetoric of George William Curtis, when
insisting upon an indorsement of the Declaration of Independence, gave
the opposition a taste of their mettle.</p>

<p>Seward, confident of the nomination, had sailed for Europe in May,
1859, in a happy frame of mind. The only serious opposition had come
from the <i>Tribune</i> and from the Keystone State; but on the eve of his
departure Simon Cameron assured him of Pennsylvania, and Greeley,
apparently reconciled, had dined with him at the Astor House. &quot;The sky
is bright, and the waters are calm,&quot; was the farewell to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.284" id="Page_ii.284">ii. 284</a></span>
wife.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> After his return there came an occasional shadow. &quot;I hear
of so many fickle and timid friends,&quot; he wrote;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> yet he had
confidence in Greeley, who, while calling with Weed, exhibited such
friendly interest that Seward afterward resented the suggestion of his
disloyalty.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> On reaching Auburn to await the action of the
convention, his confidence of success found expression in the belief
that he would not again return to Congress during that session. As the
work of the convention progressed his friends became more sanguine.
The solid delegations of New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
California, and Kansas, supplemented by the expected votes of New
England and other States on a second roll call, made the nomination
certain. Edward Bates had Missouri, Delaware, and Oregon, but their
votes barely equalled one-half of New York's; Lincoln was positively
sure of only Illinois, and several of its delegates preferred Seward;
Chase had failed to secure the united support of Ohio, and Dayton in
New Jersey was without hope. Cameron held Pennsylvania in reversion
for the New York Senator. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.285" id="Page_ii.285">ii. 285</a></span> hopeless did the success of the
opposition appear at midnight of the second day, that Greeley
telegraphed the <i>Tribune</i> predicting Seward's nomination, and the
&quot;irrepressibles&quot; anticipated victory in three hundred bottles of
champagne. As late as the morning of the third day, the confidence of
the Seward managers impelled them to ask whom the opposition preferred
for Vice President.</p>

<p>But opponents had been industriously at work. They found that
Republicans of Know-Nothing antecedents, especially in Pennsylvania,
still disliked Seward's opposition to their Order, and that
conservative Republicans recoiled from his doctrine of the higher law
and the irrepressible conflict. Upon this broad foundation of unrest,
the opposition adroitly builded, poisoning the minds of unsettled
delegates with stories of his political methods and too close
association with Thurlow Weed. No one questioned Seward's personal
integrity; but the distrust of the political boss existed then as much
as now, and his methods were no less objectionable. &quot;The
misconstruction put on his phrase 'the irrepressible conflict between
freedom and slavery' has, I think, damaged him a good deal,&quot; wrote
William Cullen Bryant, &quot;and in this city there is one thing which has
damaged him still more. I mean the project of Thurlow Weed to give
charters for a set of city railways, for which those who receive them
are to furnish a fund of from four to six hundred thousand dollars, to
be expended for the Republican cause in the next presidential
election.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Such a scheme would be rebuked even in this day of
trust and corporation giving. People resented the transfer to
Washington of the peculiar state of things at Albany, and when James
S. Pike wrote of Seward's close connection with men who schemed for
public grants, it recalled his belief in the adage that &quot;Money makes
the mare go.&quot; Allusion to Seward's &quot;bad associates,&quot; as Bryant called
them, and to the connection between &quot;Seward stock&quot; and &quot;New York
street railroads&quot; had become frequent in the correspondence of leading
men, and now, when delegates could talk face to face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.286" id="Page_ii.286">ii. 286</a></span> in the
confidence of the party council chamber, these accusations made a
profound impression. The presence of Tom Hyer and his rough marchers
did not tend to eliminate these moral objections. &quot;If you do not
nominate Seward, where will you get your money?&quot; was their stock
argument.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Horace Greeley, sitting as a delegate from Oregon, stayed with the
friends of Bates and Lincoln at the Tremont Hotel. The announcement
startled the New Yorkers. He had visited Weed at Albany on his way to
Chicago, leaving the impression that he would support Seward,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> but
once in the convention city his disaffection became quickly known. Of
all the members of the convention none attracted more attention, or
had greater influence with the New England and Western delegates. His
peculiar head and dress quickly identified him as he passed through
the hotel corridors from delegation to delegation, and whenever he
stopped to speak, an eager crowd of listeners heard his reasons why
Seward could not carry the doubtful States. He marshalled all the
facts and forgot no accusing rumour. His remarkable letter of 1854,
dissolving the firm of Weed, Seward, and Greeley, had not then been
published, leaving him in the position of a patriot and prophet who
opposed the Senator because he sincerely believed him a weak
candidate. &quot;If we have ever demurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.287" id="Page_ii.287">ii. 287</a></span> to his nomination,&quot; he said in
the <i>Tribune</i> of April 23, in reply to the <i>Times'</i> charge of
hostility, &quot;it has been on the ground of his too near approximation in
principle and sentiment to our standard to be a safe candidate just
yet. We joyfully believe that the country is acquiring a just and
adequate conception of the malign influence exerted by the slave power
upon its character, its reputation, its treatment of its neighbour,
and all its great moral and material interests. In a few years more we
believe it will be ready to elect as its President a man who not only
sees but proclaims the whole truth in this respect&#8212;in short, such a
man as Governor Seward. We have certainly doubted its being yet so far
advanced in its political education as to be ready to choose for
President one who looks the slave oligarchy square in the eye and
says, 'Know me as your enemy.'&quot;</p>

<p>Greeley favoured Bates of Missouri, but was ready to support anybody
to beat Seward. Bryant, disliking what he called the &quot;pliant politics&quot;
of the New York Senator, had been disposed to favour Chase until the
Cooper Institute speech. Lincoln left a similar trail of friends
through New England. The Illinoisan's title of &quot;Honest Old Abe,&quot;
given, him by his neighbours, contrasted favourably with the whispered
reports of &quot;bad associates&quot; and the &quot;New York City railroad scheme.&quot;
Gradually, even the radical element in the unpledged delegations began
questioning the advisability of the New Yorker's selection, and when,
on the night preceding the nomination, Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania
and Henry S. Lane<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of Indiana, candidates for governor in their
respective States, whose defeat in October would probably bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.288" id="Page_ii.288">ii. 288</a></span>
defeat in November, declared that Seward's selection would cost them
their election, the opposition occupied good vantage ground. David
Davis, the Illinois manager for Lincoln, against the positive
instructions of his principal, strengthened these declarations by
promising to locate Simon Cameron and Caleb B. Smith in the Cabinet.
The next morning, however, the anti-Seward forces entered the
convention without having concentrated upon a candidate. Lincoln had
won Indiana, but Pennsylvania and Ohio were divided; New Jersey stood
for Dayton; Bates still controlled Missouri, Delaware, and Oregon.</p>

<p>William M. Evarts presented Seward's name amidst loud applause. But at
the mention of Lincoln's the vigour of the cheers surprised the
delegates. The Illinois managers had cunningly filled the desirable
seats with their shouters, excluding Tom Hyer and his marchers, who
arrived too late, so that, although the applause for Seward was
&quot;frantic, shrill, and wild,&quot; says one correspondent, the cheers for
Lincoln were &quot;louder and more terrible.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Whether this had the
influence ascribed to it at the time by Henry J. Raymond and others
has been seriously questioned, but it undoubtedly aided in fixing the
wavering delegates, and in encouraging the friends of other candidates
to rally about the Lincoln standard.</p>

<p>The first roll call proved a disappointment to Seward. Though the
pledged States were in line, New England fell short, Pennsylvania
showed indifference, and Virginia created a profound surprise.
Nevertheless, the confidence of the Seward forces remained unshaken.
Of the 465 votes, Seward had 173&#189;, Lincoln 102, Cameron 50&#189;,
Chase 49, and Bates 48, with 42 for seven others; necessary to a
choice, 233. On the second ballot Seward gained four votes from New
Jersey, two each from Texas and Kentucky, and one each from
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska&#8212;making a total of 184&#189;.
Lincoln moved up to 133. The action of Ohio in giving fourteen votes
to Lincoln had been no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.289" id="Page_ii.289">ii. 289</a></span> disappointing to the Seward managers than
the transfer of Vermont's vote to the same column; but, before they
could recover from this shock, Cameron was withdrawn and 48 votes from
Pennsylvania carried Lincoln's total to 181.</p>

<p>The announcement of this change brought the convention to its feet
amid scenes of wild excitement. Seward's forces endeavoured to avert
the danger, but the arguments of a week were bearing fruit. As the
third roll call proceeded, the scattering votes turned to Lincoln.
Seward lost four from Rhode Island and half a vote from Pennsylvania,
giving him 180, Lincoln 231&#189;, Chase 24&#189;, Bates 22, and 7 for
three others. At this moment, an Ohio delegate authorised a change of
four votes from Chase to Lincoln, and instantly one hundred guns,
fired from the top of an adjoining building, announced the nomination
of &quot;Honest Old Abe.&quot; In a short speech of rare felicity and great
strength, William M. Evarts moved to make the nomination unanimous.</p>

<p>The New York delegation, stunned by the result, declined the honour of
naming a candidate for Vice President; and, on reassembling in the
afternoon, the convention nominated Hannibal Hamlin of Maine. As
Evarts was leaving the wigwam he remarked, with characteristic humour:
&quot;Well, Curtis, at least we have saved the Declaration of
Independence!&quot;</p>

<p>Three days after the nomination Greeley wrote James S. Pike:
&quot;Massachusetts was right in Weed's hands, contrary to all reasonable
expectation. It was all we could do to hold Vermont by the most
desperate exertions; and I at some times despaired of it. The rest of
New England was pretty sound, but part of New Jersey was somehow
inclined to sin against the light and knowledge. If you had seen the
Pennsylvania delegation, and known how much money Weed had in hand,
you would not have believed we could do so well as we did. Give Curtin
thanks for that. Ohio looked very bad, yet turned out well, and
Virginia had been regularly sold out; but the seller could not
deliver. We had to rain red-hot bolts on them, however, to keep the
majority from going for Seward, who got eight votes here as it was.
Indiana was our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.290" id="Page_ii.290">ii. 290</a></span> right bower, and Missouri above praise. It was a
fearful week, such as I hope and trust I shall never see
repeated.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> That Greeley received credit for all he did is
evidenced by a letter from John D. Defrees, then a leading politician
of Indiana, addressed to Schuyler Colfax. &quot;Greeley slaughtered Seward
and saved the party,&quot; he wrote. &quot;He deserves the praises of all men
and gets them now. Wherever he goes he is greeted with cheers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>The profound sorrow of Seward's friends resembled the distress of
Henry Clay's supporters in 1840. It was not chagrin; it was not the
selfish fear that considers the loss of office or spoils; it was not
discouragement or despair. Apprehensions for the future of the party
and the country there may have been, but their grief found its
fountain-head in the feeling that &quot;his fidelity to the country, the
Constitution and the laws,&quot; as Evarts put it; &quot;his fidelity to the
party, and the principle that the majority govern; his interest in the
advancement of our party to victory, that our country may rise to its
true glory,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> had led to his sacrifice solely for assumed
availability. The belief obtained that a large majority of the
delegates preferred him, and that had the convention met elsewhere he
would probably have been successful. In his <i>Life of Lincoln</i>, Alex.
K. McClure of Pennsylvania, an anti-Seward delegate, says that &quot;of the
two hundred and thirty-one men who voted for Lincoln on the third and
last ballot, not less than one hundred of them voted reluctantly
against the candidate of their choice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>At Auburn a funeral gloom settled upon the town.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.291" id="Page_ii.291">ii. 291</a></span>miration for
Seward's great ability, and a just pride in the exalted position he
occupied in his party and before the country, had long ago displaced
the local spirit that refused him a seat in the constitutional
convention of 1846; and after the defeat his fellow townsmen could not
be comforted. Sincere sorrow filled their hearts. But Seward's bearing
was heroic. When told that no Republican could be found to write a
paragraph for the evening paper announcing and approving the
nominations, he quickly penned a dozen lines eulogistic of the
convention and its work. To Weed, who shed bitter tears, he wrote
consolingly. &quot;I wish I were sure that your sense of disappointment is
as light as my own,&quot; he said. &quot;It ought to be equally so, if we have
been equally thoughtful and zealous for friends, party, and country. I
know not what has been left undone that could have been done, or done
that ought to be regretted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> During the week many friends from
distant parts of the State called upon him, &quot;not to console,&quot; as they
expressed it, &quot;but to be consoled.&quot; His cheerful demeanour under a
disappointment so overwhelming to everybody else excited the inquiry
how he could exhibit such control. His reply was characteristic. &quot;For
twenty years,&quot; he said, &quot;I have been breasting a daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.292" id="Page_ii.292">ii. 292</a></span> storm of
censure. Now, all the world seems disposed to speak kindly of me. In
that pile of papers, Republican and Democratic, you will find hardly
one unkind word. When I went to market this morning I confess I was
unprepared for so much real grief as I heard expressed at every
corner.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>But deep in his heart despondency reigned supreme. &quot;The reappearance
at Washington in the character of a leader deposed by his own party,
in the hour of organisation for decisive battle, thank God is
past&#8212;and so the last of the humiliations has been endured,&quot; he wrote
his wife. &quot;Preston King met me at the depot and conveyed me to my
home. It seemed sad and mournful. Dr. Nott's benevolent face, Lord
Napier's complacent one, Jefferson's benignant one, and Lady Napier's
loving one, seemed all like pictures of the dead. Even 'Napoleon at
Fontainebleau' seemed more frightfully desolate than ever. At the
Capitol the scene was entirely changed from my entrance into the
chamber last winter. Cameron greeted me kindly; Wilkinson of
Minnesota, and Sumner cordially and manfully. Other Republican
senators came to me, but in a manner that showed a consciousness of
embarrassment, which made the courtesy a conventional one; only Wilson
came half a dozen times, and sat down by me. Mason, Gwin, Davis, and
most of the Democrats, came to me with frank, open, sympathising
words, thus showing that their past prejudices had been buried in the
victory they had achieved over me. Good men came through the day to
see me, and also this morning. Their eyes fill with tears, and they
become speechless as they speak of what they call 'ingratitude.' They
console themselves with the vain hope of a day of 'vindication,' and
my letters all talk of the same thing. But they awaken no response in
my heart. I have not shrunk from any fiery trial prepared for me by
the enemies of my cause. But I shall not hold myself bound to try, a
second time, the magnanimity of its friends.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> To Weed he wrote:
&quot;Private life, as soon as I can reach it without grieving or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.293" id="Page_ii.293">ii. 293</a></span>
embarrassing my friends, will be welcome to me. It will come the 4th
of next March in my case, and I am not unprepared.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Defeat was a severe blow to Seward. For the moment he seemed well-nigh
friendless. The letter to his wife after he reached Washington was a
threnody. He was firmly convinced that he was a much injured man, and
his attitude was that of the martyr supported by the serenity of the
saint. But to the world he bore himself with the courage and the
dignity that belong to one whose supremacy is due to superiority of
talents. The country could not know that he was to become a secretary
of state of whom the civilised world would take notice; but one of
Seward's prescience must have felt well satisfied in his own mind,
even when telling Weed how &quot;welcome&quot; private life would be, that,
although he was not to become President, he was at the opening of a
greater political career.</p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> recess between the Charleston and Baltimore conventions did not
allay hostilities. Jefferson Davis' criticism and Douglas' tart
retorts transferred the quarrel to the floor of the United States
Senate, and by the time the delegates had reassembled at Baltimore on
June 18, 1860, the factions exhibited greater exasperation than had
been shown at Charleston. Yet the Douglas men seemed certain of
success. Dean Richmond, it was said, had been engaged in private
consultation with Douglas and his friends, pledging himself to stand
by them to the last. On the other hand, rumours of a negotiation in
which the Southerners and the Administration at Washington had offered
the New Yorkers their whole strength for any man the Empire State
might name other than Douglas and Guthrie, found ready belief among
the Northwestern delegates. It was surmised, too, that the defeat of
Seward at Chicago had strengthened the chances of Horatio Seymour, on
the ground that the disappointed and discontented Seward Republicans
would allow him to carry the State. Whatever truth there may have been
in these reports, all admitted that the New York delegation had in its
hands the destiny of the convention, if not that of the party
itself.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.295" id="Page_ii.295">ii. 295</a></span></p>
<p>The apparent breaking point at Charleston was the adoption of a
platform; at Baltimore it was the readmission of seceding delegates.
Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas presented their original
delegations, who sought immediate admission; but a resolution,
introduced by Sanford E. Church of New York, referred them to the
committee on credentials, with the understanding that persons
accepting seats were bound in honour to abide the action of the
convention. The Douglas men, greeting this resolution with tremendous
applause, proposed driving it through without debate; but New York
hesitated to order the previous question. Then it asked permission to
withdraw for consultation, and when it finally voted in the negative,
deeming it unwise to stifle debate, it revealed the fact that its
action was decisive on all questions.</p>

<p>An amendment to the Church resolution proposed sending only contested
seats to the credentials committee, without conditions as to loyalty,
and over this joinder of issues some very remarkable speeches
disclosed malignant bitterness rather than choice rhetoric.
Richardson, still the recognised spokesman of Douglas, received marked
attention as he argued boldly that the amendment admitted delegates
not sent there, and decided a controversy without a hearing. &quot;I do not
propose,&quot; he said, &quot;to sit side by side with delegates who do not
represent the people; who are not bound by anything, when I am bound
by everything. We are not so hard driven yet as to be compelled to
elect delegates from States that do not choose to send any here.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Russell of Virginia responded, declaring that his State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.296" id="Page_ii.296">ii. 296</a></span> intended, in
the interest of fair play, to cling to the Democracy of the South. &quot;If
we are to be constrained to silence,&quot; he vociferated, &quot;I beg gentlemen
to consider the silence of Virginia ominous. If we are not
gentlemen&#8212;if we are such knaves that we cannot trust one another&#8212;we
had better scatter at once, and cease to make any effort to bind each
other.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Speaking on similar lines, Ewing of Tennessee asked what
was meant. &quot;Have you no enemy in front? Have you any States to spare?
We are pursued by a remorseless enemy, and yet from all quarters of
this convention come exclamations of bitterness and words that burn,
with a view to open the breach in our ranks wider and wider, until at
last, Curtius-like, we will be compelled to leap into it to close it
up.&quot;</p>

<p>But it remained for Montgomery of Pennsylvania, in spite of Cochrane's
conciliatory words, to raise the political atmosphere to the
temperature at Charleston just before the secession. &quot;For the first
time in the history of the Democratic party,&quot; he said, &quot;a number of
delegations of sovereign States, by a solemn instrument in writing,
resigned their places upon the floor of the convention. They went out
with a protest, not against a candidate, but against the principles of
a party, declaring they did not hold and would not support them. And
not only that, but they called a hostile convention, and sat side by
side with us, deliberating upon a candidate and the adoption of a
platform. Principles hostile to ours were asserted and a nomination
hostile to ours was threatened. Our convention was compelled to
adjourn in order to have these sovereign States represented. What
became of the gentlemen who seceded? They adjourned to meet at
Richmond. Now they seek to come back and sit upon this floor with us,
and to-day they threaten us if we do not come to their terms. God
knows I love the star spangled banner of my country, and it is because
I love the Union that I am determined that any man who arrays himself
in hostility to it shall not, with my consent, take a seat in this
convention. I am opposed to secession either from this Union or from
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.297" id="Page_ii.297">ii. 297</a></span> Democratic convention, and when men declare the principles of the
party are not their principles, and that they will neither support
them nor stay in a convention that promulgates them, then I say it is
high time, if they ask to come back, that they shall declare they have
changed their minds.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>This swung the door of vituperative debate wide open, and after an
adjournment had closed it in the hall, the crowds continued it in the
street. At midnight, while Yancey made one of his silver-toned
speeches, which appears, by all accounts, to have been a piece of
genuine eloquence, the friends of Douglas, on the opposite side of
Monument Square, kept the bands playing and crowds cheering.</p>

<p>When the convention assembled on the second day, Church, in the
interest of harmony, withdrew the last clause of his resolution, and,
without a dissenting voice, all contested seats went to the committee
on credentials. Then the convention impatiently waited three days for
a report, while the night meetings, growing noisier and more arrogant,
served to increase the bitterness. The Douglasites denounced their
opponents as &quot;disorganisers and disunionists;&quot; the Southerners
retorted by calling them &quot;a species of sneaking abolitionists.&quot; Yancey
spoke of them as small men, with selfish aims. &quot;They are
ostrich-like&#8212;their head is in the sand of squatter sovereignty, and
they do not know their great, ugly, ragged abolition body is exposed.&quot;</p>

<p>On the fourth day, the committee presented two reports, the majority,
without argument, admitting the contestants&#8212;the minority, in a
remarkably strong document of singular skill and great clearness,
seating the seceders on the ground that their withdrawal was not a
resignation and was not so considered by the convention. A
resignation, it argued, must be made to the appointing power. The
withdrawing delegates desired the instruction of their constituencies,
who authorised them in every case except South Carolina to repair to
Baltimore and endeavour once more to unite their party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.298" id="Page_ii.298">ii. 298</a></span> and promote
harmony and peace in the great cause of their country.</p>

<p>This report made a profound impression upon the convention, and the
motion to substitute it for the majority report at once threw New York
into confusion. That delegation had already decided to sustain the
majority, but the views of the seceders, so ably and logically
presented, had reopened the door of debate, and a resolute minority,
combining more than a proportionate share of the talent and worth of
the delegation, insisted upon further time. After the convention had
grudgingly taken a recess to accommodate the New Yorkers, William H.
Ludlow reappeared and apologised for asking more time. This created
the impression that Richmond's delegation, at the last moment,
proposed to slaughter Douglas<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> as it did at Charleston, and the
latter's friends, maddened and disheartened over what they called &quot;New
York's dishonest and cowardly procrastination,&quot; would gladly have
prevented an adjournment. But the Empire State held the key to the
situation. Without it Douglas could get nothing and in a hopeless sort
of way his backers granted Ludlow's request.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The situation of the New York delegation was undoubtedly most
embarrassing. Their admission to the Charleston convention had
depended upon the Douglas vote, but their hope of success hinged upon
harmony with the cotton States. A formidable minority favoured the
readmission of the seceders and the abandonment of Douglas regardless
of their obligation. This was not the policy of Dean Richmond, who
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.299" id="Page_ii.299">ii. 299</a></span> the pivotal personage. His plan included the union of the party
by admitting the seceders, and the nomination of Horatio Seymour with
the consent of the Northwest, after rendering the selection of Douglas
impossible. It was a brilliant programme, but the inexorable demand of
the Douglas men presented a fatal drawback. Richmond implored and
pleaded. He knew the hostility of the Douglasites could make Seymour's
nomination impossible, and he knew, also, that a refusal to admit the
seceders would lead to a second secession, a second ticket, and a
hopelessly divided party. Nevertheless, the Douglas men were
remorseless.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Even Douglas' letter, sent Richardson on the third
day, and his dispatch to Dean Richmond,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> received on the fifth
day, authorising the withdrawal of his name if it could be done
without sacrificing the principle of non-intervention, did not relieve
the situation. Rule or ruin was now their motto, as much as it was the
South's, and between them Richmond's diplomatic resistance,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> which
once seemed of iron, became as clay. Neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.300" id="Page_ii.300">ii. 300</a></span>less, Richmond's control
of the New York delegation remained unbroken. The minority tried new
arguments, planned new combinations, and racked their brains for new
devices, but when Richmond finally gave up the hopeless and thankless
task of harmonising the Douglasites and seceders, a vote of 27 to 43
forced the minority of the delegation into submission by the screw of
the Syracuse unit rule, and New York finally sustained the majority
report.</p>

<p>After this, the convention became the theatre of a dramatic event
which made it, for the moment, the centre of interest to the political
world. The majority report seated the Douglas faction from Alabama and
Louisiana, and then excluded William L. Yancey, a representative
seceder, and let in Pierre Soul&#233;, a representative Douglasite. It is
sufficient proof of the sensitiveness of the relations between the two
factions that an expressed preference for one of these men should
again disrupt the convention, but the moving cause was far deeper than
the majority's action. Yancey belonged to the daring, resolute, and
unscrupulous band of men who, under the unhappy conditions that
threatened their defeat, had already decided upon disunion; and, when
the convention repudiated him, the lesser lights played their part.
Virginia led a new secession, followed by most of the delegates from
North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Maryland, and
finally by Caleb Cushing himself, the astute presiding officer, whose
action anticipated the withdrawal of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>When they were gone, Pierre Soul&#233; took the floor and made the speech
of the convention, fascinating all who saw and heard. An eye-witness
speaks of his rolling, glittering, eagle eye, Napoleonic head and
face, sharp voice with a margin of French accent, and piercing,
intense earnestness of manner. &quot;I have not been at all discouraged,&quot;
he said, &quot;by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.301" id="Page_ii.301">ii. 301</a></span> emotion which has been attempted to be created in
this body by those who have seceded from it. We from the furthest
South were prepared; we had heard the rumours which were to be
initiatory of the exit which you have witnessed on this day, and we
knew that conspiracy, which had been brooding for months past, would
break out on this occasion, and for the purposes which are obvious to
every member. Sirs, there are in political life men who were once
honoured by popular favour, who consider that the favour has become to
them an inalienable property, and who cling to it as to something that
can no longer be wrested from their hands&#8212;political fossils so much
incrusted in office that there is hardly any power that can extract
them. They saw that the popular voice was already manifesting to this
glorious nation who was to be her next ruler. Instead of bringing a
candidate to oppose him; instead of creating issues upon which the
choice of the nation could be enlightened; instead of principles
discussed, what have we seen? An unrelenting war against the
individual presumed to be the favourite of the nation! a war waged by
an army of unprincipled and unscrupulous politicians, leagued with a
power which could not be exerted on their side without disgracing
itself and disgracing the nation.&quot; Secession, he declared, meant
disunion, &quot;but the people of the South will not respond to the call of
the secessionists.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The effect of Soul&#233;'s speech greatly animated and reassured the
friends of Douglas, who now received 173&#189; of the 190&#189; votes
cast. Dickinson got half a vote from Virginia, and Horatio Seymour one
vote from Pennsylvania. At the mention of the latter's name, David P.
Bissell of Utica promptly withdrew it upon the authority of a letter,
in which Seymour briefly but positively declared that under no
circumstances could he be a candidate for President or Vice President.
On the second ballot, Douglas received all the votes but thirteen.
This was not two-thirds of the original vote, but, in spite of the
resolution which Dean Richmond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.302" id="Page_ii.302">ii. 302</a></span> passed at Charleston, Douglas was
declared, amidst great enthusiasm, the nominee of the convention,
since two-thirds of the delegates present had voted for him. Benjamin
Fitzpatrick, United States senator from Alabama, was then nominated
for Vice President. When he afterwards declined, the national
committee appointed Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia in his place.</p>

<p>Meantime the Baltimore seceders, joined by their seceding colleagues
from Charleston, met elsewhere in the city, adopted the Richmond
platform, and nominated John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky for
President, and Joseph Lane of Oregon for Vice President. A few days
later the Richmond convention indorsed these nominations.</p>

<p>After the return of the New York delegation, the gagged minority,
through the lips of Daniel S. Dickinson, told the story of the
majority's purpose at Charleston and Baltimore. Dickinson was not
depressed or abashed by his failure; neither was he a man to be rudely
snuffed out or bottled up; and, although his speech at the Cooper
Institute mass-meeting, called to ratify the Breckenridge and Lane
ticket, revealed a vision clouded with passion and prejudice, it
clearly disclosed the minority's estimate of the cardinal object of
Dean Richmond's majority. &quot;Waiving all questions of the merits or
demerits of Mr. Douglas as a candidate,&quot; he said, his silken white
hair bringing into greater prominence the lines of a handsome face,
&quot;his pretensions were pressed upon the convention in a tone and
temper, and with a dogged and obstinate persistence, which was well
calculated, if it was not intended, to break up the convention, or
force it into obedience to the behests of a combination. The authors
of this outrage, who are justly and directly chargeable with it, were
the ruling majority of the New York delegation. They held the balance
of power, and madly and selfishly and corruptly used it for the
disruption of the Democratic party in endeavouring to force it to
subserve their infamous schemes. They were charged with high
responsibilities in a crisis of unusual interest in our history, and
in an evil moment their leprous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.303" id="Page_ii.303">ii. 303</a></span> hands held the destinies of a noble
party. They proclaimed personally and through their accredited organs
that the Southern States were entitled to name a candidate, but from
the moment they entered the convention at Charleston until it was
finally broken up at Baltimore by their base conduct and worse faith,
their every act was to oppose any candidate who would be acceptable to
those States.</p>

<p>&quot;Those who controlled the New York delegation through the fraudulent
process of a unit vote&#8212;a rule forced upon a large minority to stifle
their sentiments&#8212;will hereafter be known as political gamblers. The
Democratic party of New York, founded in the spirit of Jefferson, has,
in the hands of these gamblers, been disgraced by practices which
would dishonour a Peter Funk cast-off clothing resort; cheating the
people of the State, cheating a great and confiding party, cheating
the convention which admitted them to seats, cheating delegations who
trusted them, cheating everybody with whom they came in contact, and
then lamenting from day to day, through their accredited organ, that
the convention had not remained together so that they might finally
have cheated Douglas. Political gamblers! You have perpetrated your
last cheat&#8212;consummated your last fraud upon the Democratic party.
Henceforth you will be held and treated as political outlaws. There is
no fox so crafty but his hide finally goes to the hatter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>In his political controversies, Dickinson acted on the principle that
an opponent is necessarily a blockhead or a scoundrel. But there was
little or no truth in his severe arraignment. Richmond's purpose was
plainly to nominate Horatio Seymour if it could be done with the
consent of the Northwestern States, and his sudden affection for a
two-thirds rule came from a determination to prolong the convention
until it yielded consent. At no time did he intend leaving Douglas for
any one other than Seymour. On the other hand, Dickinson had always
favoured slavery.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.304" id="Page_ii.304">ii. 304</a></span> the Wilmot Proviso nor the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise disturbed him. What slavery demanded he
granted; what freedom sought he denounced. His belief that the South
would support him for a compromise candidate in return for his
fidelity became an hallucination. It showed itself at Cincinnati in
1852 when he antagonised Marcy; and his position in 1860 was even less
advantageous. Nevertheless, Dickinson nursed his delusion until the
guns at Fort Sumter disclosed the real design of Yancey and the men in
whom he had confided.</p>

RAYMOND, GREELEY, AND WEED<br />
<br />
1860</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">It was</span> impossible that the defeat of Seward at Chicago, so unexpected,
and so far-reaching in its effect, should be encountered without some
attempt to fix the responsibility. To Thurlow Weed's sorrow<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> was
added the mortification of defeat. He had staked everything upon
success, and, although he doubtless wished to avoid any unseemly
demonstration of disappointment, the rankling wound goaded him into a
desire to relieve himself of any lack of precaution. Henry J. Raymond
scarcely divided the responsibility of management; but his newspaper,
which had spoken for Seward, shared in the loss of prestige, while the
<i>Tribune</i>, his great rival in metropolitan journalism, disclosed
between the lines of assumed modesty an exultant attitude.</p>

<p>Greeley had played a very important part in the historic convention.
The press gave him full credit for his activity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.306" id="Page_ii.306">ii. 306</a></span> and he admitted it
in his jubilant letter to Pike; but after returning to New York he
seemed to think it wise to minimise his influence, claiming that the
result would have been the same had he remained at home. &quot;The fact
that the four conspicuous doubtful States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Indiana, and Illinois,&quot; he wrote, &quot;unanimously testified that they
could not be carried for Seward was decisive. Against this Malakoff
the most brilliant evolutions of political strategy could not
avail.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> This two-column article, modestly concealing his own
work, might not have led to an editorial war between the three great
Republican editors of the State, had not Greeley, in the exordium of a
speech, published in the <i>Tribune</i> of May 23, exceeded the limits of
human endurance. &quot;The past is dead,&quot; he said. &quot;Let the dead past bury
it, and let the mourners, if they will, go about the streets.&quot;</p>

<p>The exultant sentences exasperated Raymond, who held the opinion which
generally obtained among New York Republican leaders, that Greeley's
persistent hostility was not only responsible for Seward's defeat, but
that under the guise of loyalty to the party's highest interests he
had been insidious and revengeful, and Raymond believed it needed only
a bold and loud-spoken accusation against him to fill the mind of the
public with his guilt. In this spirit he wrote a stinging reply. &quot;With
the generosity which belongs to his nature, and which a feeling not
unlike remorse may have stimulated into unwonted activity,&quot; said this
American Junius, &quot;Mr. Greeley awards to others the credit which
belongs transcendently to himself. The main work of the Chicago
convention was the defeat of Governor Seward, and in that endeavour
Mr. Greeley laboured harder, and did tenfold more, than the whole
family of Blairs, together with all the gubernatorial candidates, to
whom he modestly hands over the honours of the effective campaign. Mr.
Greeley had special qualifications, as well as a special love, for
this task. For twenty years he had been sustaining the political
principles and vindicating the political conduct of Mr. Seward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.307" id="Page_ii.307">ii. 307</a></span>
through the columns of the most influential political newspaper in the
country. His voice was potential precisely where Governor Seward was
strongest, because it was supposed to be that of a friend, strong in
his personal attachment and devotion, and driven into opposition on
this occasion solely by the despairing conviction that the welfare of
the country and the triumph of the Republican cause demanded the
sacrifice. For more than six months Mr. Greeley had been preparing the
way for this consummation. He was in Chicago several days before the
meeting of the convention and he devoted every hour of the interval to
the most steady and relentless prosecution of the main business which
took him thither.</p>

<p>&quot;While it was known to some that nearly six years ago he had
privately, but distinctly, repudiated all further political friendship
for and alliance with Governor Seward, for the avowed reason that
Governor Seward had never aided or advised his elevation to office, no
use was made of this knowledge in quarters where it would have
disarmed the deadly effect of his pretended friendship for the man
upon whom he was thus deliberately wreaking the long hoarded revenge
of a disappointed office-seeker.... Being thus stimulated by a hatred
he had secretly cherished for years, protected by the forbearance of
those whom he assailed, and strong in the confidence of those upon
whom he sought to operate, it is not strange that Mr. Greeley's
efforts should have been crowned with success. But it is perfectly
safe to say that no other man&#8212;certainly no one occupying a position
less favourable for such an assault&#8212;could possibly have accomplished
that result.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>Raymond's letter produced a profound impression. It excited the
astonishment and incredulity of every one. He had made a distinct
charge that Greeley's opposition was the revenge of a disappointed
office-seeker, and the public, resenting the imputation, demanded the
evidence. Greeley himself echoed the prayer by a blast from his silver
trumpet which added to the interest as well as to the excitement.
&quot;This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.308" id="Page_ii.308">ii. 308</a></span> carefully drawn indictment,&quot; he said, &quot;contains a very artful
mixture of truth and misrepresentation. No intelligent reader of the
<i>Tribune</i> has for months been left in doubt of the fact that I deemed
the nomination of Governor Seward for President at this time unwise
and unsafe; and none can fail to understand that I did my best at
Chicago to prevent that nomination. My account of 'Last Week at
Chicago' is explicit on that point. True, I do not believe my
influence was so controlling as the defeated are disposed to represent
it, but this is not material to the issue. It is agreed that I did
what I could.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not true&#8212;it is grossly untrue&#8212;that at Chicago I commended
myself to the confidence of delegates 'by professions of regard and
the most zealous friendship for Governor Seward, but presented defeat,
<i>even in New York</i>, as the inevitable result of his nomination.' The
very reverse of this is the truth. I made no professions before the
nomination, as I have uttered no lamentations since. It was the simple
duty of each delegate to do just whatever was best for the Republican
cause, regardless of personal considerations. And this is exactly what
I did.... As to New York, I think I was at least a hundred times asked
whether Governor Seward could carry this State;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and I am sure I
uniformly responded affirmatively, urging delegates to consider the
New York delegation the highest authority on that point as I was
strenuously urging that the delegations from Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.309" id="Page_ii.309">ii. 309</a></span> New
Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois must be regarded as authority as to who
could and who could not carry their respective States.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Raymond proceeds to state that I had, 'in November, 1854,
privately but distinctly repudiated all further political friendship
for and alliance with Governor Seward, and menaced him with hostility
wherever it could be made most effective; for the avowed reason that
Governor Seward had never advised my elevation to office,' &amp;c. This is
a very grave charge, and, being dated 'Auburn, Tuesday, May 22, 1860,'
and written by one who was there expressly and avowedly to console
with Governor Seward on his defeat and denounce me as its author, it
is impossible not to see that Governor Seward is its responsible
source. I, therefore, call on him for the private letter which I did
write him in November, 1854, that I may print it verbatim in the
<i>Tribune</i>, and let every reader judge how far it sustains the charges
which his mouthpiece bases thereon. I maintain that it does not
sustain them; but I have no copy of the letter, and I cannot discuss
its contents while it remains in the hands of my adversaries, to be
used at their discretion. I leave to others all judgment as to the
unauthorised use which has already been made of this private and
confidential letter, only remarking that this is by no means the first
time it has been employed to like purpose. I have heard of its
contents being dispensed to members of Congress from Governor Seward's
dinner-table; I have seen articles based on it paraded in the columns
of such devoted champions of Governor Seward's principles and aims as
the Boston <i>Courier</i>. It is fit that the New York <i>Times</i> should
follow in their footsteps; but I, who am thus fired on from an ambush,
demand that the letter shall no longer be thus employed. Let me have
the letter and it shall appear verbatim in every edition of the
<i>Tribune</i>. Meantime, I only say that, when I fully decided that I
would no longer be devoted to Governor Seward's personal fortunes, it
seemed due to candour and fair dealing that I should privately but in
all frankness apprise him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.310" id="Page_ii.310">ii. 310</a></span> the fact. It was not possible that I
could in any way be profited by writing that letter; I well understood
that it involved an abdication of all hopes of political advancement;
yet it seemed due to my own character that the letter should be
written. Of course I never dreamed that it could be published, or used
as it already has been; but no matter&#8212;let us have the letter in
print, and let the public judge between its writer and his open and
covert assailants. At all events I ask no favour and fear no open
hostility.</p>

<p>&quot;There are those who will at all events believe that my opposition to
Governor Seward's nomination was impelled by personal considerations;
and among these I should expect to find the Hon. Henry J. Raymond.
With these I have no time for controversy; in their eyes I desire no
vindication. But there is another and far larger class who will
realise that the obstacles to Governor Seward's election were in no
degree of my creation, and that their removal was utterly beyond my
powers. The whole course of the <i>Tribune</i> has tended to facilitate the
elevation to the Presidency of a statesman cherishing the pronounced
anti-slavery views of Governor Seward; it is only on questions of
finance and public economy that there has been any perceptible
divergence between us. Those anti-democratic voters of Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois, who could not be induced to vote
for Governor Seward, have derived their notions of him in some measure
from the <i>Times</i>, but in no measure from the <i>Tribune</i>. The
delegations from those States, with the candidates for governor in
Pennsylvania and Indiana, whose representations and remonstrances
rendered the nomination of Governor Seward, in the eyes of all
intelligent, impartial observers, a clear act of political suicide,
were nowise instructed or impelled by me. They acted on views
deliberately formed long before they came to Chicago. It is not my
part to vindicate them; but whoever says they were influenced by me,
other than I was by them, does them the grossest injustice.</p>

<p>&quot;I wished first of all to succeed; next, to strengthen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.311" id="Page_ii.311">ii. 311</a></span> establish
our struggling brethren in the border slave States. If it had seemed
to me possible to obtain one more vote in the doubtful States for
Governor Seward than for any one else, I should have struggled for him
as ardently as I did against him, even though I had known that the
Raymonds who hang about our party were to be his trusted counsellors
and I inflexibly shut out from his confidence and favour. If there be
any who do not believe this, I neither desire their friendship nor
deprecate their hostility.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Greeley's demand for his letter did not meet with swift response. It
was made on June 2. When Seward passed through New York on his way to
Washington on the 8th, a friend of Greeley waited upon him, but he had
nothing for the <i>Tribune</i>. Days multiplied into a week, and still
nothing came. Finally, on June 13, Greeley received it through the
hands of Thurlow Weed and published it on the 14th. It bore date &quot;New
York, Saturday evening, November 11, 1854,&quot; and was addressed simply
to &quot;Governor Seward.&quot; Its great length consigned it to nonpareil in
strange contrast to the long primer type of the editorial page, but
its publication became the sensation of the hour. To this day its fine
thought-shading is regarded the best illustration of Greeley's
matchless prose.</p>

<p>&quot;The election is over,&quot; he says, &quot;and its results sufficiently
ascertained. It seems to me a fitting time to announce to you the
dissolution of the political firm of Seward, Weed &amp; Greeley, by the
withdrawal of the junior partner&#8212;said withdrawal to take effect on
the morning after the first Tuesday in February next. And, as it may
seem a great presumption in me to assume that any such firm exists,
especially since the public was advised, rather more than a year ago,
by an editorial rescript in the <i>Evening Journal</i>, formally reading me
out of the Whig party, that I was esteemed no longer either useful or
ornamental in the concern, you will, I am sure, indulge me in some
reminiscences which seem to befit the occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.312" id="Page_ii.312">ii. 312</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;I was a poor young printer and editor of a literary journal&#8212;a very
active and bitter Whig in a small way, but not seeking to be known out
of my own ward committee&#8212;when, after the great political revulsion of
1837, I was one day called to the City Hotel, where two strangers
introduced themselves as Thurlow Weed and Lewis Benedict, of Albany.
They told me that a cheap campaign paper of a peculiar stamp at Albany
had been resolved on, and that I had been selected to edit it. The
announcement might well be deemed flattering by one who had never even
sought the notice of the great, and who was not known as a partisan
writer, and I eagerly embraced their proposals. They asked me to fix
my salary for the year; I named $1,000, which they agreed to; and I
did the work required to the best of my ability. It was work that made
no figure and created no sensation; but I loved it and did it well.
When it was done you were Governor, dispensing offices worth $3000 to
$20,000 per year to your friends and compatriots, and I returned to my
garret and my crust, and my desperate battle with pecuniary
obligations heaped upon me by bad partners in business and the
disastrous events of 1837. I believe it did not then occur to me that
some of these abundant places might have been offered to me without
injustice; I now think it should have occurred to you. If it did occur
to me, I was not the man to ask you for it; I think that should not
have been necessary. I only remember that no friend at Albany inquired
as to my pecuniary circumstances; that your friend (but not mine),
Robert C. Wetmore, was one of the chief dispensers of your patronage
here; and that such devoted compatriots as A.H. Wells and John Hooks
were lifted by you out of pauperism into independence, as I am glad I
was not; and yet an inquiry from you as to my needs and means at that
time would have been timely, and held ever in grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>&quot;In the Harrison campaign of 1840 I was again designated to edit a
campaign paper. I published it as well, and ought to have made
something by it, in spite of its extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.313" id="Page_ii.313">ii. 313</a></span> low price; my extreme
poverty was the main reason why I did not. It compelled me to hire
presswork, mailing, etc., done by the job, and high charges for extra
work nearly ate me up. At the close I was still without property and
in debt, but this paper had rather improved my position.</p>

<p>&quot;Now came the great scramble of the swell mob of coon minstrels and
cider suckers at Washington&#8212;I not being counted in. Several regiments
of them went on from this city; but no one of the whole crowd&#8212;though
I say it who should not&#8212;had done so much toward General Harrison's
nomination and election as yours respectfully. I asked nothing,
expected nothing; <i>but you</i>, Governor Seward, <i>ought to have asked
that I be postmaster of New York</i>. Your asking would have been in
vain; but it would have been an act of grace neither wasted nor
undeserved.</p>

<p>&quot;I soon after started the <i>Tribune</i>, because I was urged to do so by
certain of your friends, and because such a paper was needed here. I
was promised certain pecuniary aid in so doing; it might have been
given me without cost or risk to any one. All I ever had was a loan by
piecemeal of $1000, from James Coggeshall. God bless his honoured
memory! I did not ask for this, and I think it is the one sole case in
which I ever received a pecuniary favour from a political associate. I
am very thankful that he did not die till it was fully repaid.</p>

<p>&quot;And let me here honour one grateful recollection. When the Whig party
under your rule had offices to give, my name was never thought of; but
when in '42-'43, we were hopelessly out of power, I was honoured with
the nomination for state printer. When we came again to have a state
printer to elect, as well as nominate, the place went to Weed, as it
ought. Yet it was worth something to know that there was once a time
when it was not deemed too great a sacrifice to recognise me as
belonging to your household. If a new office had not since been
created on purpose to give its valuable patronage to H.J. Raymond and
enable St. John to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.314" id="Page_ii.314">ii. 314</a></span> forth his <i>Times</i> as the organ of the Whig
state administration, I should have been still more grateful.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1848 your star again rose, and my warmest hopes were realised in
your election to the Senate. I was no longer needy, and had no more
claim than desire to be recognised by General Taylor. I think I had
some claim to forbearance from you. What I received thereupon was a
most humiliating lecture in the shape of a decision in the libel case
of Redfield and Pringle, and an obligation to publish it in my own and
the other journal of our supposed firm. I thought and still think this
lecture needlessly cruel and mortifying. The plaintiffs, after using
my columns to the extent of their needs or desires, stopped writing
and called on me for the name of their assailant. I proffered it to
them&#8212;a thoroughly responsible man. They refused to accept it unless
it should prove to be one of the four or five first men in
Batavia!&#8212;when they had known from the first who it was, and that it
was neither of them. They would not accept that which they had
demanded; they sued me instead for money, and money you were at
liberty to give them to their heart's content. I do not think you
<i>were</i> at liberty to humiliate me in the eyes of my own and your
public as you did. I think you exalted your own judicial sternness and
fearlessness unduly at my expense. I think you had a better occasion
for the display of these qualities when Webb threw himself entirely
upon you for a pardon which he had done all a man could do to demerit.
His paper is paying you for it now.</p>

<p>&quot;I have publicly set forth my view of your and our duty with respect
to fusion, Nebraska, and party designations. I will not repeat any of
that. I have referred also to Weed's reading me out of the Whig
party&#8212;my crime being, in this as in some other things, that of doing
to-day what more politic persons will not be ready to do till
to-morrow.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me speak of the late canvass. I was once sent to Congress for
ninety days merely to enable Jim Brooks to secure a seat therein for
four years. <i>I think I never hinted to any human being that I would
have liked to be put forward for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.315" id="Page_ii.315">ii. 315</a></span> any place.</i> But James W. White (you
hardly know how good and true a man he is) started my name for
Congress, and Brooks' packed delegation thought I could help him
through; so I was put on behind him. But this last spring, after the
Nebraska question had created a new state of things at the North, one
or two personal friends, of no political consideration, suggested my
name as a candidate for governor, and I did not discourage them. Soon,
the persons who were afterward mainly instrumental in nominating Clark
came about me, and asked if I could secure the Know-Nothing vote. I
told them I neither could nor would touch it; on the contrary, I
loathed and repelled it. Thereupon they turned upon Clark.</p>

<p>&quot;I said nothing, did nothing. A hundred people asked me who should be
run for governor. I sometimes indicated Patterson; I never hinted at
my own name. But by and by Weed came down, and called me to him, to
tell me why he could not support me for governor. I had never asked
nor counted on his support.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure Weed did not mean to humiliate me; but he did it. The
upshot of his discourse (very cautiously stated) was this: If I were a
candidate for governor, I should beat not myself only, but you.
Perhaps that was true. But as I had in no manner solicited his or your
support, I thought this might have been said to my friends rather than
to me. I suspect it is true that I could not have been elected
governor as a Whig. But had he and you been favourable, there would
have been a party in the State ere this which could and would have
elected me to <i>any</i> post, without injuring itself or endangering your
re-election.</p>

<p>&quot;It was in vain that I urged that I had in no manner asked a
nomination. At length I was nettled by his language&#8212;well intended,
but <i>very</i> cutting as addressed by him to me&#8212;to say, in substance,
'Well, then, make Patterson governor, and try my name for lieutenant.
To lose this place is a matter of no importance; and we can see
whether I am really so odious.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.316" id="Page_ii.316">ii. 316</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;I should have hated to serve as lieutenant-governor, but I should
have gloried in running for the post. I want to have my enemies all
upon me at once; am tired of fighting them piecemeal. And, though I
should have been beaten in the canvass, I know that my running would
have helped the ticket, and helped my paper.</p>

<p>&quot;It was thought best to let the matter take another course. No other
name could have been put on the ticket so bitterly humbling to me as
that which was selected. The nomination was given to Raymond; the
fight left to me. And, Governor Seward, <i>I have made it</i>, though it be
conceited in me to say so. Even Weed has not been (I speak of his
paper) hearty in this contest, while the journal of the Whig
lieutenant-governor has taken care of its own interests and let the
canvass take care of itself, as it early declared it would do. That
journal has (because of its milk-and-water course) some twenty
thousand subscribers in this city and its suburbs, and of these twenty
thousand, I venture to say more voted for Ullman and Scroggs than for
Clark and Raymond; the <i>Tribune</i> (also because of its character) has
but eight thousand subscribers within the same radius, and I venture
to say that of its habitual readers, nine-tenths voted for Clark and
Raymond&#8212;very few for Ullman and Scroggs. I had to bear the brunt of
the contest....</p>

<p>&quot;Governor Seward, I know that some of your most cherished friends
think me a great obstacle to your advancement; that John Schoolcraft,
for one, insists that you and Weed should not be identified with me. I
trust, after a time, you will not be. I trust I shall never be found
in opposition to you; I have no further wish than to glide out of the
newspaper world as quietly and as speedily as possible, join my family
in Europe, and, if possible, stay there quite a time&#8212;long enough to
cool my fevered brain and renovate my over-tasked energies. All I ask
is that we shall be counted even on the morning after the first
Tuesday in February, as aforesaid, and that I may thereafter take such
course as seems best without reference to the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.317" id="Page_ii.317">ii. 317</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;You have done me acts of valued kindness in the line of your
profession; let me close with the assurance that these will ever be
gratefully remembered by Yours, Horace Greeley.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>At the time Seward received this letter he regarded it as only a
passing cloud-shadow. &quot;To-day I have a long letter from Greeley, full
of sharp, pricking thorns,&quot; he wrote Weed. &quot;I judge, as we might
indeed well know from his nobleness of disposition, that he has no
idea of saying or doing anything wrong or unkind; but it is sad to see
him so unhappy. Will there be a vacancy in the Board of Regents this
winter? Could one be made at the close of the session? Could he have
it? Raymond's nomination and election is hard for him to bear.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
Two or three weeks later, after a call at the <i>Tribune</i> office, Seward
again wrote Weed, suggesting that &quot;Greeley's despondency is
overwhelming, and seems to be aggravated by the loss of subscribers.
But below this is chagrin at the failure to obtain official
position.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> With such inquiries and comments Seward put the famous
letter away.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Its publication did not accomplish all that Raymond expected. People
were amazed, and deep in their hearts many persons felt that Greeley
had been treated unfairly. The inquiry as to a vacancy in the Board of
Regents showed that Seward himself shared this opinion at the time.
But the question that most interested the public in 1860 was, why, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.318" id="Page_ii.318">ii. 318</a></span>
Greeley had declared war upon Seward in 1854, did not Weed make it
known in time to destroy the influence of the man who had
&quot;deliberately wreaked the long-hoarded revenge of a disappointed
office-seeker?&quot; This question reflected upon Weed's management of
Seward's campaign, and to avoid the criticism he claimed to have been
&quot;in blissful ignorance of its contents.&quot; This seems almost impossible.
But in explaining the groundlessness of Greeley's complaints, Weed
wrote an editorial, the dignity and patriotism of which contrasted
favourably with Greeley's self-seeking.</p>

<p>&quot;There are some things in this letter,&quot; wrote the editor of the
<i>Evening Journal</i>, &quot;requiring explanation&#8212;all things in it, indeed,
are susceptible of explanations consistent with Governor Seward's full
appreciation of Mr. Greeley's friendship and services. The letter was
evidently written under a morbid state of feeling, and it is less a
matter of surprise that such a letter was thus written, than that its
writer should not only cherish the ill-will that prompted it for six
years, but allow it to influence his action upon a question which
concerns his party and his country.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Greeley's first complaint is that this journal, in an 'editorial
rescript formally read him out of the Whig party.' Now, here is the
'editorial rescript formally reading' Mr. Greeley out of the Whig
party, taken from the <i>Evening Journal</i> of September 6, 1853:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;'The <i>Tribune</i> defines its position in reference to the
approaching election. Regarding the &quot;Maine law&quot; as a
question of paramount importance, it will support members of
the legislature friendly to its passage, irrespective of
party. For state officers it will support such men as it
deems competent and trustworthy, irrespective also of party,
and without regard to the &quot;Maine law.&quot; In a word, it avows
itself, for the present, if not forever, an independent
journal (it was pretty much so always), discarding party
usages, mandates, and platforms.</p>

<p>&quot;'We regret to lose, in the <i>Tribune</i>, an old, able, and
effi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.319" id="Page_ii.319">ii. 319</a></span>cient co-labourer in the Whig vineyard. But when
carried away by its convictions of duty to other, and, in
its judgment, higher and more beneficent objects, we have as
little right as inclination to complain. The <i>Tribune</i> takes
with it, wherever it goes, an indomitable and powerful pen,
a devoted, a noble, and an unselfish zeal. Its senior editor
evidently supposes himself permanently divorced from the
Whig party, but we shall be disappointed if, after a year or
two's sturdy pulling at the oar of reform, he does not
return to his long-cherished belief that great and
beneficent aims must continue, as they commenced, to be
wrought out through Whig instrumentalities.</p>

<p>&quot;'But we only intended to say that the <i>Tribune</i> openly and
frankly avows its intention and policy; and that in things
about which we cannot agree, we can and will disagree as
friends.'</p></div>

<p>&quot;Pray read this article again, if its purpose and import be not
clearly understood! At the time it appeared, the <i>Tribune</i> was under
high pressure 'Maine law' speed. That question, in Mr. Greeley's view,
was paramount to all others. It was the <i>Tribune's</i> 'higher law.' Mr.
Greeley had given warning in his paper that he should support 'Maine
law' candidates for the legislature, and for state offices, regardless
of their political or party principles and character. And this, too,
when senators to be elected had to choose a senator in Congress. But
instead of 'reading' Mr. Greeley 'out of the Whig party,' it will be
seen that after Mr. Greeley had read himself out of the party by
discarding 'party usages, mandates, and platforms,' the <i>Evening
Journal</i>, in the language and spirit of friendship, predicted just
what happened, namely, that, in due time, Mr. Greeley would 'return to
his long-cherished belief that great and beneficent aims must
continue, as they commenced, to be wrought out through Whig
instrumentalities.'</p>

<p>&quot;We submit, even to Mr. Greeley himself, whether there is one word or
thought in the article to which he referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.320" id="Page_ii.320">ii. 320</a></span> justifying his accusation
that he had been 'read out of the Whig party' by the <i>Evening
Journal</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;In December, 1837, when we sought the acquaintance and co-operation
of Mr. Greeley, we were, like him, a 'poor printer,' working as hard
as he worked. We had then been sole editor, reporter, news collector,
'remarkable accident,' 'horrid murder,' 'items' man, etc., etc., for
seven years, at a salary of $750, $1000, $1250, and $1500. We had also
been working hard, for poor pay, as an editor and politician, for the
twelve years preceding 1830. We stood, therefore, on the same footing
with Mr. Greeley when the partnership was formed. We knew that Mr.
Greeley was much abler, more indomitably industrious, and, as we
believed, a better man in all respects. We foresaw for him a brilliant
future; and, if we had not started with utterly erroneous views of his
objects, we do not believe that our relations would have jarred. We
believed him indifferent alike to the temptations of money and office,
desiring only to become both 'useful' and 'ornamental,' as the editor
of a patriotic, enlightened, leading, and influential public journal.
For years, therefore, we placed Horace Greeley far above the 'swell
mob' of office-seekers, for whom, in his letter, he expresses so much
contempt. Had Governor Seward known, in 1838, that Mr. Greeley coveted
an inspectorship, he certainly would have received it. Indeed, if our
memory be not at fault, Mr. Greeley was offered the clerkship of the
Assembly in 1838. It was certainly pressed upon us, and, though at
that time, like Mr. Greeley, desperately poor, it was declined.</p>

<p>&quot;We cannot think that Mr. Greeley's political friends, after the
<i>Tribune</i> was under way, knew that he needed the 'pecuniary aid' which
had been promised. When, about that period, we suggested to him (after
consulting some of the board) that the printing of the common council,
might be obtained, he refused to have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>&quot;In relation to the state printing, Mr. Greeley knows that there never
was a day when, if he had chosen to come to Albany, he might not have
taken whatever interest he pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.321" id="Page_ii.321">ii. 321</a></span> in the <i>Journal</i> and its state
printing. But he wisely regarded his position in New York, and the
future of the <i>Tribune</i>, as far more desirable.</p>

<p>&quot;For the 'creation of the new office for the <i>Times</i>,' Mr. Greeley
knows perfectly well that Governor Seward was in no manner
responsible.</p>

<p>&quot;That Mr. Greeley should make the adjustment of the libel suit of
Messrs. Redfield and Pringle against the <i>Tribune</i> a ground of
accusation against Governor Seward is a matter of astonishment.
Governor Seward undertook the settlement of that suit as the friend of
Mr. Greeley, at a time when a systematic effort was being made to
destroy both the <i>Tribune</i> and <i>Journal</i> by prosecutions for libel. We
were literally plastered over with writs, declarations, etc. There
were at least two judges of the Supreme Court in the State, on whom
plaintiffs were at liberty to count for verdicts. Governor Seward
tendered his professional services to Mr. Greeley, and in the case
referred to, as in others, foiled the adversary. For such service this
seems a strange requital. Less fortunate than the <i>Tribune</i>, it cost
the <i>Journal</i> over $8000 to reach a point in legal proceedings that
enabled a defendant in a libel suit to give the truth in evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;It was by no fault or neglect or wish of Governor Seward that Mr.
Greeley served but 'ninety days in Congress.' Nor will we say what
others have said, that his congressional <i>d&#233;but</i> was a failure. There
were no other reasons, and this seems a fitting occasion to state
them. Mr. Greeley's 'isms' were in his way at conventions. The sharp
points and rough edges of the <i>Tribune</i> rendered him unacceptable to
those who nominate candidates. This was more so formerly than at
present, for most of the rampant reforms to which the <i>Tribune</i> was
devoted have subsided. We had no sympathy with, and little respect
for, a constituency that preferred 'Jim' Brooks to Horace Greeley.</p>

<p>&quot;Nearly forty years of experience leaves us in some doubt whether,
with political friends, an open, frank, and truthful, or a cautious,
calculating, non-committal course is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.322" id="Page_ii.322">ii. 322</a></span> right, but the easiest
and most politic. The former, which we have chosen, has made us much
trouble and many enemies. Few candidates are able to bear the truth,
or to believe that the friend who utters it is truly one.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1854, the <i>Tribune</i>, through years of earnest effort, had educated
the people up to the point of demanding a 'Maine law' candidate for
governor. But its followers would not accept their chief reformer! It
was evident that the state convention was to be largely influenced by
'Maine law' and 'Choctaw' Know-Nothing delegates. It was equally
evident that Mr. Greeley could neither be nominated nor elected. Hence
the conference to which he refers. We found, as on two other occasions
during thirty years, our state convention impracticable. We submitted
the names of Lieutenant-Governor Patterson and Judge Harris (both
temperance men in faith and practice) as candidates for governor,
coupled with that of Mr. Greeley for lieutenant-governor. But the
'Maine law' men would have none of these, preferring Myron H. Clark
(who used up the raw material of temperance), qualified by H.J.
Raymond for lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>&quot;What Mr. Greeley says of the relative zeal and efficiency of the
<i>Tribune</i> and <i>Times</i>, and of our own feelings in that contest, is
true. We did our duty, but with less of enthusiasm than when we were
supporting either Granger, Seward, Bradish, Hunt, Fish, King, or
Morgan for governor.</p>

<p>&quot;One word in relation to the supposed 'political firm.' Mr. Greeley
brought into it his full quota of capital. But were there no
beneficial results, no accruing advantages, to himself? Did he not
attain, in the sixteen years, a high position, world-wide reputation,
and an ample fortune? Admit, as we do, that he is not as wealthy as we
wish he was, it is not because the <i>Tribune</i> has not made his fortune,
but because he did not keep it&#8212;because it went, as other people's
money goes, to friends, to pay indorsements, and in bad investments.</p>

<p>&quot;We had both been liberally, nay, generously, sustained by our party.
Mr. Greeley differs with us in regarding pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.323" id="Page_ii.323">ii. 323</a></span>rons of newspapers as
conferring favours. In giving them the worth of their money, he holds
that the account is balanced. We, on the other hand, have ever held
the relation of newspaper editor and subscriber as one of fraternity.
Viewed in this aspect, the editors of the <i>Tribune</i> and <i>Evening
Journal</i> have manifold reasons for cherishing grateful recollections
of the liberal and abiding confidence and patronage of their party and
friends.</p>

<p>&quot;In conclusion, we cannot withhold an expression of sincere regret
that this letter has been called out. After remaining six years in
'blissful ignorance' of its contents, we should have preferred to have
ever remained so. It jars harshly upon cherished memories. It destroys
ideals of disinterestedness and generosity which relieved political
life from so much that is selfish, sordid, and rapacious.&quot;</p>

<p>Henry B. Stanton once asked Seward, directly, if he did not think it
would have been better to let Greeley have office. &quot;Mr. Seward looked
at me intently, rolled out a cloud of tobacco smoke, and then slowly
responded: 'I don't know but it would.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> It is doubtful, however,
if Seward ever forgave a New Yorker who contributed to his defeat.
Lincoln spoke of him as &quot;without gall,&quot; but Stanton declared him a
good hater who lay in wait to punish his foes. Greeley, James S.
Wadsworth, William Cullen Bryant, and David Dudley Field,
conspicuously led the opposition, and if he failed to annihilate them
all it is because some of them did not give him a chance to strike
back. Greeley caught the first knockout blow in February, 1861; and in
1862, says Stanton, &quot;he doubtless defeated James S. Wadsworth for
governor of New York. Wadsworth, who was then military commander of
Washington, told me that Seward was 'dead against him' all through the
campaign.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

THE FIGHT OF THE FUSIONISTS<br />
<br />
1860</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">After</span> the return of the Softs from Baltimore the condition of the
Democratic party became a subject of much anxiety. Dean Richmond's
persistent use of the unit rule had driven the Hards into open
rebellion, and at a great mass-meeting, held at Cooper Institute and
addressed by Daniel S. Dickinson, it was agreed to hold a Breckenridge
and Lane state convention at Syracuse on August 8. At the appointed
time three hundred delegates appeared, representing every county, but
with the notable exception of the chairman, Henry S. Randall, the
biographer of Thomas Jefferson, who had advocated the Wilmot Proviso
in 1847, written the Buffalo platform in 1848, and opposed the
fugitive slave law in 1850, practically all of them had steadily
opposed the Free-soil influences of their party. To many it seemed
strange, if not absolutely ludicrous, to hoist a pro-slavery flag in
the Empire State. But Republicans welcomed the division of their
opponents, and the Hards were terribly in earnest. They organised with
due formality; spent two days in conference; adopted the pro-slavery
platform of the seceders' convention amidst loud cheering; selected
candidates for a state and electoral ticket with the care that
precedes certain election; angrily denounced the leadership of Dean
Richmond at Charleston and Baltimore; appointed a new state committee,
and, with the usual assurance of determined men, claimed a large
following.</p>

<p>The indomitable Dickinson, in a speech not unlike his Cooper Institute
address, declared that Breckenridge, the regularly nominated candidate
of seventeen States and por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.325" id="Page_ii.325">ii. 325</a></span>tions of other States, would secure one
hundred and twenty-seven electoral votes in the South and on the
Pacific coast. This made the election, he argued, depend upon New
York, and since Douglas would start without the hope of getting a
single vote, it became the duty of every national Democrat to insist
that the Illinoisan be withdrawn. People might scoff at this movement
as &quot;a cloud no bigger than a man's hand,&quot; he said, but it would grow
in size and send forth a deluge that would refresh and purify the arid
soil of politics. The applause that greeted this prophecy indicated
faith in a principle that most people knew had outlived its day in the
State; and, although Dickinson was always altogether on one side, it
is scarcely credible that he could sincerely believe that New York
would support Breckenridge, even if Douglas withdrew.</p>

<p>The Hards conjured with a few distinguished names which still gave
them prestige. Charles O'Conor, Greene C. Bronson, and John A. Dix, as
conservative, moderate leaders, undoubtedly had the confidence of many
people, and their ticket, headed by James T. Brady, the brilliant
lawyer, looked formidable. Personally, Brady was perhaps the most
popular man in New York City; and had he stood upon other than a
pro-slavery platform his support must have been generous. But the fact
that he advocated the protection of slave property in the territories,
although opposed to Buchanan's Lecompton policy, was destined to
subject him to humiliating defeat.</p>

<p>The Softs met in convention on August 15. In numbers and noisy
enthusiasm they did not seem to represent a larger following than the
Hards, but their principles expressed the real sentiment of whatever
was left of the rank and file of the Democratic party of the State.
Horatio Seymour was the pivotal personage. Around him they rallied.
The resolution indorsing Stephen A. Douglas and his doctrine of
non-intervention very adroitly avoided quarrels. It accepted Fernando
Wood's delegation on equal terms with Tammany; refused to notice the
Hards' attack upon Dean Richmond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.326" id="Page_ii.326">ii. 326</a></span> the majority of the Charleston
delegation; and nominated William Kelley of Hudson for governor by
acclamation. Kelley was a large farmer of respectable character and
talents, who had served with credit in the State Senate and supported
Van Buren in 1848 with the warmth of a sincere Free-soiler. He was
evidently a man without guile, and, although modest and plain-spoken,
he knew what the farmer and workingman most wanted, and addressed
himself to their best thought. It was generally conceded that he would
poll the full strength of his party.</p>

<p>But the cleverest act of the convention was its fusion with the
Constitutional Union party. In the preceding May, the old-line Whigs
and Know-Nothings had met at Baltimore and nominated John Bell of
Tennessee for President and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for Vice
President, on the simple platform: &quot;The Constitution of the country,
the union of the States, and the enforcement of the laws.&quot; Washington
Hunt, the former governor of New York, had become the convention's
president, and, in company with James Brooks and William Duer, he had
arranged with the Softs to place on the Douglas electoral ticket ten
representatives of the Union party, with William Kent, the popular son
of the distinguished Chancellor, at their head.</p>

<p>Hunt had become a thorn in the side of his old friends, now the
leading Republican managers. He had joined them as a Whig in the
thirties. After sending him to Congress for three terms and making him
comptroller of state in 1848, they had elected him governor in 1850;
but, in the division of the party, he joined the Silver-Grays, failed
of re-election in 1852, dropped into the American party in 1854, and
supported Fillmore in 1856. Thurlow Weed thought he ought to have
aided them in the formation of the Republican party, and Horace
Greeley occasionally reminded him that a decent regard for consistency
should impel him to act in accordance with his anti-slavery record;
but when, in 1860, Hunt began the crusade that successfully fused the
Douglas and Bell tickets in New York, thus seriously endangering the
election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.327" id="Page_ii.327">ii. 327</a></span> of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican editors opened their
batteries upon him with well-directed aim. In his one attempt to face
these attacks, Hunt taunted Greeley with being &quot;more dangerous to
friend than to foe.&quot; To this the editor of the <i>Tribune</i> retorted:
&quot;When I was your friend, you were six times before the people as a
candidate for most desirable offices, and in five of those six were
successful, while you were repeatedly a candidate before and have been
since, and always defeated. Possibly some have found me a dangerous
friend, but you never did.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Hunt's coalition movement, called the &quot;Syracuse juggle&quot; and the
&quot;confusion ticket,&quot; did not work as smoothly as he expected. It gave
rise to a bitter controversy which at once impaired its value. The
Bell negotiators declared that the ten electors, if chosen, would be
free to vote for their own candidate, while the Douglas mediators
stated with emphasis that each elector was not only pledged by the
resolution of the convention to support Douglas, but was required to
give his consent to do so or allow another to fill his place. &quot;We
cannot tell which answer is right,&quot; said the New York <i>Sun</i>, &quot;but it
looks as if there were deception practised.&quot; The <i>Tribune</i> presented
the ridiculous phase of it when it declared that the Bell electors
were put up to catch the Know-Nothings, while the others would trap
the Irish and Germans. &quot;Is this the way,&quot; it asked, referring to
William Kent and his associates, &quot;in which honourable men who have
characters to support, conduct political contests?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> To dissipate
the confusion, Hunt explained that the defeat of Lincoln would
probably throw the election into Congress, in which event Bell would
become President. &quot;But we declare, with the same frankness, that if
Douglas, and not Bell, shall become President, we will welcome that
result as greatly preferable to the success of sectional
candidates.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>The Republican state convention which met at Syracuse on August 22,
did not muffle its enthusiasm over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.328" id="Page_ii.328">ii. 328</a></span> schism in the Democratic
party. Seward and his friends had regained their composure. A
midsummer trip to New England, chiefly for recreation, had brought
great crowds about the Auburn statesmen wherever he appeared, and,
encouraged by their enthusiastic devotion, he returned satisfied with
the place he held in the hearts of Republicans. His followers, too,
indicated their disappointment by no public word or sign. To the end
of the convention its proceedings were marked by harmony and
unanimity. Edwin D. Morgan was renominated for governor by
acclamation; the platform of Chicago principles was adopted amidst
prolonged cheers, and the selection of electors approved without
dissent. The happy combination of the two electors-at-large, William
Cullen Bryant and James O. Putnam, evidenced the spirit of loyalty to
Abraham Lincoln that inspired all participants. Bryant had been an
oracle of the radical democracy for more than twenty years, and had
stubbornly opposed Seward; Putnam, a Whig of the school of Clay and
Webster, had, until recently, zealously supported Millard Fillmore and
the American party. In its eagerness to unite every phase of
anti-slavery sentiment the convention buried the past in its desire to
know, in the words of Seward, &quot;whether this is a constitutional
government under which we live.&quot;</p>

<p>During the campaign, Republican demonstrations glorified Lincoln's
early occupation of rail-splitting, while the Wide-awakes, composed
largely of young men who had studied the slavery question since 1852
solely as a moral issue, illuminated the night and aroused enthusiasm
with their torches and expert marching. As early as in September, the
New York <i>Herald</i> estimated that over four hundred thousand were
already uniformed and drilled. In every town and village these
organisations, unique then, although common enough nowadays, were
conscious appeals for sympathy and favour, and undoubtedly contributed
much to the result by enlisting the hearty support of first voters.
Indeed, on the Republican side, it was largely a campaign of young
men. &quot;The Republican party,&quot; said Seward at Cleveland, &quot;is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.329" id="Page_ii.329">ii. 329</a></span> party
chiefly of young men. Each successive year brings into its ranks an
increasing proportion of the young men of this country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Aside from the torch-light processions of the Wide-awakes, the almost
numberless speeches were the feature of the canvass of 1860. There
had, perhaps, been more exciting and enthusiastic campaigns, but the
number of meetings was without precedent. The <i>Tribune</i> estimated that
ten thousand set addresses were made in New York alone, and that the
number in the country equalled all that had been made in previous
presidential canvasses since 1789. It is likewise true that at no time
in the history of the State did so many distinguished men take part in
a campaign. Though the clergy were not so obtrusive as in 1856, Henry
Ward Beecher and Edwin H. Chapin, the eminent Universalist, did not
hesitate to deliver political sermons from their pulpits, closing
their campaign on the Sunday evening before election.</p>

<p>But the New Yorker whom the Republican masses most desired to hear and
see was William H. Seward. Accordingly, in the latter part of August
he started on a five weeks' tour through the Western States, beginning
at Detroit and closing at Cleveland. At every point where train or
steamboat stopped, if only for fifteen minutes, thousands of people
awaited his coming. The day he spoke in Chicago, it was estimated that
two hundred thousand visitors came to that city. Rhodes suggests that
&quot;it was then he reached the climax of his career.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Seward's speeches contained nothing new, and in substance they
resembled one another. But in freshness of thought and kaleidoscopic
phraseology, they were attractive, full of eloquence, and of
statesmanlike comment, lifting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.330" id="Page_ii.330">ii. 330</a></span> campaign, then just opening, upon
a high plane of political and moral patriotism. He avoided all
personalities; he indicated no disappointment;<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> his praise of
Lincoln was in excellent taste; and without evasion or concealment,
but with a ripeness of experience that had mellowed and enlightened
him, he talked of &quot;higher law&quot; and the &quot;irrepressible conflict&quot; in
terms that made men welcome rather than fear their discussion. &quot;Let
this battle be decided in favour of freedom in the territories,&quot; he
declared, &quot;and not one slave will ever be carried into the territories
of the United States, and that will end the irrepressible
conflict.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The growth and resources of the great Northwest, whose development he
attributed to the exclusion of slave labour, seemed to inspire him
with the hope and faith of youth, and he spoke of its reservation for
freedom and its settlement and upbuilding in the critical moment of
the country's history as providential, since it must rally the free
States of the Atlantic coast to call back the ancient principles which
had been abandoned by the government to slavery. &quot;We resign to you,&quot;
he said, &quot;the banner of human rights and human liberty on this
continent, and we bid you be firm, bold, and onward, and then you may
hope that we will be able to follow you.&quot; It was in one of these
moments of exaltation when he seemed to be lifted into the higher
domain of prophecy that he made the prediction afterward realised by
the Alaska treaty. &quot;Standing here and looking far off into the
Northwest,&quot; he said, &quot;I see the Russian as he busily occupies himself
in establishing seaports and towns and fortifications on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.331" id="Page_ii.331">ii. 331</a></span> the verge of
this continent as the outposts of St. Petersburg, and I can say, 'Go
on, and build up your outposts all along the coast, up even to the
Arctic Ocean, for they will yet become the outposts of my own
country&#8212;monuments of the civilisation of the United States in the
Northwest.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the canvass, Republican confidence and enthusiasm
contrasted strangely with the apathy of the Democratic party, caused
by its two tickets, two organisations, and two incompatible platforms.
It was recognised early in the campaign that Douglas could carry no
slave State unless it be Missouri; and, although the Douglas and Bell
fusion awaked some hope, it was not until the fusion electoral ticket
included supporters of Breckenridge that the struggle became vehement
and energetic. New York's thirty-five votes were essential to the
election of Lincoln, and early in September a determined effort began
to unite the three parties against him. The Hards resisted the
movement, but many merchants and capitalists of New York City,
apprehensive of the dissolution of the Union if Lincoln were elected,
and promising large sums of money to the campaign, forced the
substitution of seven Breckenridge electors in place of as many
Douglas supporters, giving Bell ten, Breckenridge seven, and Douglas
eighteen. &quot;It is understood,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;that four nabobs
have already subscribed twenty-five thousand dollars each, and that
one million is to be raised.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>All this disturbed Lincoln. &quot;I think there will be the most
extraordinary effort ever made to carry New York for Douglas,&quot; he
wrote Weed on August 17. &quot;You and all others who write me from your
State think the effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right.
Still, it will require close watching and great efforts on the other
side.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> After fusion did succeed, the Republican managers found
encouragement in the fact that a majority of the Americans in the
western part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.332" id="Page_ii.332">ii. 332</a></span> of the State,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> following the lead of Putnam,
belonged to the party of Lincoln, while the Germans gave comforting
evidence of their support. On his return from the West Seward assured
Lincoln &quot;that this State will redeem all the pledges we have
made.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Then came the October verdict from Pennsylvania and
Indiana. &quot;Emancipation or revolution is now upon us,&quot; said the
Charleston <i>Mercury</i>.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Yet the hope of the New York fusionists,
encouraged by a stock panic in Wall Street and by the unconcealed
statement of Howell Cobb of Georgia, then secretary of the treasury,
that Lincoln's election would be followed by disunion and a serious
derangement of the financial interests of the country, kept the Empire
State violently excited. It was reported in Southern newspapers that
William B. Astor had contributed one million of dollars in aid of the
fusion ticket.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> It was a formidable combination of elements.
Heretofore the Republican party had defeated them separately&#8212;now it
met them as a united whole, when antagonisms, ceasing to be those of
rational debate, had become those of fierce and furious passion.
Greeley pronounced it &quot;a struggle as intense, as vehement, and as
energetic, as had ever been known,&quot; in New York.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Yet Thurlow
Weed's confidence never wavered. &quot;The fusion leaders have largely
increased their fund,&quot; he wrote Lincoln, three days before the
election, &quot;and they are now using money lavishly. This stimulates and
to some extent inspires confidence, and all the confederates are at
work. Some of our friends are nervous. But I have no fear of the
result in this State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>After the election, returns came in rapidly. Before mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.333" id="Page_ii.333">ii. 333</a></span>night they
foreshadowed Lincoln's success, and the next morning's <i>Tribune</i>
estimated that the Republicans had carried the electoral and state
tickets by 30,000 to 50,000, with both branches of the Legislature and
twenty-three out of thirty-three congressmen. The official figures did
not change this prophecy, except to fix Lincoln's majority at 50,136
and Morgan's plurality at 63,460. Lincoln received 4374 votes more
than Morgan, but Kelley ran 27,698 behind the fusion electoral ticket,
showing that the Bell and Everett men declined to vote for the Softs'
candidate for governor. Brady's total vote, 19,841, marked the
pro-slavery candidate's small support, leaving Morgan a clear majority
of 43,619.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> &quot;Mr. Dickinson and myself,&quot; said James T. Brady, six
years later, in his tribute to the former's memory, &quot;belonged to the
small, despairing band in this State who carried into the political
contest of the North, for the last time, the flag of the South,
contending that the South should enjoy to the utmost, and with liberal
recognition, all the rights she could fairly claim under the
Constitution of the United States. How small that band was all
familiar with the political history of this State can tell.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

GREELEY, WEED, AND SECESSION<br />
<br />
1860-1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the election of Lincoln in November, 1860, South Carolina almost
immediately gave evidence of its purpose to secede from the Union.
Democrats generally, and many supporters of Bell and Everett, had
deemed secession probable in the event of Republican success&#8212;a belief
so fully shared by the authorities at Washington, who understood the
Southern people, that General Scott, then at the head of the army,
wrote to President Buchanan before the end of October, advising that
forts in all important Southern seaports be strengthened to avoid
capture by surprise. On the other hand, the Republicans had regarded
Southern threats as largely buncombe. They had been heard in 1820, in
1850, and so frequently in debate leading up to the contest in 1860,
that William H. Seward, the most powerful leader of opinion in his
party, had declared: &quot;These hasty threats of disunion are so unnatural
that they will find no hand to execute them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, when, on November 16, the South Carolina Legislature
passed an act calling a convention to meet on December 17, the
Republicans, still enthusiastic over their success, began seriously to
consider the question of disunion. &quot;Do you think the South will
secede?&quot; became as common a salutation as &quot;Good-morning;&quot; and,
although a few New Yorkers, perhaps, gave the indifferent reply of
Henry Ward Beecher&#8212;&quot;I don't believe they will; and I don't care if
they do&quot;<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>&#8212;the gloom and uncertainty which hung over business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.335" id="Page_ii.335">ii. 335</a></span>
circles made all anxious to hear from the leaders of their party.
Heretofore, Horace Greeley, Thurlow Weed, and William H. Seward,
backed by Henry J. Raymond of the New York <i>Times</i> and James Watson
Webb of the <i>Courier</i>, had been quick to meet any emergency, and their
followers now looked to them for direction.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley was admittedly the most influential Republican
journalist. He had not always agreed with the leaders, and just now an
open break existed in the relations of himself and the powerful
triumvirate headed by Thurlow Weed; but Greeley had voiced the
sentiment of the rank and file of his party more often than he had
misstated it, and the <i>Tribune</i> readers naturally turned to their
prophet for a solution of the pending trouble. As usual, he had an
opinion. The election occurred on November 6, and on the 9th he
declared that &quot;if the cotton States shall decide that they can do
better out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in
peace. The right to secede may be a revolutionary one, but it exists
nevertheless.... Whenever a considerable section of our Union shall
deliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures
designed to keep it in. We hope never to live in a republic, whereof
one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Two weeks
later, on November 26, he practically repeated these views. &quot;If the
cotton States unitedly and earnestly wish to withdraw peacefully from
the Union, we think they should and would be allowed to go. Any
attempt to compel them by force to remain would be contrary to the
principles enunciated in the immortal Declaration of Independence,
contrary to the fundamental ideas on which human liberty is
based.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> As late as December 17, when South Carolina and other
Southern States were on the threshold of secession, Greeley declared
that &quot;if the Declaration of Independence justified the secession from
the British Empire of three millions of colonists in 1776, we do not
see why it should not justify the secession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.336" id="Page_ii.336">ii. 336</a></span> five millions of
Southrons from the Union in 1861.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In January, he recanted in a
measure. Yet, on February 23, he announced that &quot;Whenever it shall be
clear that the great body of the Southern people have become
conclusively alienated from the Union, and anxious to escape from it,
we will do our best to forward their views.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and the Garrison Abolitionists<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> also
inclined to this view; and, in November and December, a few
Republicans, because of a general repugnance to the coercion of a
State, did not despise it. Naturally, however, the Greeley policy did
not please the great bulk of Lincoln's intelligent supporters. The
belief obtained that, the election having been fair and
constitutional, the South ought to submit to the decision as readily
as Northern Democrats acquiesced in it. Besides, a spontaneous feeling
existed that the United States was a nation, that secession was
treason, and seceders were traitors. Such people sighed for &quot;an hour
of Andrew Jackson;&quot; and, to supply the popular demand, Jackson's
proclamation against the nullifiers, written by Edward Livingston, a
native of New York, then secretary of state, was published in a cheap
and convenient edition. To the readers of such literature Greeley's
peaceable secession seemed like the erratic policy of an eccentric
thinker, and its promulgation, especially when it began giving comfort
and encouragement to the South, contributed not a little to the defeat
of its author for the United States Senate in the following February.</p>

<p>Thurlow Weed also had a plan, which quickly attracted the attention of
people in the South as well as in the North. He held that suggestions
of compromise which the South could accept might be proposed without
dishonour to the victors in the last election, and, in several
carefully written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.337" id="Page_ii.337">ii. 337</a></span> editorials in the <i>Evening Journal</i>, he argued in
favour of restoring the old line of the Missouri Compromise, and of
substituting for the fugitive slave act, payment for rescued slaves by
the counties in which the violation of law occurred. &quot;When we refer,
as we often do, triumphantly to the example of England,&quot; he said, &quot;we
are prone to forget that emancipation and compensation were provisions
of the same act of Parliament.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Weed was now sixty-three years of age&#8212;not an old man, and of little
less energy than in 1824, when he drove about the State in his first
encounter with Martin Van Buren. The success of the views he had
fearlessly maintained, in defiance of menacing opponents, had been
achieved in full measure, and he had reason to be proud of his
conspicuous part in the result; but now, in the presence of secession
which threatened the country because of that success, he seemed
suddenly to revolt against the policy he himself had fostered. As his
biographer expressed it, &quot;he cast aside the weapons which none could
wield so well,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and, betraying the influences of his early
training under the great Whig leaders, began to show his love for the
Union after the manner of Clay and Webster.</p>

<p>Weed outlined his policy with rare skill, hoping that the discussion
provoked by it might result in working out some plan to avoid
disunion.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Raymond, in the <i>Times</i>, and Webb in the <i>Courier</i>,
gave it cordial support; the leading New York business men of all
parties expressed themselves favourable to conciliation and
compromise. &quot;I can assure you,&quot; wrote August Belmont to Governor
Sprague of Rhode Island, on December 13, &quot;that all the leaders of the
Republican party in our State and city, with a few exceptions of the
ultra radicals, are in favour of concessions, and that the popular
mind of the North is ripe for them.&quot; On December 19 he wrote again:
&quot;Last evening I was present at an informal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.338" id="Page_ii.338">ii. 338</a></span> meeting of about thirty
gentlemen, comprising our leading men, Republicans, Union men, and
Democrats, composed of such names as Astor, Aspinwall, Moses H.
Grinnell, Hamilton Fish, R.M. Blatchford, &amp;c. They were unanimous in
their voice for reconciliation, and that the first steps have to be
taken by the North.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>Belmont undoubtedly voiced the New York supporters of Douglas,
Breckenridge, and Bell, and many conservative Republicans,
representing the business interests of the great metropolis; but the
bulk of the Republicans did not like a plan that overthrew the
corner-stone of their party, which had won on its opposition to the
extension of slavery into free territory. To go back to the line of
36&#176; 30&#180;, permitting slavery to the south of it, meant the loss of all
that had been gained, and a renewal of old issues and hostilities in
the near future. Republican congressmen from the State, almost without
exception, yielded to this view, voicing the sentiment that it was
vain to temporise longer with compromises. With fluent invective,
James B. McKean of Saratoga assailed the South in a speech that
recalled the eloquence of John W. Taylor, his distinguished
predecessor, who, in 1820, led the forces of freedom against the
Missouri Compromise. &quot;The slave-holders,&quot; he said, &quot;have been fairly
defeated in a presidential election. They now demand that the victors
shall concede to the vanquished all that the latter have ever claimed,
and vastly more than they could secure when they themselves were
victors. They take their principles in one hand, and the sword in the
other, and reaching out the former they say to us, 'Take these for
your own, or we will strike.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.339" id="Page_ii.339">ii. 339</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Weed kept at work. In an elaborate article, he suggested
a &quot;Convention of the people consisting of delegates appointed by the
States, to which North and South might bring their respective griefs,
claims, and reforms to a common arbitrament, to meet, discuss, and
determine upon a future. It will be said that we have done nothing
wrong, and have nothing to offer. This is precisely why we should both
purpose and offer whatever may, by possibility, avert the evils of
civil war and prevent the destruction of our hitherto unexampled
blessings of Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Preston King, the junior United States senator from New York, clearly
voicing the sentiment of the majority of his party in Congress and out
of it, bitterly opposed such a policy. &quot;It cannot be done,&quot; he wrote
Weed, on December 7. &quot;You must abandon your position. It will prove
distasteful to the majority of those whom you have hitherto led. You
and Seward should be among the foremost to brandish the lance and
shout for joy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> To this the famous editor, giving a succinct view
of his policy, replied with his usual directness. &quot;I have not dreamed
of anything inconsistent with Republican duty. We owe our existence as
a party to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.340" id="Page_ii.340">ii. 340</a></span> repeal of the Missouri Compromise. But for the ever
blind spirit of slavery, Buchanan would have taken away our ammunition
and spiked our guns. The continued blindness of Democracy and the
continued madness of slavery enabled us to elect Lincoln. That success
ends our mission so far as Kansas and the encroachments of slavery
into free territory are concerned. We have no territory that invites
slavery for any other than political objects, and with the power of
territorial organisation in the hands of Lincoln, there is no
political temptation in all the territory belonging to us. The fight
is over. Practically, the issues of the late campaign are obsolete. If
the Republican members of Congress stand still, we shall have a
divided North and a united South. If they move promptly, there will be
a divided South and a united North.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, surprising that Weed found so much to say in
favour of his proposition, since the same compromise and the same
arguments were made use of a few weeks later by no less a person than
the venerable John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, the Nestor of the United
States Senate. Crittenden was ten years older than Weed, and, like
him, was actuated by sincere patriotism. Although his compromise
contained six proposed amendments to the Constitution, it was believed
that all differences between the sections could easily be adjusted
after the acceptance of the first article, which recognised slavery as
existing south of latitude 36&#176; 30&#180;, and pledged it protection &quot;as
property by all the departments of the territorial government during
its continuance.&quot; The article also provided that States should be
admitted from territory either north or south of that line, with or
without slavery, as their constitutions might declare.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> This part
of the compromise was not new to Congress or to the country. It had
been made, on behalf of the South, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.341" id="Page_ii.341">ii. 341</a></span> 1847, and defeated by a vote of
114 to 82, only four Northern Democrats sustaining it. It was again
defeated more decisively in 1848, when proposed by Douglas. &quot;Thus the
North,&quot; wrote Greeley, &quot;under the lead of the Republicans, was
required, in 1860, to make, on pain of civil war, concessions to
slavery which it had utterly refused when divided only between the
conservative parties of a few years before.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Crittenden proposition invoked the same influences
that supported the Weed plan. &quot;I would most cheerfully accept it,&quot;
wrote John A. Dix. &quot;I feel a strong confidence that we could carry
three-fourths of the States in favour of it as an amendment to the
Constitution.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> August Belmont said he had &quot;yet to meet the first
conservative Union-loving man, in or out of politics, who does not
approve of your compromise propositions.... In our own city and State
some of the most prominent men are ready to follow the lead of Weed.
Restoration of the Missouri line finds favour with most of the
conservative Republicans, and their number is increasing daily.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
Belmont, now more than earlier in the month, undoubtedly expressed a
ripening sentiment that was fostered by the gloomy state of trade,
creating feverish conditions in the stock market, forcing New York
banks to issue clearing-house certificates, and causing a marked
decline in the Republican vote at the municipal election in
Hudson.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Indeed, there is abundant evidence that the Crittenden
proposition, if promptly carried out in December, might have resulted
in peace. The Senate committee of thirteen to whom it was
referred&#8212;consisting of two senators from the cotton States, three
from the border States, three Northern Democrats, and five
Republicans&#8212;decided that no report should be adopted unless it had
the assent of a majority of the Republicans, and also a majority of
the eight other members. Six of the eight voted for it. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.342" id="Page_ii.342">ii. 342</a></span>
Republicans, and Jefferson Davis and Robert Toombs, representing the
cotton States, voted against it. The evidence however, is almost
convincing that Davis and Toombs would have supported it in December
if the Republicans had voted for it. In speeches in the open Senate,
Douglas declared it,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Toombs admitted it,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and Davis implied
it.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Seward sounds the only note of their insincerity. &quot;I think,&quot;
he said, in a letter to the President-elect, &quot;that Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana could not be arrested, even if we should
offer all you suggest, and with it the restoration of the Missouri
Compromise line. But persons acting for those States intimate that
they might be so arrested, because they think that the Republicans are
not going to concede the restoration of that line.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> It is likely
Seward hesitated to believe that his vote against the compromise, for
whatever reason it was given, helped to inaugurate hostilities; and
yet nothing is clearer, in spite of his letter to Lincoln, than that
in December the Republicans defeated the Crittenden compromise, the
adoption of which would have prevented civil war.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>In deference to the wishes of Lincoln and of his friends, who were
grooming him for United States senator, Greeley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.343" id="Page_ii.343">ii. 343</a></span> before the end of
December, had, in a measure, given up his damaging doctrine of
peaceable secession, and accepted the &quot;no compromise&quot; policy, laid
down by Benjamin F. Wade, as &quot;the only true, the only honest, the only
safe doctrine.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It was necessary to Greeley's position just then,
and to the stage of development which his candidacy had reached, that
he should oppose Weed's compromise. On the 22d of December, therefore,
he wrote the President-elect: &quot;I fear nothing, care for nothing, but
another disgraceful backdown of the free States. That is the only real
danger. Let the Union slide&#8212;it may be reconstructed; let Presidents
be assassinated&#8212;we can elect more; let the Republicans be defeated
and crushed&#8212;we shall rise again. But another nasty compromise,
whereby everything is conceded and nothing secured, will so thoroughly
disgrace and humiliate us that we can never raise our heads, and this
country becomes a second edition of the Barbary States, as they were
sixty years ago. 'Take any form but that.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> On the same day the
<i>Tribune</i> announced that &quot;Mr. Lincoln is utterly opposed to any
concession or compromise that shall yield one iota of the position
occupied by the Republican party on the subject of slavery in the
territories, and that he stands now, as he stood in May last, when he
accepted the nomination for the Presidency, square upon the Chicago
platform.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Thus Lincoln had reassured Greeley's shrinking faith,
and thenceforward his powerful journal took a more healthy and hopeful
tone.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Meantime, Weed laboured for the Crittenden compromise. He went to
Washington, interviewed Republican members of Congress, and finally
visited Lincoln at Springfield. Tickling the ear with a pleasing
sentiment and alliteration, he wanted Republicans, he said, &quot;to meet
secession as patriots and not as partisans.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> He especially urged
forbearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.344" id="Page_ii.344">ii. 344</a></span> and concession out of consideration for Union men in
Southern States. &quot;Apprehending that we should be called upon to test
the strength of the Government,&quot; he wrote, on January 9, 1861, &quot;we
saw, what is even more apparent now, that the effort would tax all its
faculties and strain all its energies. Hence our desire before the
trial came to make up a record that would challenge the approval of
the world. This was due not less to ourselves than to the Union men of
Southern States, who, with equal patriotism and more of sacrifice,
amidst the pitiless peltings of the disunion storm, sought, like the
dove sent out from the ark, a dry spot on which to set their
feet.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Weed's sincerity remained unquestioned, and his opinion, so ardently
supported outside his party, would probably have had weight within his
party under other conditions; but the President-elect, with his mind
inflexibly made up on the question of extending slavery into the
territories, refused to yield the cardinal principle of the Chicago
platform. &quot;Entertain no proposition for a compromise in regard to the
extension of slavery,&quot; he wrote, December 11, to William Kellogg, a
member of Congress from Illinois. &quot;The instant you do, they have us
under again; all our labour is lost, and sooner or later must be done
over.... The tug has to come, and better now than later. You know I
think the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be
enforced&#8212;to put it in its mildest form, ought not to be
resisted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Two days later, in a letter to E.B. Washburne, also an
Illinois member of Congress, he objected to the scheme for restoring
the Missouri Compromise line. &quot;Let that be done and immediately
filibustering and extending slavery recommences. On that point hold
firm as a chain of steel.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> To Weed himself, on December 17, he
repeated the same idea in almost the identical language.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.345" id="Page_ii.345">ii. 345</a></span></p><p>Thurlow Weed was a journalist of pre-eminent ability, and, although a
strenuous, hard hitter, who gave everybody as much sport as he wanted,
he was a fair fighter, whom the bitterest critics of the radical
Republican press united in praising for his consistency; but his
epigrams and incisive arguments, sending a vibrating note of
earnestness across the Alleghanies, could not move the modest and, as
yet, unknown man of the West, who, unswayed by the fears of Wall
Street, and the teachings of the great Whig compromisers, saw with a
statesman's clearness the principle that explained the reason for his
party's existence.</p>

1860-1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> the contest over secession was raising its crop of disturbance
and disorder at Washington, newspapers and politicians in the North
continued to discuss public questions from their party standpoints.
Republicans inveighed against the madness of pro-slavery leaders,
Democrats berated Republicans as the responsible authors of the perils
darkening the national skies, and Bell men sought for a compromise.
Four days after the election of Lincoln, the Albany <i>Argus</i> clearly
and temperately expressed the view generally taken of the secession
movement by Democratic journals of New York. &quot;We are not at all
surprised at the manifestations of feeling at the South,&quot; it said. &quot;We
expected and predicted it; and for so doing were charged by the
Republican press with favouring disunion; while, in fact, we simply
correctly appreciated the feeling of that section of the Union. We
sympathise with and justify the South, as far as this&#8212;their rights
have been invaded to the extreme limit possible within the forms of
the Constitution; and, if we deemed it certain that the real animus of
the Republican party could become the permanent policy of the nation,
we should think that all the instincts of self-preservation and of
manhood rightfully impelled them to resort to revolution and a
separation from the Union, and we would applaud them and wish them
God-speed in the adoption of such a remedy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.347" id="Page_ii.347">ii. 347</a></span></p>
<p>This was published in the heat of party conflict and Democratic
defeat, when writers assumed that a compromise, if any adjustment was
needed, would, of course, be forthcoming as in 1850. A little later,
as conditions became more threatening, the talk of peaceable secession
growing out of a disinclination to accept civil war, commended itself
to persons who thought a peaceful dissolution of the Union, if the
slave-holding South should seek it, preferable to such an
alternative.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> But as the spectre of dismemberment of the nation
came nearer, concessions to the South as expressed in the Weed plan,
and, later, in the Crittenden compromise, commended itself to a large
part of the people. A majority of the voters at the preceding election
undoubtedly favoured such an adjustment. The votes cast for Douglas,
Bell, and Breckenridge in the free States, with one-fourth of those
cast for Lincoln, and one-fourth for Breckenridge in the slave States,
making 2,848,792 out of a total of 4,662,170, said a writer in
<i>Appleton's Cyclop&#230;dia</i>, &quot;were overwhelmingly in favour of
conciliation, forbearance, and compromise.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Rhodes, the
historian, approving this estimate, expresses the belief that the
Crittenden compromise, if submitted to the people, would have
commanded such a vote.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>In the closing months of 1860, and the opening months of 1861, this
belief dominated the Democratic party as well as a large number of
conservative Republicans; but, as the winter passed without
substantial progress toward an effective compromise, the cloud of
trouble assumed larger proportions and an alarmist spirit spread
abroad. After Major Anderson, on the night of December 27, had
transferred his command from its exposed position at Fort Moultrie to
the stronger one at Fort Sumter, it was not uncommon to hear upon the
streets disloyal sentiments blended with those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.348" id="Page_ii.348">ii. 348</a></span> willing sacrifice
to maintain the Union. This condition was accentuated by the action of
the Legislature, which convened on January 2, 1861, with twenty-three
Republicans and nine Democrats in the Senate, and ninety-three
Republicans and thirty-five Democrats in the House. In his message,
Governor Morgan urged moderation and conciliation. &quot;Let New York,&quot; he
said, &quot;set an example; let her oppose no barrier, but let her
representatives in Congress give ready support to any just and
honourable sentiment; let her stand in hostility to none, but extend
the hand of friendship to all, cordially uniting with other members of
the Confederacy in proclaiming and enforcing a determination that the
Constitution shall be honoured and the Union of the States be
preserved.&quot;</p>

<p>On January 7, five days after this dignified and conservative appeal,
Fernando Wood, imitating the example of South Carolina, advocated the
secession of the city from the State. &quot;Why should not New York City,&quot;
said the Mayor, as if playing the part of a satirist, &quot;instead of
supporting by her contributions in revenue two-thirds of the expenses
of the United States, become, also, equally independent? As a free
city, with a nominal duty on imports, her local government could be
supported without taxation upon her people.... Thus we could live free
from taxes, and have cheap goods nearly duty free.... When disunion
has become a fixed and certain fact, why may not New York disrupt the
bands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master&#8212;to a people and a
party that have plundered her revenues, attempted to ruin her
commerce, taken away the power of self-government, and destroyed the
confederacy of which she was the proud empire city.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>By order of a sympathising common council, this absurd message,
printed in pamphlet form, was distributed among the people. Few,
however, took it seriously. &quot;Fernando Wood,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>,
&quot;evidently wants to be a traitor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.349" id="Page_ii.349">ii. 349</a></span> it is lack of courage only that
makes him content with being a blackguard.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The next day
Confederate forts fired upon the <i>Star of the West</i> while endeavouring
to convey troops and supplies to Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>The jar of the Mayor's message and the roar of hostile guns were
quickly followed by the passage, through the Legislature, of a
concurrent resolution, tendering the President &quot;whatever aid in men
and money may be required to enable him to enforce the laws and uphold
the authority of the Federal Government; and that, in the defence of
the Union, which has conferred prosperity and happiness upon the
American people, renewing the pledge given and redeemed by our
fathers, we are ready to devote our fortunes, our lives, and our
sacred honour.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> This resolution undoubtedly expressed the
overwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the State,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> but its
defiant tone, blended with the foolish words of Wood and the menacing
act of South Carolina, called forth greater efforts for compromise, to
the accomplishment of which a mammoth petition, signed by the leading
business men of the State, was sent to Congress, praying that
&quot;measures, either of direct legislation or of amendment of the
Constitution, may be speedily adopted, which, we are assured, will
restore peace to our agitated country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>On January 18, a meeting of the merchants of New York City, held in
the Chamber of Commerce, unanimously adopted a memorial, addressed to
Congress, urging the ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.350" id="Page_ii.350">ii. 350</a></span>ceptance of the Crittenden compromise. Similar
action to maintain peace in an honourable way was taken in other
cities of the State, while congressmen were daily loaded with appeals
favouring any compromise that would keep the peace. Among other
petitions of this character, Elbridge G. Spaulding presented one from
Buffalo, signed by Millard Fillmore, Henry W. Rogers, and three
thousand others. On January 24, Governor Morgan received resolutions,
passed by the General Assembly of Virginia, inviting the State,
through its Legislature, to send commissioners to a peace conference
to be held at Washington on February 4. Nothing had occurred in the
intervening weeks to change the sentiment of the Legislature,
expressed earlier in the session; but, after much discussion and many
delays, it was resolved, in acceding to the request of Virginia, that
&quot;it is not to be understood that this Legislature approves of the
propositions submitted, or concedes the propriety of their adoption by
the proposed convention. But while adhering to the position she has
heretofore occupied, New York will not reject an invitation to a
conference, which, by bringing together the men of both sections,
holds out the possibility of an honourable settlement of our national
difficulties, and the restoration of peace and harmony to the
country.&quot;</p>

<p>The balloting for commissioners resulted in the election of David
Dudley Field, William Curtis Noyes, James S. Wadsworth, James C.
Smith, Amaziah B. James, Erastus Corning, Francis Granger, Greene C.
Bronson, William E. Dodge, John A. King, and John E. Wool, with the
proviso, however, that they were to take no part in the proceedings
unless a majority of the non-slave-holding States were represented.
The appearance of Francis Granger upon the commission was the act of
Thurlow Weed. Granger, happy in his retirement at Canandaigua, had
been out of office and out of politics so many years that, as he said
in a letter to the editor of the <i>Evening Journal</i>, &quot;it is with the
greatest repugnance that I think of again appearing before the
public.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.351" id="Page_ii.351">ii. 351</a></span> Weed urged him, and Granger accepted &quot;the
flattering honour.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Thus, after many years of estrangement, the
leader of the Woolies clasped hands again with the chief of the
Silver-Grays.</p>

<p>Though a trifling event in itself, the detention of thirty-eight boxes
of muskets by the New York police kept the people conscious of the
strained relations between the States. The ownership of the guns, left
for shipment to Savannah, would ordinarily have been promptly settled
in a local court; but the detention now became an affair of national
importance, involving the governors of two States and leading to the
seizure of half a dozen merchant vessels lying peacefully at anchor in
Savannah harbour. Instead of entering the courts, the consignor
telegraphed the consignees of the &quot;seizure,&quot; the consignees notified
Governor Brown of Georgia, and the Governor wired Governor Morgan of
New York, demanding their immediate release. Receiving no reply to his
message, Brown, in retaliation, ordered the seizure of all vessels at
Savannah belonging to citizens of New York. Although Governor Morgan
gave the affair no attention beyond advising the vessel owners that
their rights must be prosecuted in the United States courts, the
shipment of the muskets and the release of the vessels soon closed the
incident; but Brown's indecent zeal to give the episode an
international character by forcing into notice the offensive
assumption of an independent sovereignty, had much influence in
hardening the &quot;no compromise&quot; attitude of many Northern people.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the men of New York who desired peace on any honourable
terms, seemed to grow more earnest as the alarm in the public mind
became more intense. South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Louisiana, and Mississippi had now seceded, and, as a last appeal to
them, a monster and notable Union meeting, held at Cooper Institute on
January 28 and addressed by eminent men of all parties, designated
James T. Brady, Cornelius K. Garrison, and Appleton Oaksmith, as
commissioners to confer with delegates to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.352" id="Page_ii.352">ii. 352</a></span> conventions of these
seceding States &quot;in regard to measures best calculated to restore the
peace and integrity of this Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Scarcely had the meeting
adjourned, however, before John A. Dix, as secretary of the treasury,
thrilled the country by his fearless and historic dispatch, &quot;If any
one attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.&quot;</p>

<p>Dix had brought to the Cabinet the training of a soldier and of a
wise, prudent, sagacious statesman of undaunted courage and integrity.
With the exception of his connection with the Barnburners in 1848, he
had been an exponent of the old Democratic traditions, and, next to
Horatio Seymour, did more, probably, than any other man to bring about
a reunion of his party in 1852. Nevertheless, the Southern politicians
never forgave him. President Pierce offered him the position of
secretary of state, and then withdrew it with the promise of sending
him as minister to France; but the South again defeated him. From that
time until his appointment as postmaster of New York, following the
discovery, in May, 1860, of Isaac V. Fowler's colossal
defalcation,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Dix had taken little part in politics. If the
President, however, needed a man of his ability and honesty in the
crisis precipitated by Fowler's embezzlement, such characteristics
were more in demand, in January, 1861, at the treasury, when the
government was compelled to pay twelve per cent. for a loan of five
millions, while New York State sevens were taken at an average of
101&#188;.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Bankers refused longer to furnish money until the
Cabinet contained men upon whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.353" id="Page_ii.353">ii. 353</a></span> friends of the government and the
Union could rely, and Buchanan, yielding to the inevitable, appointed
the man clearly indicated by the financiers.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>Although now sixty-three years old, with the energy and pluck of his
soldier days, Dix had no ambition to be in advance of his party. He
favoured the Crittenden compromise, advocated Southern rights under
the limits of the Constitution, and wrote to leaders in the South with
the familiarity of an old friend. &quot;I recall occasions,&quot; wrote his son,
&quot;when my father spoke to me on the questions of the day, disclosing
the grave trouble that possessed his thoughts. On one such occasion he
referred to the possibility that New York might become a free city,
entirely independent, in case of a general breakup;<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> not that he
advocated the idea, but he placed it in the category of possibilities.
It was his opinion that a separation, if sought by the South through
peaceful means alone, must be conceded by the North, as an evil less
than that of war.... Above all else, however, next to God, he loved
the country and the flag. He did everything in his power to avert the
final catastrophe. But when the question was reduced to that simple,
lucid proposition presented by the leaders of secession, he had but
one answer, and gave it with an emphasis and in words which were as
lightning coming out of the east and shining even unto the west.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.354" id="Page_ii.354">ii. 354</a></span></p><p>From the day of his appointment to the Treasury to the end of the
Administration, Dix resided at the White House as the guest of the
President, and under his influence, coupled with that of Black, Holt,
and Stanton, Buchanan assumed a more positive tone in dealing with
secession. Heretofore, with the exception of Major Anderson's
movements at Fort Sumter, and Lieutenant Slemmer's daring act at Fort
Pickens, the seizure of federal property had gone on without
opposition or much noise; but now, at last, a prominent New Yorker,
well known to every public man in the State, had flashed a patriotic
order into the heart of the Southern Confederacy, startling the
country into a realising sense of the likelihood of civil war.</p>

<p>In the midst of this excitement, a state convention, called by the
Democratic state committee and composed of four delegates from each
assembly district, representing the party of Douglas, of Breckenridge,
and of Bell and Everett, assembled at Albany on January 31. Tweddle
Hall was scarcely large enough to contain those who longed to be
present at this peace conference. Of the prominent public men of the
Commonwealth belonging to the three parties, the major part seemed to
make up the assemblage, which Greeley pronounced &quot;the strongest and
most imposing ever convened within the State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> On the platform
sat Horatio Seymour, Amasa J. Parker, and William Kelley, the Softs'
recent candidate for governor, while half a hundred men flanked them
on either side, who had been chosen to seats in Congress, in the
Legislature, and to other places of honour. &quot;No convention which had
nominations to make, or patronage to dispose of, was ever so
influentially constituted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Sanford E. Church of Albion became temporary chairman, and Amasa J.
Parker, president. Parker had passed his day of running for office,
but, still in the prime of life, only fifty-four years old, his
abilities ran with swiftness along many channels of industry. In
stating the object of the conven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.355" id="Page_ii.355">ii. 355</a></span>tion, the vociferous applause which
greeted his declaration that the people of the State, demanding a
peaceful settlement of the questions leading to disunion, have a right
to insist upon conciliation and compromise, disclosed the almost
unanimous sentiment of the meeting; but the after-discussion developed
differences that anticipated the disruption that was to come to the
Democratic party three months later. One speaker justified Southern
secession by urgent considerations of necessity and safety; another
scouted the idea of coercing a seceding State; to a third, peaceful
separation, though painful and humiliating, seemed the only safe and
honourable way. Reuben H. Walworth, the venerable ex-chancellor,
declared that civil war, instead of restoring the Union, would forever
defeat its reconstruction. &quot;It would be as brutal,&quot; he said, &quot;to send
men to butcher our own brethren of the Southern States, as it would be
to massacre them in the Northern States.&quot;</p>

<p>Horatio Seymour received the heartiest greeting. Whether for good or
evil, according to the standards by which his critics may judge him,
he swayed the minds of his party to a degree that was unequalled among
his contemporaries. For ten years his name had been the most
intimately associated with party policies, and his influence the most
potent. The exciting events of the past three months, with six States
out of the Union and revolution already begun, had profoundly stirred
him. He had followed the proceedings of Congress, he had studied the
disposition of the South, he understood the sentiment in the North,
and his appeal for a compromise, without committing himself to some of
the extravagances which were poured forth in absolute good faith by
Walworth, earned him enthusiastic commendation from friends and
admirers. &quot;The question is simply this,&quot; he said; &quot;Shall we have
compromise <i>after</i> war, or compromise <i>without</i> war?&quot; He eulogised the
valour of the South, he declared a blockade of its extended sea coast
nearly impossible, he hinted that successful coercion by the North
might not be less revolutionary than successful secession by the
South, he predicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.356" id="Page_ii.356">ii. 356</a></span> the ruin of Northern industries, and he scolded
Congress, urging upon it a compromise&#8212;not to pacify seceding States,
but to save border States. &quot;The cry of 'No compromise' is false in
morals,&quot; he declared; &quot;it is treason to the spirit of the
Constitution; it is infidelity in religion; the cross itself is a
compromise, and is pleaded by many who refuse all charity to their
fellow-citizens. It is the vital principle of social existence; it
unites the family circle; it sustains the church, and upholds
nationalities.... But the Republicans complain that, having won a
victory, we ask them to surrender its fruits. We do not wish them to
give up any political advantage. We urge measures which are demanded
by the hour and the safety of our Union. Are they making sacrifices,
when they do that which is required by the common welfare?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>It remained for George W. Clinton of Buffalo, the son of the
illustrious DeWitt Clinton, to lift the meeting to the higher plane of
genuine loyalty to the Union. Clinton was a Hard in politics. He had
stood with John A. Dix and Daniel S. Dickinson, had been defeated for
lieutenant-governor on their ticket, and had supported Breckenridge;
but when the fateful moment arrived at which a decision had to be made
for or against the country, his genius, like the prescience of Dix,
guided him rightly. &quot;Let us conciliate our erring brethren,&quot; he said,
&quot;who, under a strange delusion, have, as they say, seceded from us;
but, for God's sake, do not let us humble the glorious government
under which we have been so happy and which will yet do so much for
the happiness of mankind. Gentlemen, I hate to use a word that will
offend my Southern brother, but we have reached a time when, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.357" id="Page_ii.357">ii. 357</a></span> a
man&#8212;if you please, as a Democrat&#8212;I must use plain terms. There is no
such thing as legal secession. The Constitution of these United States
was intended to form a firm and perpetual Union. If secession be not
lawful, then, what is it? I use the term reluctantly but truly&#8212;it is
rebellion! rebellion against the noblest government man ever framed
for his own benefit and for the benefit of the world. What is it&#8212;this
secession? I am not speaking of the men. I love the men, but I hate
treason. What is it but nullification by the wholesale? I have
venerated Andrew Jackson, and my blood boiled, in old time, when that
brave patriot and soldier of Democracy said&#8212;'the Union, it must and
shall be preserved.' (Loud applause.) Preserve it? Why should we
preserve it, if it would be the thing these gentlemen would make it?
Why should we love a government that has no dignity and no power? Look
at it for a moment. Congress, for just cause, declares war, but one
State says, 'War is not for me&#8212;I secede.' And so another and another,
and the government is rendered powerless. I am not prepared to humble
the general government at the feet of the seceding States. I am
unwilling to say to the government, 'You must abandon your property,
you must cease to collect the revenues, because you are threatened.'
In other words, gentlemen, it seems to me&#8212;and I know I speak the
wishes of my constituents&#8212;that, while I abhor coercion, in one sense,
as war, I wish to preserve the dignity of the government of these
United States as well.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.358" id="Page_ii.358">ii. 358</a></span></p>
<p>The applause that greeted these loyal sentences disclosed a patriotic
sentiment, which, until then, had found no opportunity for expression;
yet the convention, in adopting a series of resolutions, was of one
mind on the question of submitting the Crittenden compromise to a
direct vote of the people. &quot;Their voice,&quot; said the chairman, &quot;will be
omnipresent here, and if it be raised in time it may be effectual
elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>There is something almost pathetic in the history of these efforts
which were made during the progress of secession, to avert, if
possible, the coming shock. The great peace conference, assembled by
the action of Virginia, belongs to these painful and wasted
endeavours. On February 4, the day that delegates from six cotton
States assembled at Montgomery to form a Southern confederacy, one
hundred and thirty-three commissioners, representing twenty-one
States, of which fourteen were non-slave-holding, met at Washington
and continued in session, sitting with closed doors, until the 27th.
It was a body of great dignity&#8212;a &quot;fossil convention,&quot; the <i>Tribune</i>
called it&#8212;whose proceedings, because of the desire in the public mind
to avoid civil war, attracted wide attention. David Dudley Field
represented New York on the committee on resolutions, which proposed
an amendment of seven sections to the Constitution. On February 26,
these were taken up in their order for passage. The first section
provided for the restoration of the Missouri Compromise line under the
then existing conditions, provided that whenever a new State was
formed north or south of that line it should be admitted with or
without slavery, as its constitution might declare. This was the
important concession; but, though it was less favourable to the South
than the Crittenden compromise, it failed to satisfy the radical
Republicans, who had from the first opposed the convention.
Accordingly, the vote, taken by States, stood eight to eleven against
it, New York being included among the noes. The next morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.359" id="Page_ii.359">ii. 359</a></span>
however, after agreeing to a reconsideration of the question, the
convention passed the section by a vote of nine to eight, New York,
divided by the absence of David Dudley Field, being without a voice in
its determination. Field never fully recovered from this apparent
breach of trust.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> In committee, he had earnestly opposed the
proposed amendment, talking almost incessantly for three weeks, but,
at the supreme moment, when the report came up for passage, he
withdrew from the convention, without explanation, thus depriving his
State of a vote upon all the sections save one, because of an evenly
divided delegation.</p>

<p>The convention, however, was doomed to failure before Field left it.
Very early in its life the eloquent New Yorker, assisting to rob it of
any power for good, declared his opposition to any amendment to the
Constitution. &quot;The Union,&quot; he said, &quot;is indissoluble, and no State can
secede. I will lay down my life for it.... We must have the
arbitration of reason, or the arbitrament of the sword.&quot; Amaziah B.
James, another New Yorker, possessed the same plainness of speech.
&quot;The North will not enter upon war until the South forces it to do
so,&quot; he said, mildly. &quot;But when you begin it, the government will
carry it on until the Union is restored and its enemies put
down.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> If any stronger Union sentiment were needed, the remarks
of Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, in disclosing the attitude of his party,
supplied it. &quot;The election of Lincoln,&quot; he said, &quot;must be regarded as
the triumph of principles cherished in the hearts of the people of the
free States. Chief among these principles is the restriction of
slavery within State limits; not war upon slavery within those limits,
but fixed opposition to its extension beyond them. By a fair and
unquestionable majority we have secured that triumph. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.360" id="Page_ii.360">ii. 360</a></span> think
we, who represent this majority, will throw it away? Do you think the
people would sustain us if we undertook to throw it away?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>After three weeks of such talk, even Virginia, whose share in forming
the Union exceeded that of any other State, manifested its
discouragement by repudiating the proposed amendment as an
insufficient guarantee for bringing back the cotton States or holding
the border States. When, finally, on March 4, the result of the
conference was offered in the United States Senate, only seven votes
were cast in its favour. So faded and died the last great effort for
compromise and peace. For months it must have been apparent to every
one that the party of Lincoln would not yield the corner-stone of its
principles. It desired peace, was quick to co-operate, and ready to
conciliate, but its purpose to preserve free territory for free labour
remained fixed and unalterable.</p>

<br />
WEED&#8217;S REVENGE UPON GREELEY<br />
<br />
1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">In the</span> winter of 1860-61, while the country was drifting into civil
war, a desperate struggle was going on at Albany to elect a United
States senator in place of William H. Seward, whose term expired on
the fourth of March. After the defeat of the Senator at Chicago,
sentiment settled upon his return to Washington; but when Lincoln
offered him the position of secretary of state, Thurlow Weed announced
William M. Evarts as his candidate for the United States Senate.
Evarts was now forty-three years of age. Born in Boston, a graduate of
Yale, and of the Harvard law school, he had been a successful lawyer
at the New York bar for twenty years. Union College had conferred upon
him, in 1857, the degree of Doctor of Laws, and the rare ability and
marvellous persistence manifested in the Lemmon slave case, in which
he was opposed by Charles O'Conor, had given abundant evidence of the
great intellectual powers that subsequently distinguished him. He had,
also, other claims to recognition. The wit and great learning that
made him the most charming of conversationalists increased his
popularity, while his love of books, his excellent taste, and good
manners made him welcome in the club and the social circle. Indeed, he
seems to have possessed almost every gift and grace that nature and
fortune could bestow, giving him high place among his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Evarts had not then held office. The places that O'Conor and Brady had
accepted presented no attractions for him; nor did he seem to desire
the varied political careers that had distinguished other brilliant
young members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.362" id="Page_ii.362">ii. 362</a></span> New York bar. But he had taken pleasure in
bringing to his party a wisdom in council which was only equalled by
his power in debate. If this service were insufficient to establish
his right to the exalted preferment he now sought, his recent valuable
work at the Chicago convention was enough to satisfy Thurlow Weed, at
least, that generous assistance of such surpassing value should be
richly rewarded.</p>

<p>Up to this time, Weed's authority in his party in the State had been
supreme. He failed to have his way in 1846 when John Young seized the
nomination for governor, and some confusion existed as to his
influence in the convention that selected Myron Clark in 1854; but for
all practical purposes Weed had controlled the Whig and Republican
parties since their formation, almost without dissent. Circumstances
sometimes favoured him. The hard times of 1837 made possible Seward's
election as governor; the split in the Democratic party over the
canal, and later over the Wilmot Proviso, secured Seward a seat in the
United States Senate; and the sudden and wholly unexpected repeal of
the Missouri Compromise defeated the Silver-Grays and aided in rapidly
reducing the strength of the Know-Nothings; but these changes in the
political situation, although letting Weed's party into power,
burdened his leadership with serious problems. It required a master
hand safely to guide a party between the Radical and Abolition
factions on one side and the Conservatives on the other, and his
signal success commended him to President Lincoln, who frequently
counselled with him, often inviting him to Washington by telegram
during the darkest days of civil war.</p>

<p>But the defection of Greeley, supplemented by William Cullen Bryant
and the union of radical leaders who came from the Democratic party,
finally blossomed into successful rebellion at Chicago. This
encouraged Greeley to lead one at Albany. The Legislature had one
hundred and sixteen Republican members, requiring fifty-nine to
nominate in caucus. Evarts could count on forty-two and Greeley upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.363" id="Page_ii.363">ii. 363</a></span>
about as many. In his effort to secure the remaining seventeen, Weed
discovered that Ira Harris had a considerable following, who were
indisposed to affiliate with Evarts, while several assemblymen
indicated a preference for other candidates. This precipitated a
battle royal. Greeley did not personally appear in Albany, but he
scorned none of the ordinary crafts of party management. Charles A.
Dana, then of the <i>Tribune</i>, represented him, and local leaders from
various parts of the State rallied to his standard and industriously
prosecuted his canvass. Their slogan was &quot;down with the Dictator.&quot; It
mattered not that they had approved Weed's management in the past,
their fight now proposed to end the one-man power, and every
place-hunter who could not secure patronage under Lincoln's
administration if Evarts went to the Senate, ranged himself against
Weed. On the side of the <i>Tribune's</i> editor, also, stood the
independent, whose dislike of a party boss always encourages him to
strike whenever the way is open to deal an effective blow. This was
Greeley's great strength. It marshalled itself.</p>

<p>Weed summoned all his hosts. Moses H. Grinnell, Simeon Draper, and A.
Oakey Hall led the charge, flanked by a cloud of state and county
officials, and an army of politicians who filled the hotels and
crowded the lobbies of the capitol. The <i>Tribune</i> estimated Evarts'
backers at not less than one thousand.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> For two weeks the battle
raged with all the characteristics of an intense personal conflict.
Greeley declared it &quot;a conflict which was to determine whether a
dynasty was to stand and give law to its subjects, or be overthrown
and annihilated. Fully appreciating this, not Richmond at Bosworth
Field, Charles at Naseby, nor Napoleon at Waterloo made a more
desperate fight for empire than did the one-man power at Albany to
retain the sceptre it has wielded for so many years over the politics
and placemen of this State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> In their desperation both sides
appealed to the President-elect, who refused to be drawn into the
struggle. &quot;Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.364" id="Page_ii.364">ii. 364</a></span> to all&quot; was his answer to Weed. &quot;I have said
nothing more particular to any one.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>As the canvass grew older, it became known that several of Harris'
supporters would go to Greeley whenever their assistance would
nominate him. This sacrifice, however, was not to be made so long as
Harris held the balance of power; and since Weed's desire to defeat
Greeley was well understood, Harris counted with some degree of
certainty upon Evarts' supporters whenever a serious break threatened.
Weed's relations with Harris were not cordial. For years they had
lived in Albany, and as early as 1846 their ways began to diverge; but
Harris' character for wisdom, learning, and integrity compelled
respect. He had been an assemblyman in 1844 and 1845, a state senator
in 1846, a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1846, and a
justice of the Supreme Court from 1847 to 1859. His name was familiar
throughout the State. From the time he took up the cause of the
Anti-Renters in 1846 he had possessed the confidence of the common
people, and his great fairness and courtesy upon the bench had added
largely to his reputation. He was without any pretence to oratory. The
gifts that made Evarts a leader of the New York bar for three decades
did not belong to him; but everybody knew that in the United States
Senate he would do as much as Evarts to uphold President Lincoln.</p>

<p>The caucus convened on the evening of February 4. Only one member was
absent. Weed and Evarts sat with Governor Morgan in the executive
chamber&#8212;Harris in the rooms of Lieutenant-Governor Campbell at
Congress Hall. The first ballot gave Evarts 42, Greeley 40, Harris 20,
with 13 scattering. Bets had been made that Evarts would get 50, and
some over-sanguine ones fixed it at 60. What Weed expected does not
appear; but the second ballot, which reduced Evarts to 39 and raised
Greeley to 42, did not please Speaker Littlejohn, who carried orders
between the executive and assembly chambers. It seemed to doom Evarts
to ultimate defeat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.365" id="Page_ii.365">ii. 365</a></span> chamber grew dark with the gloomy frowns of
men who had failed to move their stubborn representatives. The next
four ballots, quickly taken, showed little progress, but the seventh
raised Greeley to 47 and dropped Harris to 19, while Evarts held on at
39. An assurance that the object of their labours would be reached
with the assistance of some of Harris' votes on the next ballot, made
the friends of Greeley jubilant. It was equally apparent to the
astonished followers of the grim manager who was smoking vehemently in
the executive chamber, that Evarts would be unable to weather another
ballot. A crisis, therefore, was inevitable, but it was the crisis for
which Weed had been waiting and watching, and without hesitation he
sent word to elect Harris.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> This settled it. Greeley received 49,
Harris 60, with 6 scattering. Weed did not get all he wanted, but he
got revenge.</p>

<p>There were reasons other than revenge, however, that induced men
vigorously opposed to secession to resent the candidacy of Horace
Greeley.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The editor of the <i>Tribune</i> certainly did not want the
Southern States to secede, nor did he favour secession, as has often
been charged, but his peculiar treatment of the question immediately
after the November election gave the would-be secessionists comfort,
if it did not absolutely invite and encourage the South to believe in
the possibility of peaceable secession.</p>

<p>Greeley seems to have taken failure with apparent serenity. He
professed to regard it as the downfall of Weed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.366" id="Page_ii.366">ii. 366</a></span> rather than the defeat
of himself. His friends who knew of the antagonistic relations long
existing between Harris and Weed, said the <i>Tribune</i>, exultingly, were
willing to see Harris nominated, since &quot;he would become an agent for
the accomplishment of their main purpose&#8212;the overthrow of the
dictatorship, and the establishment upon its ruins of the principle of
political independence in thought and action.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> But whatever its
influence upon Weed, the nomination of Harris was a bitter
disappointment to Greeley. He was extraordinarily ambitious for public
preferment. The character or duties of the office seemed to make
little difference to him. Congressman, senator, governor,
lieutenant-governor, comptroller of state, and President of the United
States, at one time or another greatly attracted him, and to gain any
one of them he willingly lent his name or gave up his time; but never
did he come so near reaching the goal of his ambition as in February,
1861. The promise of Harris' supporters to transfer their votes
encouraged a confidence that was not misplaced. The Greeley men were
elated, the more ardent entertaining no doubt that the eighth ballot
would bring victory; and, had Weed delayed a moment longer, Greeley
must have been a United States senator. But Weed did not delay, and
Greeley closed his life with an office-holding record of ninety days
in Congress. Like George Borrow, he seemed never to realise that his
simple, clear, vigorous English was to be the crown of an undying
fame.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

LINCOLN, SEWARD, AND THE UNION<br />
<br />
1860-1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">As the</span> day approached for the opening of Congress on Monday, December
3, 1860, William H. Seward left Auburn for Washington. At this time he
possessed the most powerful influence of any one in the Republican
party. While other leaders, his rivals in eloquence and his peers in
ability, exercised great authority, the wisdom of no one was more
widely appreciated, or more frequently drawn upon. &quot;Sumner, Trumbull,
and Wade,&quot; says McClure, speaking from personal acquaintance, &quot;had
intellectual force, but Trumbull was a judge rather than a politician,
Wade was oppressively blunt, and Sumner cultivated an ideal
statesmanship that placed him outside the line of practical politics.
Fessenden was more nearly a copy of Seward in temperament and
discretion, but readily conceded the masterly ability of his
colleague. Seward was not magnetic like Clay or Blaine, but he knew
how to make all welcome who came within range of his presence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Thus far, since the election, Seward had remained silent upon the
issues that now began to disturb the nation. Writing to Thurlow Weed
on November 18, 1860, he declared he was &quot;without schemes or plans,
hopes, desires, or fears for the future, that need trouble anybody so
far as I am concerned.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Nevertheless, he had scarcely reached the
capital before he discovered that he was charged with being the author
of Weed's compromise policy. &quot;Here's a muss,&quot; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.368" id="Page_ii.368">ii. 368</a></span> wrote, on December
3. &quot;Republican members stopped at the <i>Tribune</i> office on their way,
and when they all lamented your articles, Dana told them they were not
yours but mine; that I 'wanted to make a great compromise like Clay
and Webster.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>To Republicans it did not seem possible that Weed's plan of
conciliation, so carefully and ably presented, could be published
without the assistance, or, at least, the approval of his warm
personal and political friend,&#8212;an impression that gained readier
credence because of the prompt acquiescence of the New York <i>Times</i>
and the <i>Courier</i>. Seward, however, quickly punctured Charles A.
Dana's misinformation, and continued to keep his own counsels. &quot;I talk
very little, and nothing in detail,&quot; he wrote his wife, on December 2;
&quot;but I am engaged busily in studying and gathering my thoughts for the
Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> To Weed, on the same day, he gave the political
situation. &quot;South Carolina is committed. Georgia will debate, but she
probably follows South Carolina. Mississippi and Alabama likely to
follow.... Members are coming in, all in confusion. Nothing can be
agreed on in advance, but silence for the present, which I have
insisted must not be <i>sullen</i>, as last year, but respectful and
fraternal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>Seward, who had now been in Washington several days, had not broken
silence even to his Republican colleagues in the Senate, and &quot;to smoke
him out,&quot; as one of them expressed it, a caucus was called. But it
failed of its purpose. &quot;Its real object,&quot; he wrote Weed, &quot;was to find
out whether I authorised the <i>Evening Journal</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Courier</i>
articles. I told them they would know what I think and what I propose
when I do myself. The Republican party to-day is as uncompromising as
the secessionists in South Carolina. A month hence each may come to
think that moderation is wiser.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.369" id="Page_ii.369">ii. 369</a></span></p>
<p>It is not easy to determine from his correspondence just what was in
Seward's mind from the first to the thirteenth of December, but it is
plain that he was greatly disturbed. Nothing seemed to please him.
Weed's articles perplexed<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> him; his colleagues distrusted<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
him; the debates in the Senate were hasty and feeble;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> few had any
courage or confidence in the Union;<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> and the action of the Sumner
radicals annoyed him.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Rhodes, the historian, says he was
wavering.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> He was certainly waiting,&#8212;probably to hear from
Lincoln; but while he waited his epigrammatic criticism of Buchanan's
message, which he wrote his wife on December 5, got into the
newspapers and struck a popular note. &quot;The message shows
conclusively,&quot; he said, &quot;that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.370" id="Page_ii.370">ii. 370</a></span> the duty of the President to
execute the laws&#8212;unless somebody opposes him; and that no State has a
right to go out of the Union&#8212;unless it wants to.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>On December 13 Seward received the desired letter from the
President-elect, formally tendering him the office of secretary of
state. The proffer was not unexpected. Press and politicians had
predicted it and conceded its propriety. &quot;From the day of my
nomination at Chicago,&quot; Lincoln said, in an informal and confidential
letter of the same day, &quot;it has been my purpose to assign you, by your
leave, this place in the Administration. I have delayed so long to
communicate that purpose, in deference to what appeared to me a proper
caution in the case. Nothing has been developed to change my view in
the premises; and I now offer you the place in the hope that you will
accept it, and with the belief that your position in the public eye,
your integrity, ability, learning, and great experience all combine to
render it an appointment pre-eminently fit to be made.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>In the recent campaign Seward had attracted such attention and aroused
such enthusiasm, that James Russell Lowell thought his magnanimity,
since the result of the convention was known, &quot;a greater ornament to
him and a greater honour to his party than his election to the
Presidency would have been.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Seward's friends had followed his
example. &quot;We all feel that New York and the friends of Seward have
acted nobly,&quot; wrote Leonard Swett to Weed.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> A month after the
offer of the portfolio had been made, Lincoln wrote Seward that &quot;your
selection for the state department having become public, I am happy to
find scarcely any objection to it. I shall have trouble with every
other cabinet appointment&#8212;so much so, that I shall have to defer them
as long as possible, to avoid being teased into insanity, to make
changes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.371" id="Page_ii.371">ii. 371</a></span></p><p>In 1849, Seward had thought the post of minister, or even secretary of
state, without temptations for him, but, in 1860, amidst the gathering
clouds of a grave crisis, the championship of the Union in a great
political arena seemed to appeal, in an exceptional degree, to his
desire to help guide the destinies of his country; and, after
counselling with Weed at Albany, and with his wife at Auburn, he wrote
the President-elect that he thought it his duty to accept the
appointment.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Between the time of its tender and of its acceptance
Seward had gained a clear understanding of Lincoln's views; for, after
his conference with Weed, the latter visited Springfield and obtained
a written statement from the President-elect. This statement has never
appeared in print, but it practically embodied the sentiment written
Kellogg and Washburn, and which was received by them after Seward left
Washington for Auburn.</p>

<p>With this information the Senator returned to the capital, stopping
over night at the Astor House in New York, where he unexpectedly found
the New England Society celebrating Forefathers' Day. The knowledge of
his arrival quickly reached the banqueters. They knew that Weed had
seen Lincoln, and that, to hear the tidings from Springfield, Seward
had travelled with his friend from Syracuse to Albany. Eagerly,
therefore, they pressed him for a speech, for words spoken by the man
who would occupy the first place in Lincoln's Cabinet, meant to the
business men of the great metropolis, distracted by the disturbed
conditions growing out of the disunion movement, words of national
salvation. Seward never spoke from impulse. He understood the value of
silence and the necessity of thought before utterance. All of his many
great speeches were prepared in a most painstaking manner. But, as
many members of the society were personal or political friends, he
consented to address them, talking briefly and with characteristic
optimism, though without disclosing Lincoln's position or his own on
the question of compromise. &quot;I know that the necessities which created
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.372" id="Page_ii.372">ii. 372</a></span> Union,&quot; he said, in closing, &quot;are stronger to-day than they were
when the Union was cemented; and that these necessities are as
enduring as the passions of men are short-lived and effervescent. I
believe that the cause of secession was as strong, on the night of
November 6, when the President and Vice President were elected, as it
has been at any time. Some fifty days have now passed; and I believe
that every day the sun has set since that time, it has set upon
mollified passions and prejudices; and if you will only await the
time, sixty more suns will shed a light and illuminate a more cheerful
atmosphere.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>This speech has been severely criticised for its unseemly jest, its
exuberant optimism, and its lack of directness. It probably discloses,
in the copy published the next morning, more levity than it seemed to
possess when spoken, with its inflections and intonations, while its
optimism, made up of hopeful generalities which were not true, and of
rhetorical phrases that could easily be misapprehended, appeared to
sustain the suggestion that he did not realise the critical juncture
of affairs. But the assertion that he predicted the &quot;war will be over
in sixty days&quot; was a ridiculous perversion of his words. No war
existed at that time, and his &quot;sixty suns&quot; plainly referred to the
sixty days that must elapse before Lincoln's inauguration.
Nevertheless, the &quot;sixty days prediction,&quot; as it was called, was
repeated and believed for many years.</p>

<p>The feature of the speech that makes it peculiarly interesting,
however, is its strength in the advocacy of the Union. Seward believed
that he had a difficult role to play. Had he so desired he could not
support the restoration of the Missouri Compromise line, for the
President-elect had ruled inflexibly against it; neither could he
openly oppose it, lest it hurry the South into some overt act of
treason before Lincoln's inauguration. So he began exalting the Union,
skilfully creating the impression, at least by inference, that he
would not support the compromise, although his hearers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.373" id="Page_ii.373">ii. 373</a></span> readers
held to the belief that he would have favoured it had he not submitted
to Lincoln's leadership by accepting the state department.</p>

<p>During Seward's absence from Washington he was placed upon the Senate
committee of thirteen to consider the Crittenden compromise. It was
admitted that the restoration of the Missouri line was the nub of the
controversy; that, unless it could be accepted, compromise would fail;
and that failure meant certain secession. &quot;War of a most bitter and
sanguinary character will be sure to follow,&quot; wrote Senator Grimes of
Iowa.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> &quot;The heavens are, indeed, black,&quot; said Dawes of
Massachusetts, &quot;and an awful storm is gathering. I am well-nigh
appalled at its awful and inevitable consequences.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Seward did
not use words of such alarming significance, but he appreciated the
likelihood of secession. On December 26 he wrote Lincoln that
&quot;sedition will be growing weaker and loyalty stronger every day from
the acts of secession as they occur;&quot; but, in the same letter, he
added: &quot;South Carolina has already taken the attitude of defiance.
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana have pushed on to the
same attitude. I think that they could not be arrested, even if we
should offer all you suggest, and with it the restoration of the
Missouri Compromise line.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> To his wife, also, to whom alone he
confided his secret thoughts, he wrote, on the same day: &quot;The South
will force on the country the issue that the free States shall admit
that slaves are property, and treat them as such, or else there will
be a secession.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Republican senators of the committee of thirteen,
inspired by the firm attitude of Lincoln, voted against the first
resolution of the Crittenden compromise. They consented that Congress
should have no power either to abolish slavery in the District of
Columbia without compen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.374" id="Page_ii.374">ii. 374</a></span>sation and the consent of its inhabitants, or
to prohibit the transportation of slaves between slave-holding States
and territories; but they refused to protect slavery south of the
Missouri line, especially since such an amendment, by including future
acquisitions of territory, would, as Lincoln declared, popularise
filibustering for all south of us. &quot;A year will not pass till we shall
have to take Cuba as a condition upon which they will stay in the
Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Upon the failure of the Crittenden compromise, Seward, on the part of
the Republicans, offered five propositions, declaring (1) that the
Constitution should never be altered so as to authorise Congress to
abolish or interfere with slavery in the States; (2) that the fugitive
slave law should be amended by granting a jury trial to the fugitive;
(3) that Congress recommend the repeal by the States of personal
liberty acts which contravene the Constitution or the laws; (4) that
Congress pass an efficient law for the punishment of all persons
engaged in the armed invasion of any State from another; and (5) to
admit into the Union the remaining territory belonging to the United
States as two States, one north and one south of the parallel of 36&#176;
30&#180;, with the provision that these States might be subdivided and new
ones erected therefrom whenever there should be sufficient population
for one representative in Congress upon sixty thousand square
miles.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Only the first of these articles was adopted. Southern
Democrats objected to the second on principle, and to the third on the
ground that it would affect their laws imprisoning coloured seamen,
while they defeated the fourth by amending it into Douglas' suggestion
for the revival of the sedition law of John Adams'
administration.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> This made it unacceptable to the Republicans. The
fifth failed because it gave the South no opportunity of acquiring
additional slave lands. On December 28, therefore, the committee,
after adopting a resolution that it could not agree, closed its
labours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.375" id="Page_ii.375">ii. 375</a></span></p><p>This seemed to Jefferson Davis, who, in 1860, had assumed the
leadership laid down by John C. Calhoun in 1850, to end all effort at
compromise, and, on January 10, 1861, in a carefully prepared speech,
he argued the right of secession. Finally, turning to the Republicans,
he said: &quot;Your platform on which you elected your candidate denies us
equality. Your votes refuse to recognise our domestic institutions
which pre-existed the formation of the Union, our property which was
guarded by the Constitution. You refuse us that equality without which
we should be degraded if we remained in the Union. You elect a
candidate upon the basis of sectional hostility; one who, in his
speeches, now thrown broadcast over the country, made a distinct
declaration of war upon our institutions.... What boots it to tell me
that no direct act of aggression will be made? I prefer direct to
indirect hostile measures which will produce the same result. I prefer
it, as I prefer an open to a secret foe. Is there a senator upon the
other side who to-day will agree that we shall have equal enjoyment of
the territories of the United States? Is there one who will deny that
we have equally paid in their purchases, and equally bled in their
acquisition in war? Then, is this the observance of your contract?
Whose is the fault if the Union be dissolved?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>The country looked to Seward to make answer to these direct questions.
Southern States were hurrying out of the Union. South Carolina had
seceded on December 20, Mississippi on January 9, Florida on the 10th,
and Alabama on the 11th. Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas were preparing
to follow. The people felt that if a settlement was to come it must be
made quickly. &quot;Your propositions would have been most welcome if they
had been made before any question of coercion, and before any vain
boastings of powers,&quot; Davis had said. &quot;But you did not make them when
they would have been effective. I presume you will not make them
now.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>If the position of the New York senator had been an embar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.376" id="Page_ii.376">ii. 376</a></span>rassing one
at the Astor House on December 22, it was much more difficult on
January 12. He had refused to vote for the Crittenden compromise.
Moreover, the only proposition he had to make stood rejected by the
South. What could he say, therefore, that would settle anything? Yet
the desire to hear him was intense. An eye-witness described the scene
as almost unparalleled in the Senate. &quot;By ten o'clock,&quot; wrote this
observer, &quot;every seat in the gallery was filled, and by eleven the
cloak-rooms and all the passages were choked up, and a thousand men
and women stood outside the doors, although the speech was not to
begin until one o'clock. Several hundred visitors came on from
Baltimore. It was the fullest house of the session, and by far the
most respectful one.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Such was the faith of the South in Seward's
unbounded influence with Northern senators and Northern people that
the Richmond <i>Whig</i> asserted that his vote for the Crittenden
compromise &quot;would give peace at once to the country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Seward was not unmindful of this influence. &quot;My own party trusts me,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;but not without reservation. All the other parties, North
and South, cast themselves upon me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Judged by his letters at
this period, it is suggested that he had an overweening sense of his
own importance; he thought that he held in his hands the destinies of
his country.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> However this may be, it is certain that he wanted to
embarrass Lincoln by no obstacles of his making. &quot;I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.377" id="Page_ii.377">ii. 377</a></span> gain time,&quot;
he said, &quot;for the new Administration to organise and for the frenzy of
passion to subside. I am doing this, without making any compromise
whatever, by forbearance, conciliation, magnanimity. What I say and do
is said and done, not in view of personal objects, and I am leaving to
posterity to decide upon my action and conduct.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>In this spirit Seward made his speech of January 12. He discussed the
fallacies of secession, showing that it had no grounds, or even
excuse, and declaring that disunion must lead to civil war. Then he
avowed his adherence to the Union in its integrity and in every event,
&quot;whether of peace or of war, with every consequence of honour or
dishonour, of life or death.&quot; Referring to the disorder, he said: &quot;I
know not to what extent it may go. Still my faith in the Constitution
and in the Union abides. Whatever dangers there shall be, there will
be the determination to meet them. Whatever sacrifices, private or
public, shall be needful for the Union, they will be made. I feel sure
that the hour has not come for this great nation to fall.&quot;</p>

<p>In blazing the new line of thought which characterised his speech at
the Astor House, Seward rose to the plane of higher patriotism, and he
now broadened and enlarged the idea. During the presidential campaign,
he said, the struggle had been for and against slavery. That contest
having ended by the success of the Republicans in the election, the
struggle was now for and against the Union. &quot;Union is not more the
body than liberty is the soul of the nation. Freedom can be saved with
the Union, and cannot be saved without it.&quot; He deprecated mutual
criminations and recriminations, a continuance of the debate over
slavery in the territories, the effort to prove secession illegal, and
the right of the federal government to coerce seceding States. He
wanted the Union glorified, its blessings exploited, the necessity of
its existence made manifest, and the love of country substituted for
the prejudice of faction and the pride of party. When this millennial
day had come, when secession movements had ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.378" id="Page_ii.378">ii. 378</a></span> and the public mind
had resumed its wonted calm, then a national convention might be
called&#8212;say, in one, two, or three years hence, to consider the matter
of amending the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>This speech was listened to with deep attention. &quot;During the delivery
of portions of it,&quot; said one correspondent, &quot;senators were in tears.
When the sad picture of the country, divided into confederacies, was
given, Mr. Crittenden, who sat immediately before the orator, was
completely overcome by his emotions, and bowed his white head to
weep.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The <i>Tribune</i> considered it &quot;rhetorically and as a
literary performance unsurpassed by any words of Seward's earlier
productions,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and Whittier, charmed with its conciliatory tone,
paid its author a noble tribute in one of his choicest poems.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.379" id="Page_ii.379">ii. 379</a></span> the country was disappointed. The Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>,
representing the Virginia secessionists, maintained that it destroyed
the last hope of compromise, because he gave up nothing, not even
prejudices, to save peace in the Union. For the same reason, Union men
of Kentucky and other border States turned from it with profound
grief. On the other hand, the radical Republicans, disappointed that
it did not contain more powder and shot, charged him with surrendering
his principles and those of his party, to avert civil war and
dissolution of the Union. But the later-day historian, however,
readily admits that the rhetorical words of this admirable speech had
an effectual influence in making fidelity to the Union, irrespective
of previous party affiliations, a rallying point for Northern men.</p>

<p>As the recognised representative of the President-elect, Seward now
came into frequent conference with loyal men of both sections and of
all parties, including General Scott and the new members of Buchanan's
Cabinet. John A. Dix had become secretary of the treasury, Edwin
Stanton attorney-general, and Jeremiah S. Black secretary of state.
Seward knew them intimately, and with Black he conferred publicly.
With Stanton, however, it seemed advisable to select midnight as the
hour and a basement as the place of conference. &quot;At length,&quot; he wrote
Lincoln, &quot;I have gotten a position in which I can see what is going on
in the councils of the President.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> To his wife, he adds: &quot;The
revolution gathers apace. It has its abettors in the White House, the
treasury, the interior. I have assumed a sort of dictatorship for
defence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> He advised the President-elect to reach Washington
somewhat earlier than usual, and suggested having his secretaries of
war and navy designated that they might co-operate in measures for the
public safety. Under his advice, on the theory that the national
emblem would strengthen wavering minds and develop Union sentiment,
flags began to appear on stores and private residences. Sew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.380" id="Page_ii.380">ii. 380</a></span>ard was
ablaze with zeal. &quot;Before I spoke,&quot; he wrote Weed, &quot;not one utterance
made for the Union elicited a response. Since I spoke, every word for
the Union brings forth a cheering response.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>But, amidst it all, Seward's enemies persistently charged him with
inclining to the support of the Crittenden compromise. &quot;We have
positive information from Washington,&quot; declared the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;that a
compromise on the basis of Mr. Crittenden's is sure to be carried
through Congress either this week or the next, provided a very few
more Republicans can be got to enlist in the enterprise.... Weed goes
with the Breckenridge Democrats.... The same is true, though less
decidedly, of Seward.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> It is probable that in the good-fellowship
of after-dinner conversations Seward's optimistic words and
&quot;mysterious allusions,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> implied more than he intended them to
convey, but there is not a private letter or public utterance on which
to base the <i>Tribune's</i> statements. Greeley's attacks, however, became
frequent now. Having at last swung round to the &quot;no compromise&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.381" id="Page_ii.381">ii. 381</a></span>
policy of the radical wing of his party, he found it easy to condemn
the attitude of Weed and the Unionism of Seward, against whom his
lieutenants at Albany were waging a fierce battle for his election as
United States senator.</p>

<p>On January 31, Seward had occasion to present a petition, with
thirty-eight thousand signatures, which William E. Dodge and other
business men of New York had brought to Washington, praying for &quot;the
exercise of the best wisdom of Congress in finding some plan for the
adjustment of the troubles which endanger the safety of the nation,&quot;
and in laying it before the Senate he took occasion to make another
plea for the Union. &quot;I have asked them,&quot; he said, &quot;that at home they
act in the same spirit, and manifest their devotion to the Union,
above all other interests, by speaking for the Union, by voting for
the Union, by lending and giving their money for the Union, and, in
the last resort, fighting for the Union&#8212;taking care, always, that
speaking goes before voting, voting goes before giving money, and all
go before a battle. This is the spirit in which I have determined for
myself to come up to this great question, and to pass through it.&quot;</p>

<p>Senator Mason of Virginia, declaring that &quot;a maze of generalities
masked the speech,&quot; pressed Seward as to what he meant by
&quot;contributing money for the Union.&quot; Seward replied: &quot;I have
recommended to them in this crisis, that they sustain the government
of this country with the credit to which it is entitled at their
hands.&quot; To this Mason said: &quot;I took it for granted that the money was
to sustain the army which was to conduct the fight that he recommends
to his people.&quot; Seward responded: &quot;If, then, this Union is to stand or
fall by the force of arms, I have advised my people to do, as I shall
be ready to do myself&#8212;stand with it or perish with it.&quot; To which the
Virginia Senator retorted: &quot;The honourable senator proposes but one
remedy to restore this Union, and that is the <i>ultima ratio regna</i>.&quot;
Seward answered quickly, &quot;Not to restore&#8212;preserve!&quot;</p>

<p>Mason then referred to Seward's position as one of battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.382" id="Page_ii.382">ii. 382</a></span> and
bloodshed, to be fought on Southern soil, for the purpose of reducing
the South to colonies. To Seward, who was still cultivating the
attitude of &quot;forbearance, conciliation, and magnanimity,&quot; this sounded
like a harsh conclusion of the position he had sought to sugar-coat
with much rhetoric, and, in reply, he pushed bloodshed into the
far-off future by restating what he had already declared in fine
phrases, closing as follows: &quot;Does not the honourable senator know
that when all these [suggestions for compromise] have failed, then the
States of this Union, according to the forms of the Constitution,
shall take up this controversy about twenty-four negro slaves
scattered over a territory of one million and fifty thousand square
miles, and say whether they are willing to sacrifice all this liberty,
all this greatness, and all this hope, because they have not
intelligence, wisdom, and virtue enough to adjust a controversy so
frivolous and contemptible.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>Seward's speech plainly indicated a purpose to fight for the
preservation of the Union, and his talk of first exhausting
conciliatory methods was accepted in the South simply as a &quot;resort to
the gentle powers of seduction,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> but his argument of the few
slaves in the great expanse of territory sounded so much like Weed,
who was advocating with renewed strength the Crittenden plan along
similar lines of devotion to the Union, that it kept alive in the
North the impression that the Senator would yet favour compromise, and
gave Greeley further opportunity to assail him. &quot;Seward, in his speech
on Thursday last,&quot; says the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;declares his readiness to
renounce Republican principles for the sake of the Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The
next day his strictures were more pronounced. &quot;The Republican party
... is to be divided and sacrificed if the thing can be done. We are
boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.383" id="Page_ii.383">ii. 383</a></span> told it must be suppressed, and a Union party rise upon its
ruins.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Yet, in spite of such criticism, Seward bore himself with
indomitable courage and with unfailing skill. Never during his whole
career did he prove more brilliant and resourceful as a leader in what
might be called an utterly hopeless parliamentary struggle for the
preservation of the Union, and the highest tributes<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> paid to his
never-failing tact and temper during some of the most vivid and
fascinating passages of congressional history, attest his success. It
was easy to say, with Senator Chandler of Michigan, that &quot;without a
little blood-letting this Union will not be worth a rush,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> but it
required great skill to speak for the preservation of the Union and
the retention of the corner-stone of the Republican party, without
grieving the Unionists of the border States, or painfully affecting
the radical Republicans of the Northern States. Seward knew that the
latter censured him, and in a letter to the <i>Independent</i> he explains
the cause of it. &quot;Twelve years ago,&quot; he wrote, &quot;freedom was in danger
and the Union was not. I spoke then so singly for freedom that
short-sighted men inferred that I was disloyal to the Union. To-day,
practically, freedom is not in danger, and Union is. With the attempt
to maintain Union by civil war, <i>wantonly</i> brought on, there would be
danger of reaction against the Administration charged with the
preservation of both freedom and Union. Now, therefore, I speak singly
for Union, striving, if possible, to save it peaceably; if not
possible, then to cast the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.384" id="Page_ii.384">ii. 384</a></span> responsibility upon the party of slavery.
For this singleness of speech I am now suspected of infidelity to
freedom.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln, after his arrival in Washington, asked Seward to suggest such
changes in his inaugural address as he thought advisable, and in the
performance of this delicate duty the New York Senator continued his
policy of conciliation. &quot;I have suggested,&quot; he wrote, in returning the
manuscript, &quot;many changes of little importance, severally, but in
their general effect, tending to soothe the public mind. Of course the
concessions are, as they ought to be, if they are to be of avail, at
the cost of the winning, the triumphant party. I do not fear their
displeasure. They will be loyal whatever is said. Not so the defeated,
irritated, angered, frenzied party.... Your case is quite like that of
Jefferson. He brought the first Republican party into power against
and over a party ready to resist and dismember the government.
Partisan as he was, he sank the partisan in the patriot, in his
inaugural address; and propitiated his adversaries by declaring, 'We
are all Federalists; all Republicans.' I could wish that you would
think it wise to follow this example, in this crisis. Be sure that
while all your administrative conduct will be in harmony with
Republican principles and policy, you cannot lose the Republican party
by practising, in your advent to office, the magnanimity of a
victor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Of thirty-four changes suggested by Seward, the President-elect
adopted twenty-three outright, and based modifications on eight
others. Three were ignored. Upon only one change did the Senator
really insist. He thought the two paragraphs relating to the
Republican platform adopted at Chicago should be omitted, and, in
obedience to his judgment, Lincoln left them out. Seward declared the
argument of the address strong and conclusive, and ought not in any
way be changed or modified, &quot;but something besides, or in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.385" id="Page_ii.385">ii. 385</a></span> to
argument, is needful,&quot; he wrote in a postscript, &quot;to meet and remove
<i>prejudice</i> and <i>passion</i> in the South, and <i>despondency</i> and <i>fear</i>
in the East. Some words of affection. Some of calm and cheerful
confidence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> In line with this suggestion, he submitted the draft
of two concluding paragraphs. The first, &quot;made up of phrases which had
become extremely commonplace by iteration in the six years' slavery
discussion,&quot; was clearly inadmissible.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The second was as follows:
&quot;I close. We are not, we must not be, aliens or enemies, but fellow
countrymen and brethren. Although passion has strained our bonds of
affection too hardly, they must not, I am sure they will not, be
broken. The mystic chords which, proceeding from so many battle-fields
and so many patriot graves, pass through all the hearts and all the
hearths in this broad continent of ours, will yet again harmonise in
their ancient music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of the
nation.&quot;</p>

<p>This was the germ of a fine poetic thought, says John Hay, that &quot;Mr.
Lincoln took, and, in a new development and perfect form, gave to it
the life and spirit and beauty which have made it celebrated.&quot; As it
appears in the President-elect's clear, firm handwriting, it reads as
follows: &quot;I am loth to close. We are not enemies but friends. We must
not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break
our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from
every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and
hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of
the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better
angels of our nature.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.386" id="Page_ii.386">ii. 386</a></span></p>
<p>The spirit that softened Lincoln's inaugural into an appeal that
touched every heart, had breathed into the debates of Congress the
conciliation and forbearance that marked the divide between the
conservative and radical Republican. This difference, at the last
moment, occasioned Lincoln much solicitude. He had come to Washington
with his Cabinet completed except as to a secretary of the treasury
and a secretary of war. For the latter place Seward preferred Simon
Cameron, and, in forcing the appointment by his powerful advocacy, he
dealt a retributive blow to Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania, who had
vigorously opposed him at Chicago and was now the most conspicuous of
Cameron's foes.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> But Senator Chase of Ohio, to whom Seward
strenuously objected because of his uncompromising attitude, was given
the treasury. The shock of this defeat led the New York Senator to
decline entering the Cabinet. &quot;Circumstances which have occurred since
I expressed my willingness to accept the office of secretary of
state,&quot; he wrote, on March 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.387" id="Page_ii.387">ii. 387</a></span> &quot;seem to me to render it my duty to ask
leave to withdraw that consent.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The reception of the unexpected note sent a shiver through Lincoln's
stalwart form. This was the man of men with whom for weeks he had
confidentially conferred, and upon whose judgment and information he
had absolutely relied and acted, &quot;I cannot afford to let Seward take
the first trick,&quot; he said to his secretary,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> after pondering the
matter during Sunday, and on Monday morning, while the inauguration
procession was forming, he penned a reply. &quot;Your note,&quot; he said, &quot;is
the subject of the most painful solicitude with me; and I feel
constrained to beg that you will countermand the withdrawal. The
public interest, I think, demands that you should; and my personal
feelings are deeply enlisted in the same direction. Please consider
and answer by nine o'clock a.m. to-morrow.&quot; That night, after the
day's pageant and the evening's reception had ended, the President and
Seward talked long and confidentially, resulting in the latter's
withdrawal of his letter and his nomination and confirmation as
secretary of state. &quot;The President is determined that he will have a
compound Cabinet,&quot; Seward wrote his wife, a few days after the unhappy
incident; &quot;and that it shall be peaceful, and even permanent. I was at
one time on the point of refusing&#8212;nay, I did refuse, for a time, to
hazard myself in the experiment. But a distracted country appeared
before me, and I withdrew from that position. I believe I can endure
as much as any one; and may be that I can endure enough to make the
experiment successful.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> story of the first forty days of Lincoln's administration is one
of indecent zeal to obtain office. A new party had come into power,
and, in the absence of any suggestion of civil service, patronage was
conceded to the political victors. Office-seekers in large numbers had
visited Washington in 1841 after the election of President Harrison,
and, in the change that followed the triumph of Taylor in 1848,
Seward, then a new senator, complained of their pernicious activity.
Marcy as secretary of state found them no less numerous and insistent
in 1853 when the Whigs again gave way to the Democrats. But never in
the history of the country had such a cloud of applicants settled down
upon the capital of the nation as appeared in 1861. McClure, an
eye-witness of the scene, speaks of the &quot;mobs of office-seekers,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
and Edwin M. Stanton, who still remained in Washington, wrote Buchanan
that &quot;the scramble for office is terrific. Every department is
overrun, and by the time all the patronage is distributed the

and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.389" id="Page_ii.389">ii. 389</a></span> egress difficult.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Lincoln himself said: &quot;I seem like one

<p>In this bewildering mass of humanity New York had its share. Seward
sought protection behind his son, Frederick W. Seward, whom the
President had appointed assistant secretary of state. &quot;I have placed
him where he must meet the whole army of friends seeking office,&quot; he
wrote his wife on March 8&#8212;&quot;an hundred taking tickets when only one
can draw a prize.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Roscoe Conkling, then beginning his second
term in Congress, needed no barrier of this kind. &quot;Early in the year
1861,&quot; says his biographer, &quot;a triumvirate of Republicans assumed to
designate candidates for the offices which President Lincoln was about
to fill in the Oneida district. To accomplish this end they went to
Washington and called upon their representative, handing him a list of
candidates to endorse for appointment. Mr. Conkling read it carefully,
and, seeing that it contained undesirable names, he replied:
'Gentlemen, when I need your assistance in making the appointments in
our district, I shall let you know.' This retort, regarded by some of
his friends as indiscreet, was the seed that years afterward ripened
into an unfortunate division of the Republican party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>If Seward was more tactful than Conkling in the dispensa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.390" id="Page_ii.390">ii. 390</a></span>tion of
patronage, he was not less vigilant and tenacious. Almost immediately
after inauguration it became apparent that differences relative to
local appointments existed between him and Ira Harris, the newly
elected New York senator. Harris' tall and powerful form,
distinguished by a broad and benevolent face, was not more marked than
the reputation that preceded him as a profound and fearless judge. At
the Albany bar he had been the associate of Marcus T. Reynolds, Samuel
Stevens, Nicholas Hill, and the venerable Daniel Cady, and if he did
not possess the wit of Reynolds or the eloquence of Cady, the
indomitable energy of Stevens and the mental vigour of Nicholas Hill
were his, making conspicuous his achievements in the pursuit of truth
and justice. His transfer to the Senate at the age of fifty-eight and
his appointment upon the judiciary and foreign relations committees,
presented a new opportunity to exhibit his deep and fruitful interest
in public affairs, and, as the friend of Senators Collamer of Vermont
and Sumner of Massachusetts, he was destined to have an influential
share in the vital legislation of the war period.</p>

<p>Harris took little interest in the distribution of patronage, or in
questions of party politics that quicken local strife, but he insisted
upon a fair recognition of his friends, and to adjust their
differences Seward arranged an evening conference to which the
President was invited. At this meeting the discussion took a broad
range. The secretary of state had prepared a list covering the
important offices in New York, but before he could present it,
Lincoln, with the ready intuitions of a shrewd politician, remarked
that he reserved to himself the privilege of appointing Hiram Barney
collector of the port of New York. This announcement did not surprise
Seward, for, at the conclusion of Weed's visit to Springfield in the
preceding December, Lincoln reminded the journalist that he had said
nothing about appointments. &quot;Some gentlemen who have been quite
nervous about the object of your visit here,&quot; said the
President-elect, &quot;would be surprised, if not incredulous, were I to
tell them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.391" id="Page_ii.391">ii. 391</a></span> during the two days we have passed together you have
made no application, suggestion, or allusion to political
appointments.&quot;</p>

<p>To this the shrewd manager, willing to wait until Seward's appointment
and confirmation as secretary of state had placed him in a position to
direct rather than to beg patronage, replied that nothing of that
nature had been upon his mind, since he was much more concerned about
the welfare of the country. &quot;This,&quot; said Lincoln, &quot;is undoubtedly a
proper view of the question, and yet so much were you misunderstood
that I have received telegrams from prominent Republicans warning me
against your efforts to forestall important appointments in your
State. Other gentlemen who have visited me since the election have
expressed similar apprehensions.&quot; The President, thus cunningly
leading up to what was on his mind, said further that it was
particularly pleasant to him to reflect that he was coming into office
unembarrassed by promises. &quot;I have not,&quot; said he, &quot;promised an office
to any man, nor have I, but in a single instance, mentally committed
myself to an appointment; and as that relates to an important office
in your State, I have concluded to mention it to you&#8212;under strict
injunctions of secrecy, however. If I am not induced by public
considerations to change my purpose, Hiram Barney will be collector of
the port of New York.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>To Weed, Barney's name aroused no agreeable memories. At the formation
of the Republican party he had found it easier to affiliate with
Lucius Robinson and David Dudley Field than to act in accord with the
Whig leader, and the result at Chicago had emphasised this
independence. Too politic, however, to antagonise the appointment, and
too wary to indorse it, Weed replied that prior to the Chicago
convention he had known Barney very slightly, but that, if what he had
learned of him since was true, Barney was entitled to any office he
asked for. &quot;He has not asked for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.392" id="Page_ii.392">ii. 392</a></span> or any other office,&quot; said
Lincoln, quickly; &quot;nor does he know of my intention.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>If the President-elect failed to draw out the adroit New Yorker, he
had tactfully given notice of his intention not to be controlled by
him. A political boss, outside his own State, usually bears the
reputation that home opponents give him, and, although Weed was never
so bad as painted by his adversaries, he had long been a chief with an
odious notoriety. Apparently disinterested, and always refusing to
seek or to accept office himself, he loved power, and for years,
whenever Whig or Republican party was ascendant in New York, his
ambition to prescribe its policy, direct its movements, and dictate
the men who might hold office, had been discreetly but imperiously
exercised, until his influence was viewed with abhorrence by many and
with distrust by the country.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> It is doubtful if Lincoln's opinion
corresponded with the accepted one,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> but his desire to have some
avenue of informa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.393" id="Page_ii.393">ii. 393</a></span>tion respecting New York affairs opened to him other
than through the Weed machine, made the President bold to declare his
independence at the outset.</p>

<p>The immediate influence that led to the announcement of Barney's
selection, however, is not entirely clear. At the Cooper Institute
meeting in February, 1860, at which Lincoln spoke, Barney occupied a
seat on the stage, and was among the few gentlemen having opportunity
to pay the distinguished Illinoisan those courtesies which especially
please one who felt, as Lincoln did &quot;by reason of his own modest
estimate of himself,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> that he was under obligation to any person
showing him marked attention. But neither this fact nor Barney's
subsequent support at Chicago sufficiently accounts for the strong
preference indicated by such an important and far-reaching
appointment. Among the few indorsements on file in the treasury
department at Washington, one letter, dated March 8, 1861, and
addressed to Salmon P. Chase, speaks of Barney as &quot;a personal friend
of yours.&quot; Six days later a New York newspaper announced that &quot;the
appointment of Barney has been a fixed fact ever since Chase went into
the Cabinet. It was this influence that persuaded Chase to accept the
position.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The biographer of Thurlow Weed, probably basing the
statement upon the belief of Weed himself, states, without
qualification, that &quot;Barney was appointed through the influence of
Secretary Chase.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> This may, in part, account for Weed's and
Seward's bitter hostility to the Ohioan's becoming a member of the
Cabinet; for, if Chase, before his appointment as secretary of the
treasury, had sufficient influence to control the principal federal
office in New York, what, might they not have asked, would be the
measure of this influence after the development of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.394" id="Page_ii.394">ii. 394</a></span> great ability
as a financier has made him necessary to the President as well as to
the country?</p>

<p>Inquiry, however, as to the one first suggesting Barney's name to
Lincoln does not lead to the open. Chase's entrance into the Cabinet
being settled, his influence firmly sustained Barney, but, before
that, very early after the election, between November 7 and Weed's
visit to Springfield on December 17, some one spoke the word in
Barney's behalf which left such a deep and lasting impression upon the
President's mind that he determined to advise Weed, before Seward
could accept the state portfolio, of his intention to appoint Barney
collector of the port of New York. The name of the person exerting
such an influence, however, is now unknown. During this period Chase
neither saw the President-elect, nor, so far as the records show,
wrote him more than a formal note of congratulations. Another possible
avenue of communication may have been Bryant or Greeley, but the
latter distinctly denied that he asked, or wanted, or manipulated the
appointment of any one.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Bryant, who had great influence with
Lincoln,<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and who strongly opposed Seward's going into the
Cabinet,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> had presided at the Cooper Institute meeting and sat
beside Hiram Barney. He knew that such a man, placed at the head of
the custom-house and wielding its vast patronage, could be a potent
factor in breaking Weed's control, but the editor's only published
letter to Lincoln during this period was confined to reasons for
making Chase secretary of state. In it he did not deprecate the
strengthening of the Weed machine which would probably ignore the
original New York supporters of Lincoln, or in any wise refer to local
matters. Bryant had been partial to Chase for President until after
Lincoln's Cooper Institute speech, and now, after election, he thought
Chase, as secre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.395" id="Page_ii.395">ii. 395</a></span>tary of state, would be best for the country.
Lincoln's reply of &quot;a few lines,&quot; convincing his correspondent &quot;that
whatever selection you make it will be made conscientiously,&quot;
contained no word about Barney. Other letters, or parties personally
interested in Barney, may have passed between the President-elect and
Bryant, or Chase. Indeed, Lincoln confessed to Weed that he had
received telegrams and visits from prominent Republicans, warning him
against the Albany editor's efforts to forestall important state
appointments, but no clue is left to identify them. The mystery
deepens, too, since, whatever was done, came without Barney's
suggestion or knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>Hiram Barney, a native of Jefferson County, a graduate of Union
College in 1834, and the head of a well-known law firm, was a lawyer
of high character and a Republican of Democratic antecedents, who had
stood with Greeley and Bryant in opposing Seward at Chicago, and whose
appointment to the most important federal office in the State meant
mischief for Weed.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> In its effect it was not unlike President
Garfield's selection of William H. Robertson for the same place; and,
although it did not at once result so disastrously to Weed as
Robertson's appointment did to Conkling twenty years later, it gave
the editor's adversaries vantage ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.396" id="Page_ii.396">ii. 396</a></span> which so seriously crippled
the Weed machine, that, in the succeeding November, George Opdyke, a
personal enemy of Thurlow Weed,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> was nominated and elected mayor
of New York City.</p>

<p>At the conference of the President and New York senators, Seward,
accepting the inevitable, received Lincoln's announcement of Barney's
appointment in chilling silence. Without openly disclosing itself, the
proposed step had been the cause of much friction, and was yet to be
opposed with coolness and candour,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> but Lincoln's firmness in
declaring that Barney was a man of integrity who had his confidence,
and that he had made the appointment on his own responsibility and
from personal knowledge,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> impressed his hearers with the belief
that, with whatever disfavour Seward listened, he had practically
surrendered to the will of his superior. Another scene occurred, as
the interview proceeded, which also indicated the master spirit. After
reviewing the extended list of names presented for collectors and
other officers, Seward expressed the wish that the nominations might
be sent forthwith to the Senate. The embarrassed senators, unprepared
for such haste, found in the secretary of the navy, who had
accompanied the President on the latter's invitation, a ready opponent
to such a plan because other members of the Cabinet had been wholly
ignored. Welles inquired if the secretary of the treasury and
attorney-general had been consulted, insisting that a proper
administration of the departments made their concurrence in the
selection of competent subordinates upon whom they must rely, not only
proper but absolutely necessary. Seward objected to this as
unnecessary, for these were New York appointments, he said, and he
knew better than Chase and Bates what was best in that State for the
party and the Administration. The President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.397" id="Page_ii.397">ii. 397</a></span> however, agreed with the
secretary of the navy, declaring that nothing conclusive would be done
until he had advised with interested heads of departments. &quot;With
this,&quot; says Welles, &quot;the meeting soon and somewhat abruptly
terminated.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> So far as it related to the distribution of
patronage, this conference, held early in March, settled nothing
beyond Barney's appointment; as to the question whether Seward was
President or Premier, however, the New Yorker soon learned that he was
to have influence with his chief only by reason of his assiduous
attention to the public business and his dexterity and tact in
promoting the views of the President.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>To the outsider, the appointment of Barney looked, for the moment,
like a substantial defeat for Seward. &quot;The mighty struggle,&quot; said the
<i>Herald</i>, &quot;is for the possession of the New York appointments, and the
strife is deadly and bitter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The anti-Weed forces, reinforced by
the arrival of Greeley,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> the coming of Barney,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and the
persistence of Harris,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> were elated over reported changes in the
Weed slate, believing the fruit of their long labours was about to
come at last, but from the sum-total of the nominations, made day by
day, it appeared that while several attach&#233;s of the <i>Tribune's</i> staff
had been recognised,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Seward had secured all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.398" id="Page_ii.398">ii. 398</a></span> the important
offices save collector of the port.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> During this turmoil the
Secretary's unfailing calmness was not disturbed, nor his uniform
courtesy ruffled.</p>

<p>Seward never forgot a real friend. Out of thirty-five diplomatic posts
carrying a salary of five thousand dollars and upward, the Empire
State was credited with nine; and, of these, one, a minister
plenipotentiary, received twelve thousand dollars, and seven ministers
resident, seventy-five hundred each. Seward, with the advice of
Thurlow Weed, filled them all with tried and true supporters. Greeley,
who, for some time, had been murmuring about the Secretary's
appointments, let fly, at last, a sarcastic paragraph or two about the
appointment of Andrew B. Dickinson, the farmer statesman of Steuben,
which betrayed something of the bitterness existing between the
Secretary of State and the editor of the <i>Tribune</i>. For more than a
year no such thing had existed as personal relations. Before the
spring of 1860 they met frequently with a show of cordiality, and,
although the former understood that the latter boasted an independence
of control whenever they differed in opinion, the <i>Tribune</i>
co-operated and its editor freely conferred with the New York senator
during the long struggle in Congress for Kansas and free labour; but
after Seward's defeat at Chicago they never met,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> dislike
displaced regard, and the <i>Tribune</i>, with eye and ear open to catch
whatever would make its adversary wince, indulged in bitter sarcasm.
William B. Taylor's reappointment as postmaster at New York City gave
it opportunity to praise Taylor and criticise Seward, claiming that
the former, who had held office under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.399" id="Page_ii.399">ii. 399</a></span> Buchanan, though an excellent
official, was not a Republican. This proved so deep a thrust, arraying
office-seekers and their friends against the Secretary and Thurlow
Weed, that Greeley kept it up, finding some appointees inefficient,
and the Republicanism of others insufficient.</p>

<p>To the former class belonged the minister resident to Nicaragua.
Dickinson had wearied of a farmer's life,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and Seward, who often
benefited by his ardent and influential friendship, bade him make his
own selection from the good things he had to offer. More than ordinary
reasons existed why the Secretary desired to assist the Steuben
farmer. Dickinson served in the State Senate throughout Seward's two
terms as governor, and during these four years he had fearlessly and
faithfully explained and defended Seward's recommendation of a
division of the school fund, which proved so offensive to many
thousand voters in New York. Indeed, it may be said with truth, that
Seward's record on that one question did more to defeat him at Chicago
than all his &quot;irrepressible conflict&quot; and &quot;higher-law&quot; declarations.
It became the fulcrum of Curtin's and Lane's aggressive resistance,
who claimed that, in the event of his nomination, the American or
Know-Nothing element in Pennsylvania and Indiana would not only
maintain its organisation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.400" id="Page_ii.400">ii. 400</a></span> largely increase its strength, because
of its strong prejudices against a division of the school fund.</p>

<p>Dickinson met this issue squarely. He followed the powerful
Pennsylvanian and Indianian from delegation to delegation, explaining
that Seward had sought simply to turn the children of poor foreigners
into the path of moral and intellectual cultivation pursued by the
American born,&#8212;a policy, he declared, in which all Republicans and
Christian citizens should concur. He pictured school conditions in New
York City in 1840, the date of Seward's historic message; he showed
how prejudices arising from differences of language and religion kept
schoolhouses empty and slum children ignorant, while reform schools
and prisons were full. Under these circumstances, thundered the
Steuben farmer, Seward did right in recommending the establishment of
schools in which such children might be instructed by teachers
speaking the same language with themselves, and professing the same
faith.</p>

<p>This was the sort of defence Seward appreciated. His recommendation
had not been the result of carelessness or inadvertence, and, although
well-meaning friends sought to excuse it as such, he resented the
insinuation. &quot;I am only determined the more,&quot; he wrote, &quot;to do what
may be in my power to render our system of education as comprehensive
as the interests involved, and to provide for the support of the
glorious superstructure of universal suffrage,&#8212;the basis of universal
education.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> In his defence, Dickinson maintained the excellence
of Seward's suggestion, and it deeply angered the Steuben farmer that
the <i>Tribune's</i> editor, who knew the facts as well as he, did not also
attempt to silence the arguments of the two most influential Lincoln
delegates, who boldly based their opposition, not upon personal
hostility or his advanced position in Republican faith, but upon what
Greeley had known for twenty years to be a perversion of Seward's
language and Seward's motives.</p>

<p>In the Secretary's opinion Dickinson's bold defiance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.401" id="Page_ii.401">ii. 401</a></span> the rules of
grammar and spelling did not weaken his natural intellectual strength;
but Greeley, whom the would-be diplomat, with profane vituperation,
had charged at Chicago with the basest ingratitude,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> protested
against such an appointment to such an important post. &quot;We have long
known him,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;as a skilful farmer, a cunning
politician, and a hearty admirer of Mr. Seward, but never suspected
him of that intimate knowledge of the Spanish language which is almost
indispensable to that country, which, just at this moment, from the
peculiar designs of the Southern rebels, is one of the most important
that the secretary of state has to fill.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Dickinson recognised
the odium that would attach to Seward because of the appointment, and
in a characteristic letter he assured the Secretary of State that,
whatever Greeley might say, he need have no fear of his ability to
represent the government efficiently at the court of Nicaragua.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>James S. Pike's selection for minister resident to The Hague seemed to
contradict Greeley's declaration that he neither asked nor desired the
appointment of any one. For years Pike, &quot;a skilful maligner of Mr.
Seward,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> had been the Washington representative of the <i>Tribune</i>,
and the belief generally obtained that, although Pike belonged to
Maine and was supported by its delegation in Congress, the real power
behind the throne lived in New York. Nevertheless, the <i>Tribune's</i>
editor, drifting in thought and speech in the inevitable direction of
his genius, soon indicated that he had had no personal favours to ask.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.402" id="Page_ii.402">ii. 402</a></span></p>
<p>Seward's appointment as secretary of state chilled Greeley's love for
the new Administration.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The <i>Tribune's</i> editor seems never to
have shown an exalted appreciation of Abraham Lincoln. Although they
served together in Congress, and, for twenty years, had held to the
same political faith, Greeley, apparently indifferent to his
colleague's success, advocated, in 1858, the return of Stephen A.
Douglas to the United States Senate, because of his hostility to the
Lecompton policy of the Buchanan administration, and it was intimated
that this support, backed by his powerful journal, may have resulted
in Douglas' carrying the Legislature against Lincoln. In 1860, Greeley
favoured Bates for President. He was not displeased to have Lincoln
nominated, but his battle had been to defeat Seward, and when Lincoln
turned to Seward for secretary of state, which meant, as Greeley
believed, the domination of the Weed machine to punish his revolt
against Seward, Greeley became irretrievably embittered against the
President.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if Lincoln and Greeley, under any circumstances, could
have had close personal relations. Lack of sympathy because they did
not see things alike must have kept them apart; but Seward's presence
in the Cabinet undoubtedly limited Greeley's intercourse with the
President at a time when frequent conferences might have avoided grave
embarrassments. His virile and brilliant talents, which turned him
into an independent and acute thinker on a wide range of subjects,
always interested his readers, giving expression to the thoughts of
many earnest men who aided in forming public opinion in their
neighbourhoods, so that it may be said with truth, that, in 1860 and
1861, everything he wrote was eagerly read and discussed in the North.
&quot;Notwithstanding the loyal support given Lincoln throughout the
country,&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii.403" id="Page_ii.403">ii. 403</a></span> says McClure, &quot;Greeley was in closer touch with the active,
loyal sentiment of the people than even the President himself.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
His art of saying things on paper seemed to thrill people as much as
the nervous, spirited rhetoric of an intense talker. With the air of
lofty detachment from sordid interests, his sentences, clear and
rapid, read like the clarion notes of a peroration, and impressed his
great audiences with an earnestness that often carried conviction even
to unwilling listeners.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Tribune's</i> columns did not manifest toward the
Administration a fine exhibition of the love of fair play. In the
hottest moment of excitement growing out of hostilities, it
patriotically supported the most vigorous prosecution of the war, and
mercilessly criticised its opponents; but Greeley would neither
conform to nor silently endure Lincoln's judgment, and, as every step
in the war created new issues, his constant criticism, made through
the columns of a great newspaper, kept the party more or less
seriously divided, until, by untimely forcing emancipation, he
inspired, despite the patient and conciliatory methods of Lincoln, a
factious hostility to the President which embarrassed his efforts to
marshal a solid North in support of his war policy. Greeley was a man
of clean hands and pure heart, and, at the outset, it is probable that
his attempted direction of Lincoln's policy existed without
ill-feeling; yet he was a good hater, and, as the contest went on, he
drifted into an opposition which gradually increased in bitterness,
and, finally, led to a temporary and foolish rebellion against the
President's renomination. Meantime, the great-hearted Lincoln, conning
the lesson taught by the voice of history, continued to practise the
precept,</p>

northern New York. He suddenly stopped the carriage, and, looking
around for a few minutes, said: 'We are now on some of my poor land,
familiarly known as the John Brown tract;' and he then added, 'I own
eight hundred thousand acres, of which this is a part, and all in one
piece.' Everybody knows that his father purchased the most of it at
sales by the comptrollers of state for unpaid taxes. He said he owned
land in fifty-six of the sixty counties in New York. He was also a

there was really a substantial majority against it, a tie was
skilfully arranged to compel Van Buren, as Vice President, to give the
casting vote. White, the Southern Democratic candidate so seriously
menacing him, was in the Senate, and voted for the bill. Van Buren
must, it was supposed, offend the pro-slavery men by voting against
the bill, or offend the North and perhaps bruise his conscience by
voting for it. When the roll was being called, Van Buren, so Benton
tells us, was out of the chair, walking behind the colonnade at the
rear of the Vice President's seat. Calhoun, fearful lest he might
escape the ordeal, eagerly asked where he was, and told the
sergeant-at-arms to look for him. But Van Buren was ready, and at once
stepped to his chair and voted for the bill. His close friend, Silas
Wright of New York, also voted for it. Benton says he deemed both the
votes to be political and given from policy. So they probably were....
Van Buren never deserved to be called a 'Northern man with Southern
principles.' But this vote came nearer to an excuse for the epithet
than did any other act of his career.&quot;&#8212;Edward M. Shepard, <i>Life of

to his faults. His natural instincts were humane and progressive. He
hated slavery and all its belongings, though a seeming necessity
constrained him to write, in 1838, to this intensely pro-slavery city,
a pro-slavery letter, which was at war with his real, or at least with
his subsequent convictions. Though of Democratic parentage, he had
been an Adams man, an anti-Mason, and was now thoroughly a Whig. The
policy of more extensive and vigorous internal improvement had no more
zealous champion. By nature, genial and averse to pomp, ceremony, and
formality, few public men of his early prime were better calculated to
attract and fascinate young men of his own party, and holding views
accordant on most points with his.... Weed was of coarser mould and
fibre than Seward&#8212;tall, robust, dark-featured, shrewd, resolute, and
not over-scrupulous&#8212;keen-sighted, though not far-seeing.&quot;&#8212;Horace

displayed in bold relief. His natural tendencies were toward a
government not merely paternal, but prodigal&#8212;one which, in its
multiform endeavours to make every one prosperous, if not rich, was
very likely to whelm all in general embarrassment, if not in general
bankruptcy. Few governors have favoured, few senators voted for more
unwisely lavish expenditures than he. Above the suspicion of voting
money into his own pocket, he has a rooted dislike to opposing a
project or bill whereby any of his attached friends are to profit.

the chamber grew murky. One morning a tallish man, past middle age,
with iron-gray locks drooping on his shoulders, and wearing a mixed
suit of plain clothes, took the floor. I noticed that pens,
newspapers, and all else were laid down, and every eye fixed on the
speaker. I supposed he was some quaint old joker from the backwoods,
who was going to afford the House a little fun. The first sentences
arrested my attention. A beam of light shot through the darkness, and
I began to get glimpses of the question at issue. Soon a broad belt of
sunshine spread over the chamber. 'Who is he?' I asked a member.
'Michael Hoffman,' was the reply. He spoke for an hour, and though his

lucid in his argument that, where all had appeared confused before,

&quot;The real contest took place over the adoption of the rule requiring a
two-thirds vote for the nomination. For it was through this rule that
enough Southern members, chosen before Van Buren's letter, were to
escape obedience to their instructions to vote for him. Robert J.
Walker, then a senator from Mississippi, a man of interesting history
and large ability, led the Southerners. He quoted the precedent of
1832 when Van Buren had been nominated for the Vice Presidency under
the two-thirds rule, and that of 1835, when he had been nominated for
the Presidency. These nominations had led to victory. In 1840 the rule
had not been adopted. Without this rule, he said amid angry
excitement, the party would yield to those whose motto seemed to be
'rule or ruin.' Butler, Daniel S. Dickinson, and Marcus Morton led the
Northern ranks.... Morton said that under the majority rule Jefferson
had been nominated; that rule had governed state, county, and township
conventions. Butler admitted that under the rule Van Buren would not
be nominated, although a majority of the convention was known to be
for him. In 1832 and 1835 the two-thirds rule had prevailed because it
was certainly known who would be nominated; and the rule operated to
aid not to defeat the majority. If the rule were adopted, it would be
by the votes of States which were not Democratic, and would bring
'dismemberment and final breaking up of the party.' Walker laughed at
Butler's 'tall vaulting' from the floor; and, refusing to shrink from
the Van Buren issue, he protested against New York dictation, and
warningly said that, if Van Buren were nominated, Clay would be
elected.&quot;&#8212;Edward M. Shepard, <i>Life of Martin Van Buren</i>, p. 408.</p></div>

political life; dignified, powerful, respected, it was the pride of
the nation, and one of its main bulwarks. The height of ordinary
ambition was satisfied by attainment to that place; and men once
securely seated there would have been content to hold it on and on,
asking no more. One cannot doubt the sincerity of the expressions in

&quot;Wright was a strong man the day before his nomination for governor.
He fell far, and if left alone will be not, what he might have been,
George I. to William of Orange, lineal heir to Jackson, through Van
Buren. The wiseacres in New York speak of him with compliment, 'this
distinguished statesman;' yet they bring all their small artillery to

&quot;I think you cannot leave the <i>Journal</i> without giving up the whole
army to dissension and overthrow. I agree that if, by remaining, you
save it, you only draw down double denunciation upon yourself and me.
Nor do I see the way through and beyond that. But there will be some
way through. I grant, then, that, for yourself and me, it is wise and
profitable that you leave. I must be left without the possibility of
restoration, without a defender, without an organ. Nothing else will
satisfy those who think they are shaded. Then, and not until then,
shall I have passed through the not unreasonable punishment for too
much success. But the party&#8212;the country? They cannot bear your
withdrawal. I think I am not mistaken in this. Let us adhere, then.
Stand fast. It is neither wise nor reasonable that we should bear the
censure of defeat, when we have been deprived of not merely command,
but of a voice in council.&quot;&#8212;W.H. Seward to Thurlow Weed, <i>Ibid.</i>,

&quot;More serious than either of these [Anti-Rent disturbance and veto of
canal appropriation] was the harm done by the quiet yet persistent
opposition of the Hunkers. Nor can it be doubted that the influence of
the Government at Washington was thrown against him in that critical
hour. Governor Marcy was secretary of war; Samuel Nelson had just been
appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States;
Governor Bouck held one of the most influential offices in the city of
New York&#8212;all these were members of that section of the party with
which Governor Wright was not in sympathy. It was evident that he
would not be able to maintain himself against an opposition of which
the elements were so numerous, so varied, and so dangerous.&quot;&#8212;Morgan

setting an example of industry and zeal. His house was the shrine of
many a pilgrimage; and, as profound regret at the loss of such a man
from the councils of the State took the place of a less honourable

state convention, held in Syracuse. The great chiefs of both factions
were on the ground, and never was there a fiercer, more bitter and
relentless conflict between the Narragansetts and Pequods than this
memorable contest between the Barnburners and Hunkers. Silas Wright
was the idol of the Barnburners. He had died on the 27th of the
preceding August&#8212;less than two weeks before. James S. Wadsworth
voiced the sentiments of his followers. In the convention some one
spoke of doing justice to Mr. Wright. A Hunker sneeringly responded,
'It is too late; he is dead.' Springing upon a table Wadsworth made
the hall ring as he uttered the defiant reply: 'Though it may be too
late to do justice to Silas Wright, it is not too late to do justice
to his assassins.' The Hunkers laid the Wilmot Proviso upon the table,
but the Barnburners punished them at the election.&quot;&#8212;H.B. Stanton,

an argumentative and deliberate method of address that befitted the
bar and the Senate. Few knew how able a lawyer the elder Van Buren
was. The son was enthusiastic, frank, bold, and given to wit,
repartee, and a style of oratory admirably adapted to swaying popular
assemblies. The younger Van Buren, too, was a sound lawyer.&quot;&#8212;H.B.

&quot;It will be remembered that Van Buren, in his inaugural as President,
pledged himself to veto any bill for the abolition of slavery in the
District of Columbia, unless sanctioned by Maryland and Virginia.
Anti-slavery men took great umbrage to this pledge, and while Butler
at the Buffalo convention was graphically describing how the
ex-President, now absorbed in bucolic pursuits at his Kinderhook farm,
had recently leaped a fence to show his visitor a field of sprouting
turnips, one of these disgusted Abolitionists abruptly exclaimed,
'Damn his turnips! What are his present opinions about the abolition
of slavery in the District of Columbia?' 'I was just coming to that
subject,' responded the oily Barnburner, with a suave bow towards the
ruffled Whig. 'Well, you can't be a moment too quick in coming to it,'

the difficulty of bringing about a reconciliation. But that he, a
Democrat of the old school, should find himself associated with
gentlemen of the Whig party, from whom he differed on almost every
point, was a painful and distressing surprise. He was willing, if it
must be so, to go with his own section of the Democratic party, though
deeming their course not the wisest. But when it came to an alliance
with Whigs and Abolitionists he lost all heart in the movement. This
accounts for his strong expressions in after years to justify himself
from the charge of being an Abolitionist and false to his old
faith.&quot;&#8212;Morgan Dix, <i>Memoirs of John A. Dix</i>, Vol. 1, p. 239.</p></div>

when the day for electing a United States senator arrived, sixteen
Whigs voted for Fish, and fifteen Democrats voted for as many
different candidates, so that the Fish Whigs could not double over
upon them. James W. Beekman, a Whig senator of New York City, who
claimed that Fish had fallen too much under the control of Weed, voted
for Francis Granger. Upon a motion to adjourn, Beekman voted 'yes'
with the Democrats, creating a tie, which the lieutenant-governor
broke by also voting in the affirmative. The Whigs then waited for a

they sprung a resolution to go into an election, and, after an

Marcy in that direction. Seymour pushed forward, while Marcy hung
back. Seymour rather liked the Barnburners, except John Van Buren, of
whom he was quite jealous and somewhat afraid. But Marcy, after the
experiences of 1847 and 1848, denounced them in hard terms, until
Seymour and the Free-soil Democrats began talking of him for President
in 1852, when the wily old Regency tactician mellowed toward them.
Nothing was wanted to carry Marcy clear over except the hostility of
Dickinson, who stood in his way to the White House. This he soon
encountered, which reconciled him to the Barnburners.&quot;&#8212;H.B. Stanton,

seem as if the course of the opposition were plain. That the different
elements of opposition should be fused into one complete whole seemed
political wisdom. That course involved the formation of a new party
and was urged warmly and persistently by many newspapers, but by none
with such telling influence as by the New York <i>Tribune</i>. It had
likewise the countenance of Chase, Sumner, and Wade. There were three
elements that must be united&#8212;the Whigs, the Free-soilers, and the
Anti-Nebraska Democrats. The Whigs were the most numerous body and as
those at the North, to a man, had opposed the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise they thought, with some quality of reason, that the fight
might well be made under their banner and with their name. For the
organisation of a party was not the work of a day. Why, then, go to
all this trouble, when a complete organisation is at hand ready for
use? This view of the situation was ably argued by the New York
<i>Times</i>, and was supported by Senator Seward. As the New York Senator
had a position of influence superior to any one who had opposed the
Kansas-Nebraska bill, strenuous efforts were made to get his adhesion
to a new party movement, but they were without avail. 'Seward hangs
fire,' wrote Dr. Bailey. 'He agrees with Thurlow Weed.'&#8212;(Bailey to
J.S. Pike, May 30, 1854, <i>First Blows of the Civil War</i>, p. 237.) 'We
are not yet ready for a great national convention at Buffalo or
elsewhere,' wrote Seward to Theodore Parker; 'it would bring together
only the old veterans. The States are the places for activity just
now.'&#8212;(<i>Life of Seward</i>, Vol. 2, p. 232.) Yet many Whigs who were not
devoted to machine politics saw clearly that a new party must be
formed under a new name. They differed, however, in regard to their
bond of union. Some wished to go to the country with simply <i>Repeal of
the Kansas-Nebraska act</i> inscribed on their banner. Others wished to
plant themselves squarely on prohibition of slavery in all the
territories. Still others preferred the resolve that not another slave
State should be admitted into the Union. Yet after all, the time
seemed ripe for the formation of a party whose cardinal principle
might be summed up as opposition to the extension of slavery.&quot;&#8212;James
F. Rhodes, <i>History of the United States</i>, Vol. 2, p. 45-7.</p></div>

&quot;Mr. Greeley called upon me at the Astor House and asked if I did not
think that the time and circumstances were favourable to his
nomination. I replied that I did not think the time and circumstances
favourable to his election, if nominated, but that my friends had lost
control of the state convention. This answer perplexed him, but a few
words of explanation made it quite clear. Admitting that he had
brought the people up to the point of accepting a temperance candidate
for governor, I remarked that another aspirant had 'stolen his
thunder.' In other words, while he had shaken the temperance bush,
Myron H. Clark would catch the bird. I informed Mr. Greeley that
Know-Nothing or 'Choctaw' lodges had been secretly organised
throughout the State, by means of which many delegates for Mr. Clark
had been secured. Mr. Greeley saw that the 'slate' had been broken,
and cheerfully relinquished the idea of being nominated. But a few
days afterwards Mr. Greeley came to Albany, and said in an abrupt but
not unfriendly way, 'Is there any objection to my running for
lieutenant-governor?'... After a little more conversation, Mr. Greeley
became entirely satisfied that a nomination for lieutenant-governor
was not desirable, and left me in good spirits.&quot;&#8212;<i>Ibid.</i>, Vol. 2, p.

position, the ability and the character necessary for the leadership
of a new party. He was the idol of the anti-slavery Whigs.... Perhaps
his sympathies were heartily enlisted in the movement for a new party
and he was held back by Thurlow Weed. Perhaps he would have felt less
trammelled had not his senatorship been at stake in the fall election.
The fact is, however, that the Republican movement in the West and New
England received no word of encouragement from him. He did not make a
speech, even in the State of New York, during the campaign. His care
and attention were engrossed in seeing that members of the Legislature
were elected who would vote for him for senator.&quot; On July 27, 1854,
the New York <i>Independent</i> asked: &quot;Shall we have a new party? The
leaders for such a party do not appear. Seward adheres to the Whig
party.&quot; In the New York <i>Tribune</i> of November 9, Greeley asserted that
&quot;the man who should have impelled and guided the general uprising of
the free States is W.H. Seward.&quot;</p></div>

birth. In early youth he became a cigarmaker, then a tobacco dealer,
and later a grocer. At Harrisburg, his first introduction to politics
resulted in a fist-fight with a state senator who was still on the
floor when Wood left the bar-room. Then he went to New York, and, in
1840, was elected to Congress at the age of twenty-eight. Wood had a
fascinating personality. He was tall and shapely, his handsome
features and keen blue eyes were made the more attractive by an
abundance of light hair which fell carelessly over a high, broad
forehead. But, as a politician, he was as false as his capacity would
allow him to be, having no hesitation, either from principle or fear,
to say or do anything that served his purpose. He has been called the
successor of Aaron Burr and the predecessor of William M. Tweed. In
1858, he organised Mozart Hall, a Democratic society opposed to
Tammany.</p></div>

effect. &quot;Another tie which has heretofore held our country together
has been disbanded, and from its ruins has sprung a political
organisation trusting for its success to sectional prejudices. It
excludes from its councils the people of nearly one-half of the Union;
it seeks a triumph over one-half our country. The battle-fields of
Yorktown, of Camden, of New Orleans, are unrepresented in their
conventions; and no delegates speak for the States where rest the
remains of Washington, Jefferson, Marion, Sumter, or Morgan, or of the
later hero, Jackson. They cherish more bitter hatred of their own
countrymen than they have ever shown towards the enemies of our land.
If the language they hold this day had been used eighty years since,
we should not have thrown off the British yoke; our national
constitution would not have been formed; and if their spirit of hatred
continues, our Constitution and Government will cease to
exist.&quot;&#8212;Seymour at Springfield, Mass., July 4, 1856. Cook and Knox,

&quot;Few speeches from the stump have attracted so great attention or
exerted so great an influence. The eminence of the man combined with
the startling character of the doctrine to make it engross the public
mind. Republicans looked upon the doctrine announced as the
well-weighed conclusion of a profound thinker and of a man of wide
experience, who united the political philosopher with the practical
politician. It is not probable that Lincoln's 'house divided against
itself' speech had any influence in bringing Seward to this position.
He would at this time have scorned the notion of borrowing ideas from
Lincoln; and had he studied the progress of the Illinois canvass, he
must have seen that the declaration did not meet with general favour.
In February of this year there had been bodied forth in Seward the
politician. Now, a far-seeing statesman spoke. One was compared to
Webster's 7th-of-March speech,&#8212;the other was commended by the
Abolitionists.&quot;&#8212;James F. Rhodes, <i>History of the United States</i>, Vol.

friend of Mr. Weed, met Mr. Seward in Washington, and reiterated his
fears in connection with the accumulation of candidates. 'Mr. Lincoln
was brought to New York to divide your strength,' he said. But Mr.
Seward was not disconcerted by these warnings. Less than a fortnight
afterwards Mr. Wood was at the Astor House, where he again met Mr.
Weed and Mr. Seward. Sunday afternoon Mr. Greeley visited the hotel
and passing through one of the corridors met Mr. Wood, with whom he
began conversation. 'We shan't nominate Seward,' said Mr. Greeley,
'we'll take some more conservative man, like Pitt Fessenden or Bates.'
Immediately afterwards Mr. Wood went to Mr. Seward's room. 'Greeley
has just been here with Weed,' said Mr. Seward. 'Weed brought him up
here. You were wrong in what you said to me at Washington about
Greeley; he is all right.' 'No, I was not wrong,' insisted Mr. Wood.
'Greeley is cheating you. He will go to Chicago and work against you.'

sometimes gets a little the better of your judgment.'&quot;&#8212;Thurlow Weed

written to Mr. Seward a remarkable letter, 'dissolving the firm of
Seward, Weed &amp; Greeley,' but Mr. Weed had never seen such a letter,
nor did Mr. Greeley appear to remember its existence. Mr. Weed and Mr.
Greeley met frequently in New York, not with all of the old
cordiality, perhaps, but still they had by no means quarrelled. Mr.
Greeley wrote often to Mr. Weed, in the old way, and he and his family
were visitors at Mr. Weed's house. Indeed&#8212;though that seems
impossible&#8212;Mr. Greeley stopped at Mr. Weed's house, in Albany, on his

candidate, Cayuga County poured itself into Auburn. The streets were
full, and Mr. Seward's house and grounds overflowed with his admirers.
Flags were ready to be raised and a loaded cannon was placed at the
gate whose pillars bore up two guardian lions. Arrangements had been
perfected for the receipt of intelligence. At Mr. Seward's right hand,
just within the porch, stood his trusty henchman, Christopher Morgan.
The rider of a galloping steed dashed through the crowd with a
telegram and handed it to Seward, who passed it to Morgan. For Seward,
it read, 173&#189;; for Lincoln, 102. Morgan repeated it to the
multitude, who cheered vehemently. Then came the tidings of the second
ballot: For Seward, 184&#189;&#8212;for Lincoln, 181. 'I shall be nominated
on the next ballot,' said Seward, and the throng in the house
applauded, and those on the lawn and in the street echoed the cheers.
The next messenger lashed his horse into a run. The telegram read,
'Lincoln nominated. T.W.' Seward turned as pale as ashes. The sad
tidings crept through the vast concourse. The flags were furled, the
cannon was rolled away, and Cayuga County went home with a clouded
brow. Mr. Seward retired to rest at a late hour, and the night breeze
in the tall trees sighed a requiem over the blighted hopes of New
York's eminent son.&quot;&#8212;H.B. Stanton, <i>Random Recollections</i>, pp.

the fate of the convention in its keeping; and while it was understood
that the strength of Douglas in the delegation had been increased
during the recess by the Fowler defalcation (Fowler's substitute being
reported a Douglas man) and by the appearance of regular delegates
whose alternates had been against Douglas at Charleston, it was
obvious that the action of the politicians of New York could not be
counted upon in any direction with confidence. Rumours circulated that
a negotiation had been carried on in Washington by the New Yorkers
with the South, to sell out Douglas, the Southerners and the
Administration offering their whole strength to any man New York might
name, provided that State would slaughter Douglas. On the other hand,
it appeared that Dean Richmond, the principal manager of the New
Yorkers, had pledged himself, as solemnly as a politician could do, to
stand by the cause of Douglas to the last.&quot;&#8212;M. Halstead, <i>National

own State of such powerful leaders as Greeley, Dudley Field, Bryant,
and Wadsworth. The first two were on the ground and very busy. The two
latter sent pungent letters that were circulated among the delegates
from the various States. The main point of the attack was that Seward
could not carry New York. Soon after the adjournment of the
convention, William Curtis Noyes, a delegate, told me that a careful
canvass of the New York delegation showed that nearly one-fourth of
its members believed it was extremely doubtful if Seward could obtain
a majority at the polls in that State.&quot;&#8212;H.B. Stanton, <i>Random

was offered the War Department. This he declined, informing Mr.

&quot;When rebellion actually began many loyal Democrats came nobly out and
planted themselves by the side of the country. But those who clung to
the party organisation, what did they do? A month before Mr. Lincoln
was inaugurated they held a state convention for the Democratic party
of the State of New York. It was said it was to save the country,&#8212;it
was whispered it was to save the party. The state committee called it
and representative men gathered to attend it.... They applauded to the
echo the very blasphemy of treason, but they attempted by points of
order to silence DeWitt Clinton's son because he dared to raise his
voice for the Constitution of his country and to call rebellion by its
proper name.&quot;&#8212;Speech of Roscoe Conkling, September 26, 1862, A.R.

lighted another and put it in, then rose in great excitement and said
to Littlejohn, 'Tell the Evarts men to go right over to Harris&#8212;to

&quot;In regard to February, 1861, I need only say that I desired to avoid
giving the secession leaders the excuse and opportunity to open the
civil war before the new Administration and new Congress could be in
authority to subdue it. I conferred throughout with General Scott, and
Mr. Stanton, then in Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet. I presume I conversed
with others in a way that seemed to me best calculated to leave the
inauguration of a war to the secessionists, and to delay it, in any
case, until the new Administration should be in possession of the
Government. On the 22d of February, in concert with Mr. Stanton, I
caused the United States flag to be displayed throughout all the
northern and western portions of the United States.&quot; Letters of W.H.

Cabinet officer in Pennsylvania, who was the most conspicuous of
Curtin's foes, and on Curtin's visit to Seward as secretary of state,

&quot;In pecuniary matters Weed was generous to a fault while poor; he is
said to be less so since he became rich.... I cannot doubt, however,
that if he had never seen Wall Street or Washington, had never heard
of the Stock Board, and had lived in some yet undiscovered country,
where legislation is never bought nor sold, his life would have been
more blameless, useful, and happy. I was sitting beside him in his
editorial room soon after Governor Seward's election, when he opened a
letter from a brother Whig, which ran substantially thus: 'Dear Weed:
I want to be a bank examiner. You know how to fix it. Do so, and draw
on me for whatever sum you may see fit. Yours truly.' In an instant
his face became prematurely black with mingled rage and mortification.
'My God,' said he, 'I knew that my political adversaries thought me a
scoundrel, but I never till now supposed that my friends
did.'&quot;&#8212;Horace Greeley, <i>Recollections of a Busy Life</i>, pp. 312, 313.</p></div>

as often during the war, he met with difficulties hard to surmount. It
was Mr. Lincoln's habit at such times to telegraph Mr. Weed to come to
Washington from Albany or New York, perhaps at an hour's notice. He
often spent the day with the President, coming and returning by night,
regardless of his age and infirmities. His services in these
exigencies were often invaluable.&quot;&#8212;Thurlow Weed Barnes, <i>Life of

been given to farming, his anticipations might have been realised,
but, as it was, he experienced the fate of those who keep too many
irons in the fire. In 1839 he was elected to the State Senate, where
for four years he was able, fearless, and inflexibly honest. On one
occasion a senator from Westchester County criticised and ridiculed
Dickinson's language. Dickinson immediately rejoined, saying that
while his difficulty consisted in a want of suitable language with
which to express his ideas, his colleague was troubled with a flood of
words without any ideas to express.&quot;&#8212;Thurlow Weed Barnes, <i>Life of
