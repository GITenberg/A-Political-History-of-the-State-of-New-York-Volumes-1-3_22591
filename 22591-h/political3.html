STATE OF NEW YORK</h2>

<br />
THE UPRISING OF THE NORTH<br />
<br />
1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> politicians indecently clamoured for office, as indicated in the
concluding chapter of the preceding volume, President Lincoln,
whenever escape from the patronage hunters permitted, was considering
the wisdom of provisioning Fort Sumter. Grave doubt obtained as to the
government's physical ability to succour the fort, but, assuming it
possible, was it wise as a political measure? The majority of the
Cabinet, including Seward, voted in the negative, giving rise to the
report that Sumter would be abandoned. Union people generally, wishing
to support the brave and loyal action of Major Anderson and his little
band, vigorously protested against such an exhibition of weakness, and
the longer the Government hesitated the more vigorously the popular
will resented such a policy. Finally, on March 29, in spite of General
Scott's advice and Secretary Seward's opinion, the President, guided
by public sentiment, directed a relief expedition to be ready to sail
as early as April 6.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a Confederate constitution had been adopted, a Confederate
flag raised over the capitol at Montgomery, and a Confederate Congress
assembled, which had authorised the enlistment of 100,000 volunteers,
the issue of <span class="keep_together">$1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.2" id="Page_iii.2">iii. 2</a></span>000,000</span>
in treasury notes, and the organisation of a
navy. To take charge of military operations at Charleston, the
Confederate government commissioned Pierre T. Beauregard a
brigadier-general and placed him in command of South Carolina.</p>

<p>Beauregard quickly learned of Lincoln's decision to relieve Sumter,
and upon the Confederate authorities devolved the grave responsibility
of reducing the fort before the relief expedition arrived. In
discussing this serious question Robert Toombs, the Confederate
secretary of state, did not hesitate to declare that &quot;the firing upon
it at this time is suicide, murder, and will lose us every friend at
the North. You will wantonly strike a hornet's nest which extends from
mountain to ocean, and legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us
to death. It is unnecessary; it puts us in the wrong; it is fatal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Jefferson Davis, already overborne by pressure from
South Carolina, ordered Beauregard to demand its evacuation, and, if
refused, &quot;to reduce it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Answering Beauregard's aides, who
submitted the demand on the afternoon of April 11, Anderson refused to
withdraw, adding, &quot;if you do not batter the fort to pieces about us,
we shall be starved out in a few days.&quot;'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> To this message the
Confederate Secretary of War replied: &quot;Do not desire needlessly to
bombard Fort Sumter. If Major Anderson will state the time at which,
as indicated by him, he will evacuate, and agree in the meantime he
will not use his guns against us unless ours should be employed
against Sumter, you are authorised thus to avoid the effusion of
blood. If this or its equivalent be refused, reduce the fort as your
judgment decides to be the most practicable.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Four aides submitted
this proposition at a quarter before one o'clock on the morning of
April 12, to which Anderson, after confer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.3" id="Page_iii.3">iii. 3</a></span>ring two hours and a half
with his officers, replied, &quot;I will evacuate by noon on the 15th
instant, and I will not in the meantime open fire upon your forces
unless compelled to do so by some hostile act against this fort or the
flag of my Government, should I not receive, prior to that time,
controlling instructions from my Government or additional
supplies.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The aides refused these terms, and without further consultation with
Beauregard notified Anderson that in one hour their batteries would
open fire on the fort. Prompt to the minute, at 4.30 o'clock in the
morning, a shell from Fort Johnson, signalling the bombardment to
begin, burst directly over Sumter. At seven o'clock Anderson's force,
numbering one hundred and twenty-eight officers, men, and
non-combatant labourers, who had breakfasted upon half rations of pork
and damaged rice, began returning the fire, which continued briskly at
first and afterwards intermittently until the evacuation on Sunday
afternoon, the 14th inst.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours the prophecy of Robert Toombs was practically
fulfilled, for when, on Monday, April 15, President Lincoln called for
75,000 State militia to execute the laws, the people of the North rose
almost as one man to support the government. &quot;At the darkest moment in
the history of the Republic,&quot; Emerson wrote, &quot;when it looked as if the
nation would be dismembered, pulverised into its original elements,
the attack on Fort Sumter crystalised the North into a unit, and the
hope of mankind was saved.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Much speculation had been indulged respecting the attitude of New York
City. It was the heart of the Union and the home of Southern sympathy.
Men had argued coolly and philosophically about the right of
secession, and journals of wide influence daily exhibited strong
Southern leanings. Owing to business connections and social
intercourse with the South, merchants had petitioned for concessions
so offen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.4" id="Page_iii.4">iii. 4</a></span>sive to Lincoln that Southern statesmen confidently relied
upon their friendship as an important factor in dividing the North. On
many platforms Daniel S. Dickinson, James T. Brady, John Cochrane, and
others equally well known and influential, had held the North
responsible for conditions that, it was claimed, were driving the
South into secession. So recently as December 20, in a meeting of more
than ordinary importance, held on Pine Street, at which Charles
O'Conor presided, and John A. Dix, John J. Cisco, William B. Astor,
and others of similar character were present, Dickinson declared that
&quot;our Southern brothers will reason with us when we will reason with
them.... The South have not offended us.... But their slaves have been
run off in numbers by an underground railroad, and insult and injury
returned for a constitutional duty.... If we would remain a united
people we must treat the Southern States as we treated them on the
inauguration of the government&#8212;as political equals.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In a speech at Richmond on March 14 Cochrane promised that New York
would sustain Virginia in any policy it adopted,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and on April 4 a
Confederate commissioner, writing from Manhattan, reported to
Jefferson Davis that two hundred of the most influential and wealthy
citizens were then arranging the details to declare New York a free
city. Several army officers as well as leading ship-builders, said the
letter, had been found responsive, through whose assistance recruits
from the ranks of the conspirators were to seize the navy yard, forts,
and vessels of war, and to hold the harbor and city.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> While nothing
was known to the friends of the Union of the existence of such a
conspiracy, deep anxiety prevailed as to how far the spirit of
rebellion which had manifested itself in high places, extended among
the population of the great metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.5" id="Page_iii.5">iii. 5</a></span></p><p>The guns aimed at Sumter, however, quickly removed the impression that
the greed of commerce was stronger than the love of country. The Stock
Exchange resounded with enthusiastic cheers for Major Anderson, and
generous loans showed that the weight of the financial and trade
centre of the country was on the side of the national government. But
more convincing proof of a solid North found expression in the spirit
of the great meeting held at Union Square on Saturday, April 20.
Nothing like it had ever been seen in America. Men of all ranks,
professions, and creeds united in the demonstration. Around six
platforms, each occupied with a corps of patriotic orators, an
illustrious audience, numbering some of the most famous Democrats of
the State, who had quickly discarded political prejudices, stood for
hours listening to loyal utterances that were nobly illustrated by the
valour of Major Anderson, whose presence increased the enthusiasm into
a deafening roar of repeated cheers. If any doubt heretofore existed
as to the right of coercing a State, or upon whom rested the
responsibility for beginning the war, or who were the real enemies of
the Union, or where prominent members of the Democratic party would
stand, it had now disappeared. The partisan was lost in the patriot.</p>

<p>Daniel S. Dickinson travelled two hundred miles to be present at this
meeting, and his attitude, assumed without qualification or
reservation, especially pleased the lovers of the Union. Of all men he
had retained and proclaimed his predilections for the South with the
zeal and stubbornness of an unconverted Saul. Throughout the long
discussion of twenty years his sympathy remained with the South, his
ambitions centred in the South, and his words, whether so intended or
not, encouraged the South to believe in a divided North. But the guns
at Sumter changed him as quickly as a voice converted St. Paul. &quot;It
were profitless,&quot; he said, his eyes resting upon the torn flag that
had waved over Sumter&#8212;&quot;it were profitless to inquire for original or
remote causes; it is no time for indecision or inaction.... I would
assert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.6" id="Page_iii.6">iii. 6</a></span> the power of the government over those who owe it allegiance
and attempt its overthrow, as Brutus put his signet to the
death-warrant of his son, that I might exclaim with him, 'Justice is
satisfied, and Rome is free.' For myself, in our federal relations, I
know but one section, one Union, one flag, one government. That
section embraces every State; that Union is the Union sealed with the
blood and consecrated by the tears of the revolutionary struggle; that
flag is the flag known and honoured in every sea under heaven; that
government is the government of Washington, and Adams, and Jefferson,
and Jackson; a government which has shielded and protected not only
us, but God's oppressed children, who have gathered under its wings
from every portion of the globe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Fernando Wood, until recently planning to make New York an independent
city, now declared the past buried, with its political associations
and sympathies, and pledged the municipality, its money and its men,
to the support of the Union. &quot;I am with you in this contest. We know
no party, now.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Of the fifty or more speeches delivered from the
several platforms, perhaps the address of John Cochrane, whose
ridiculous Richmond oration was scarcely a month old, proved the most
impressive. Cochrane had a good presence, a clear, penetrating voice,
and spoke in round, rhetorical periods. If he sometimes illustrated
the passionate and often the extravagant declaimer, his style was
finished, and his fervid appeals deeply stirred the emotions if they
did not always guide the reason. It was evident that he now spoke with
the sincere emotion of one whose mind and heart were filled with the
cause for which he pleaded. In his peroration, pointing to the torn
flag of Sumter, he raised the vast audience to such a pitch of
excitement that when he dramatically proclaimed his motto to be, &quot;Our
country, our whole country&#8212;in any event,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.7" id="Page_iii.7">iii. 7</a></span> a united country,&quot; the
continued cheering was with great difficulty sufficiently suppressed
to allow the introduction of another speaker.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Of the regiments called for New York's quota was seventeen. Governor
Morgan immediately communicated it to the Legislature, which
authorised in a few hours the enlistment of 30,000 volunteers for two
years. Instantly every drill room and armory in the State became a
scene of great activity, and by April 19, four days after the call,
the Seventh New York, each man carrying forty-eight rounds of ball
cartridge, received an enthusiastic ovation as it marched down
Broadway on its way to Washington. Thereafter, each day presented,
somewhere in the State, a similar pageant. Men offered their services
so much faster than the Government could take them that bitterness
followed the fierce competition.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> By July 1 New York had despatched
to the seat of war 46,700 men&#8212;an aggregate that was swelled by
December 30 to 120,361. Loans to the government, offered with an
equally lavish hand, approximated $33,000,000 in three months.</p>

<p>To aid in the purchase and arming of steamships and in the movement of
troops and forwarding of supplies, President Lincoln, during the
excitement incident to the isolation of Washington, conferred
extraordinary powers upon Governor Morgan, William M. Evarts, and
Moses H. Grinnell, to whom army officers were instructed to report for
orders. Similar powers to act for the Treasury Department in the
disbursement of public money were conferred upon John A. Dix, George
Opdyke, and Richard M. Blatchford. These gentlemen gave no security
and received no compensation, but &quot;I am not aware,&quot; wrote Lincoln, at
a later day, &quot;that a dollar of the public funds, thus confided,
without authority of law, to unofficial persons, was either lost or
wasted.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The Union Square meeting appointed a Union Defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.8" id="Page_iii.8">iii. 8</a></span> Committee to raise
money, provide supplies, and equip regiments. For the time this
committee became the executive arm of the national government in New
York, giving method to effort and concentrating the people's energies
for the highest efficiency. John A. Dix, who had seen sixteen years of
peace service in the regular army, equipped regiments and despatched
them to Washington, while James S. Wadsworth, a man without military
experience but of great public spirit, whose courage and energy
especially fitted him for the work, loaded steamboats with provisions
and accompanied them to Annapolis. Soon afterwards Dix became a
major-general of volunteers, while Wadsworth, eager for active
service, accepted an appointment on General McDowell's staff with the
rank of major. This took him to Manassas, and within a month gave him
a &quot;baptism of fire&quot; which distinguished him for coolness, high
courage, and great capacity. On August 9 he was made a
brigadier-general of volunteers, thus preceding in date of commission
all other New Yorkers of similar rank not graduates of West Point.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Daniel E. Sickles, no less famous in the political
arena, who was to win the highest renown as a fighter, received
similar rank. Sickles, at the age of twenty-two, began public life as
a member of the Assembly, and in the succeeding fourteen years served
as corporation attorney, secretary of legation at London, State
senator, and congressman. A Hunker in politics, an adept with the
revolver, and fearless in defence, he had the habit of doing his own
thinking. Tammany never had a stronger personality. He was not always
a successful leader and he cared little for party discipline, but as
an antagonist bent on having his own way his name had become a
household word in the metropolis and in conventions. In the
anti-slavery crusade his sympathies were Southern. He opposed Lincoln,
he favoured compromise, and he encouraged the cotton States to believe
in a divided North. Nevertheless, when the Union was assaulted, the
soldier spirit that made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.9" id="Page_iii.9">iii. 9</a></span> major of the Twelfth National Guards in
1852 took him to Washington at the head of the Excelsior Brigade,
consisting of five regiments, fully armed and equipped, and ready to
serve during the war. He reached the capital at the time when more
regiments were offered than General Scott would accept, but with the
energy that afterward characterised his action at Gettysburg he sought
the President, who promptly gave him the order that mustered his men
and put him in command.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Other leaders who had voiced Southern
sentiments, notably John Cochrane, soon found places at the front.
Indeed, those who had professed the warmest friendship for the South
were among the first to speak or take up arms against it.</p>

<p>The Confederates, entering upon the path of revolution with the hope
of a divided North, exhibited much feeling over this unanimity of
sentiment. &quot;Will the city of New York 'kiss the rod that smites her,'&quot;
asked the leading paper in Virginia, &quot;and at the bidding of her Black
Republican tyrants war upon her Southern friends and best customers?
Will she sacrifice her commerce, her wealth, her population, her
character, in order to strengthen the arm of her oppressors?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Ten
days later another influential representative of Southern sentiment,
watching the proceedings of the great Union Square meeting, answered
the inquiry. &quot;The statesmen of the North,&quot; said the Richmond
<i>Enquirer</i>, &quot;heretofore most honoured and confided in by the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.10" id="Page_iii.10">iii. 10</a></span>
have come out unequivocally in favor of the Lincoln policy of coercing
and subjugating the South.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Charleston <i>Mercury</i> called the
roll of these statesmen in the several States. &quot;Where,&quot; it asked, &quot;are
Fillmore, Van Buren, Cochrane, McKeon, Weed, Dix, Dickinson, and
Barnard, of New York, in the bloody crusade proposed by President
Lincoln against the South? Unheard of in their dignified retirement,
or hounding on the fanatic warfare, or themselves joining 'the noble
army of martyrs for liberty' marching on the South.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Other papers
were no less indignant. &quot;We are told,&quot; said the Richmond <i>Examiner</i>,
&quot;that the whole North is rallying as one man&#8212;Douglas, veering as ever
with the popular breeze; Buchanan lifting a treacherous and
time-serving voice of encouragement from the icy atmosphere of
Wheatland; and well-fed and well-paid Fillmore, eating up all his past
words of indignation for Southern injuries, and joining in the popular
hue-and-cry against his special benefactors.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The <i>Enquirer</i>,
speaking of Daniel S. Dickinson as &quot;the former crack champion of
Southern Rights,&quot; sneered at his having given his &quot;adhesion to Lincoln
and all his abolition works.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> To the South which believed in the
constitutional right of secession, the contest for the Union was a war
of subjugation, and whoever took part in it was stigmatised. &quot;The
proposition to <i>subjugate</i>,&quot; said the <i>Examiner</i>, &quot;comes from the
metropolis of the North's boasted conservatism, even from the largest
beneficiary of Southern wealth&#8212;New York City.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of the patriotic uprising of the North, so disappointing
and surprising to the South, an event occurred that cast a deep shadow
over New York in common with the rest of the country. The press,
presumably voicing public opinion, demanded that the army begin the
work for which it was organised. Many reasons were given&#8212;some
quixotic, some born of suspicion, and others wholly unworthy their
source. The New York <i>Tribune</i>, in daily articles, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.11" id="Page_iii.11">iii. 11</a></span> alarmingly
impatient, expressing the fear that influences were keeping the armies
apart until peace could be obtained on humiliating terms to the
North.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Finally, on June 27, appeared a four-line, triple-leaded
leader, printed in small capitals, entitled &quot;The Nation's War-Cry.&quot; It
was as mandatory as it was conspicuous. &quot;Forward to Richmond! Forward
to Richmond! The Rebel Congress must not be allowed to meet there on
the 20th of July! By that date the place must be held by the National
Army!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This war-cry appeared from day to day with editorials
indicating a fear of Democratic intrigue, and hinting at General
Scott's insincerity.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>General Scott did not approve a battle at that time. He thought the
troops insufficiently drilled and disciplined. On the other hand, the
President argued that a successful battle would encourage the country,
maintain the unanimity of the war sentiment, and gain the respect of
foreign governments. General McDowell had 30,000 men in the vicinity
of Bull Run, Virginia, of whom 1,600 were regulars&#8212;the rest, for the
most part, three months' volunteers whose term of enlistment soon
expired. At Martinsburg, General Patterson, a veteran of two wars,
commanded 20,000 Federal troops. Opposed to the Union forces, General
Beauregard had an effective army of 22,000, with 9,000 in the
Shenandoah Valley under command of Joseph E. Johnston. In obedience to
the popular demand McDowell moved his troops slowly toward
Beauregard's lines, and on Sunday, July 21, attacked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.12" id="Page_iii.12">iii. 12</a></span> his whole
force, gaining a complete victory by three o'clock in the afternoon.
Meantime, however, Johnston, having eluded Patterson, brought to the
field at the supreme moment two or three thousand fresh troops and
turned a Confederate defeat into a Union rout and panic.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>After coolness and confidence had displaced the confusion of this wild
stampede, it became clear that the battle of Bull Run had been well
planned, and that for inexperienced and undisciplined troops
McDowell's army had fought bravely. It appeared plain that had
Patterson arrived with 2,300 fresh troops instead of Johnston, the
Confederates must have been the routed and panic-stricken party. To
the North, however, defeat was the source of much shame. It seemed a
verification of the Southern boast that one Confederate could whip two
Yankees, and deepened the conviction that the war was to be long and
severe. Moreover, fear was expressed that it would minimise the much
desired sympathy of England and other foreign governments. But it
brought no abatement of energy. With one voice the press of the North
demanded renewed activity, and before a week had elapsed every
department of government girded itself anew for the conflict.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
vigour and enthusiasm of this period have been called a second
uprising of the North, and the work of a few weeks exhibited the
wonderful resources of a patriotic people.</p>

<h2>NEW PARTY ALIGNMENTS</h2>

<h2>1861</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> battle of Bull Run fomented mutterings, freighted with antagonism
to the war. Certain journals violently resented the suspension of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, while the Act of Congress, approved August 3,
providing for the freedom of slaves employed in any military or naval
service, called forth such extreme denunciations that the United
States grand jury for the Southern District of New York asked the
Court if the authors were subject to indictment. &quot;These
newspapers,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> said the foreman, &quot;are in the frequent practice of
encouraging the rebels now in arms against the Federal Government by
expressing sympathy and agreement with them, the duty of acceding to
their demands, and dissatisfaction with the employment of force to
overcome them. Their conduct is, of course, condemned and abhorred by
all loyal men, but the grand jury will be glad to learn from the Court
that they are also subject to indictment and condign punishment.&quot; The
Postmaster-General's order excluding such journals from the mails
intensified the bitterness. The arrests of persons charged with giving
aid and comfort to the enemy also furnished partisans an opportunity
to make people distrustful of such summary methods by magnifying the
danger to personal liberty. In a word, the Bull Run disaster had
become a peg upon which to hang sympathy for the South.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.14" id="Page_iii.14">iii. 14</a></span></p><p>Differences likewise appeared among Republicans. The Weed and
anti-Weed factions still existed, but these divisions now grew out of
differences far deeper than patronage. After the bombardment of Fort
Sumter, Thurlow Weed desired the conflict conducted on lines that
would unite the North into one party responding to the cry of &quot;Union,
now and forever.&quot; He believed this might be done and that rebellion
could thus be confined to the extreme cotton region, if the loyal
element in the Border States was cherished and representatives of all
parties were permitted to participate in civil as well as military
affairs. To this end he sought to avoid the question of emancipation,
cordially approving the President's course in modifying Fremont's
proclamation of the preceding August, which liberated the slaves of
traitorous owners in Missouri. Weed pushed his contention to the
extreme. Following the spirit of his rejected compromise he insisted
that every act of the Government should strengthen and encourage the
Union men of the Border States, among which he included North Carolina
and Tennessee, and he bitterly resented the policy of urging the army,
hastily and without due preparation, to fight &quot;political battles&quot; like
that of Bull Run. On the other hand, the radical anti-slavery element
of the country, led by Secretary Chase in the Cabinet, by Senator
Sumner in Congress, and backed by Horace Greeley in the <i>Tribune</i>,
disliked the President's policy of trying to conciliate Kentucky and
other Border States by listening to the demands of slavery. This
factional difference became doubly pronounced after Lincoln's
modification of the Fremont proclamation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Democratic criticisms and Republican differences,
however, the supporters of Lincoln, anxious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.15" id="Page_iii.15">iii. 15</a></span> teach the seceding
States an object lesson in patriotism, desired to unite both parties
into one Union organisation, pledged to the vigorous prosecution of
the war and the execution of the laws in all parts of the country. To
Republicans this plan looked easy. Most people professed to favour the
preservation of the Union, and thousands of young men irrespective of
party had enlisted for the suppression of armed rebellion. Moreover, a
union of parties at such a critical moment, it was argued, would be
more helpful in discouraging the South than victory on the
battlefield. Accordingly the Republican State Committee proposed to
the Democrats early in August that in the election to occur on
November 4 a single ticket be nominated, fairly representative of all
parties upon a simple war platform.</p>

<p>About Dean Richmond, chairman of the Democratic State Committee, still
clustered Peter Cagger, William B. Ludlow, Sanford E. Church, and
other Soft leaders, with Horatio Seymour substantially in control.
These men had not participated in the Union Square meeting on April
20, nor had their sentiments been voiced since the fall of Fort
Sumter; but it was well known that their views did not coincide with
those of Daniel S. Dickinson, John A. Dix, James T. Brady, Greene C.
Bronson, and other leaders of the Hards. Richmond's reply, therefore,
was not disappointing. He admitted the wisdom of filling public
offices with pure and able men who commanded the confidence of the
people, and suggested, with a play of sarcasm, that if such an example
were set in filling Federal offices, it would probably be followed in
the selection of State officers. But the politics of men in office, he
continued, was of little importance compared to sound principles.
Democrats would unite with all citizens opposed to any war and equally
to any peace which is based upon the idea of the separation of these
States, and who regard it the duty of the Federal government at all
times to hold out terms of peace and accommodation to the dissevered
States.</p>

<p>&quot;Our political system,&quot; he continued, &quot;was founded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.16" id="Page_iii.16">iii. 16</a></span> compromise, and
it can never be dishonourable in any Administration to seek to restore
it by the same means. Above all, they repel the idea that there exists
between the two sections of the Union such an incompatibility of
institutions as to give rise to an irrepressible conflict between
them, which can only terminate in the subjugation of one or the other.
Repelling the doctrine that any State can rightfully secede from the
Union, they hold next in abhorrence that aggressive and fanatical
sectional policy which has so largely contributed to the present
danger of the country. They propose, therefore, to invite to union
with them all citizens of whatever party, who, believing in these
views, will act with them to secure honest administration in Federal
and State affairs, a rigid maintenance of the Constitution, economy in
public expenditures, honesty in the award of contracts, justice to the
soldier in the field and the taxpayer at home, and the expulsion of
corrupt men from office.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected, perhaps, that Dean Richmond and other
representatives of a great party would be willing, even if moved by no
other motive than a love of country, to abandon a political
organisation that had existed for years, and that had already shown
its patriotism by the generous enlistment of its members; but it is
doubtful if they would have proclaimed, without the guidance of a
State convention, such an elaborate and positive platform of
principles, had not the serious defeat at Bull Run and the action of
the President in suspending the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, subjected the
national Administration to severe criticism. This, at least, was the
view taken by the radical Republican press, which viciously attacked
the patriotism of Richmond and his associates, charging them with
using the livery of Democracy to serve the cause of treason.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of these developments the Democratic State convention,
made up of a larger number of old men than usual, assembled at
Syracuse on September 4. It was not an enthusiastic body. The division
upon national affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.17" id="Page_iii.17">iii. 17</a></span> plainly had a depressing influence. Francis
Kernan became temporary chairman. At the Oneida bar, Kernan, then
forty-five years old, had been for nearly two decades the peer of
Hiram Denio, Samuel Beardsley, Ward Hunt, and Joshua Spencer. He was a
forceful speaker, cool and self-possessed, with a pleasing voice and
good manner. He could not be called an orator, but he was a master of
the art of making a perfectly clear statement, and in defending his
position, point by point, with never failing readiness and skill, he
had few if any superiors. He belonged, also, to that class of able
lawyers who are never too busy to take an active interest in public
affairs.</p>

<p>In his brief address Kernan clearly outlined the position which the
Democracy of the whole country was to occupy. &quot;It is our duty,&quot; he
said, &quot;to oppose abolitionism at the North and secession at the South,
which are equally making war upon our Government. Let us consign them
both to a common grave. Never will our country see peace unless we
do.... We care not what men are in charge of the Government, it is our
duty as patriots and as Democrats to protect and preserve that
Government, and resist with arms, and, if need be, with our lives, the
men who seek to overthrow it; but this must be no war for the
emancipation of slaves.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The vigor of Kernan as a speaker and presiding officer exaggerated by
contrast the feebleness of Herman J. Redfield, the permanent president
of the convention. Redfield was an old man, a mere reminiscence of the
days of DeWitt Clinton, whose speech, read in a low, weak voice, was
directed mainly to a defence of the sub-treasury plan of 1840 and the
tariff act of 1846.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He professed to favour a vigorous prosecution
of the war, but there were no words of repro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.18" id="Page_iii.18">iii. 18</a></span>bation for its authors,
while he expressed the belief that &quot;civil war will never preserve, but
forever destroy the union of States.&quot; This was the prophecy of Reuben
H. Walworth, the ex-chancellor, made at the Albany peace convention in
the preceding January, and the applause that greeted the statement
then, as it did at Syracuse, indicated a disposition on the part of
many to favour concessions that would excuse if it did not absolutely
justify secession.</p>

<p>The party platform, however, took little notice of the Redfield speech
and the Redfield cheers. It declared that the right of secession did
not anywhere or at any time exist; that the seizure of United States
property and the sending out of privateers to prey on American
commerce had precipitated the war; and that it was the duty of the
government to put down rebellion with all the means in its power, and
the duty of the people to rally about the government; but it also
demanded that Congress call a convention of all the States to revise
the Constitution, and that the Administration abandon the narrow
platform of the Chicago convention, expel corrupt men from office, and
exclude advocates of abolition from the Cabinet, declaring that it
would &quot;regard any attempt to pervert the conflict into a war for the
emancipation of slaves as fatal to the hope of restoring the Union.&quot;</p>

<p>The debate upon the platform was destined to bring into prominence a
broader loyalty than even Francis Kernan had exhibited. Arphaxed
Loomis moved to restore the resolution, expunged in the committee's
report, protesting against the passport system, the State police
system, the suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.19" id="Page_iii.19">iii. 19</a></span> of free discussion in the press, and the
suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. It is doubtful if the
freedom of the press had been materially abridged, since restrictions
upon a few newspapers, charged with giving aid and comfort to the
enemy, scarcely exceeded the proscription of anti-slavery papers
before the war. The suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
however, furnished better grounds for complaint. Men were apprehended,
often on the telegram of Secretary Seward, and committed to prison,
without any offence being charged or an examination being made. Among
others arrested were two men at Malone, besides an editor of the New
York <i>News</i>, and a crippled newsboy who sold the <i>News</i>. Public
sentiment generally sustained the Administration in such action, but
many persons, including conservative Republicans, frequently
questioned the right or justice of such procedure. &quot;What are we coming
to,&quot; asked Senator Trumbull of Illinois, &quot;if arrests may be made at
the whim or the caprice of a cabinet minister?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Loomis, in
insisting upon his resolution, had these arbitrary arrests in mind,
maintaining that it embodied the true principles of Democracy, which
he was unwilling to see violated without recording a protest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.20" id="Page_iii.20">iii. 20</a></span></p>
<p>This brought to his feet Albert P. Laning of Buffalo. He was younger
by a score of years than Loomis, and although never as prominent,
perhaps, as the great advocate of legal reformative measures, his
remarkable memory and thorough grasp of legal principles had listed
him among the strong lawyers of Western New York. To the convention he
was well known as a clear, forceful speaker, who had been a student of
political history as well as of law, and who, in spite of his ardent
devotion to his profession, had revealed, when shaping the policy of
his party, the personal gifts and remarkable power of sustained
argument that win admiration.</p>

<p>At Syracuse, in 1861, Laning, just then in his early forties, was in
the fulness of his intellectual power. He had followed Douglas and
favored the Crittenden Compromise, but the fall of Sumter crippled his
sympathy for the South and stiffened his support of the Federal
administration. Moreover, he understood the difficulty, during a
period of war, of conducting an impartial, constitutional opposition
to the policy of the Administration, without its degeneration into a
faction, which at any moment might be shaken by interest, prejudice,
or passion. The motion of Loomis, therefore, seemed to him too narrow,
and he opposed it with eloquence, maintaining that it was the duty of
all good men not to embarrass the Government in such a crisis. Rather
than that bold rebellion should destroy the government, he said, he
preferred to allow the President to take his own course. The
responsibility was upon him, and the people, irrespective of party,
should strengthen his hands until danger had disappeared and the
government was re-established in all its strength.</p>

<p>Kernan did not take kindly to these sentiments. Like Loomis he
resented arbitrary arrests in States removed from actual hostilities,
where the courts were open for the regular administration of justice,
and with a few ringing sentences he threw the delegates into wild
cheering. Though brief, this speech resulted in restoring the Loomis
resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.21" id="Page_iii.21">iii. 21</a></span> to its place in the platform, and in increasing the
clamour that Kernan lead the party as a candidate for
attorney-general. Kernan was not averse to taking office. For three
years, from 1856 to 1859, he had been official reporter for the Court
of Appeals, and in 1860 served in the Assembly. Later, he entered
Congress, finally reaching the United States Senate. But in 1861
prudence prompted him to decline the tempting offer of a nomination
for attorney-general, and although entreated to reconsider his
determination, he stubbornly resisted, and at last forced the
nomination of Lyman Tremaine of Albany, who had previously held the
office.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The work of the convention did not please all members of the party. To
some the drift of the speeches and resolutions seemed an encouragement
to armed rebellion; to others, although jealous of individual rights,
it appeared to confuse the liberty of the press with license. One
paper, an able representative of the party, disclaiming any desire &quot;to
rekindle animosities by discussing its various objectionable points,&quot;
felt &quot;bound to express its heartfelt repugnance of the malignant and
traitorous spirit which animates the Loomis resolution.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> These
were severe words, showing that others than Laning opposed such
criticism of the President.</p>

<p>Dean Richmond's refusal to unite in a Union convention did not stifle
the hope that many Democrats might participate in such a meeting, and
to afford them an opportunity a People's convention met at Wieting
Hall in Syracuse, on September 11, contemporaneously with the
Republican State convention. It became evident that the purpose was
attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.22" id="Page_iii.22">iii. 22</a></span> when the Democrats present declared that the banner of their
former party no longer marked a place for them to muster. In character
the members resembled determined Abolitionists in the forties. Its
president, Thomas G. Alvord of Onondaga, had been speaker of the
Assembly, a competitor of Gordon Granger for Congress, and a
pronounced Hard Shell until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise
drove him into the camp of the Softs. One of the delegates, James B.
McKean, was soon to lead the Sixty-seventh Regiment to the field;
another, Alexander S. Diven of Chemung was to enter Congress, and
subsequently to distinguish himself at Antietam and Chancellorsville
at the head of the One Hundred and Seventh; other participants,
conspicuous in their respective localities, were to suffer bitterly
and struggle bravely to maintain the Union. One delegate sung the
&quot;Star Spangled Banner,&quot; while the others, with radiant faces, broke
into cheers. This was followed by several brief and vigorous speeches
approving the war and the methods by which it was conducted. &quot;There is
no medium, no half way now,&quot; said one delegate, &quot;between patriots and
traitors.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This was the sentiment of the platform, which waived
all political divisions and party traditions, declaring that the
convention sought only, in this hour of national peril, to proclaim
devotion to the Constitution and Union, and to defend and sustain the
chosen authorities of the government at whatever cost of blood and
treasure.</p>

<p>Rumours of Daniel S. Dickinson's nomination had been in the air from
the outset. He had been much in the public eye since the 20th of
April. In his zeal for the Union, said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;his pointed
utterances have everywhere fired the hearts of patriots.&quot; Freedom from
the blighting influence of slavery seemed to give him easier flight,
and his criticism of the Democratic convention was so felicitous, so
full of story and wit and ridicule and the fire of genuine patriotism,
that his name was quickly upon every lip, and his happy, homely hits
the common property of half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.23" id="Page_iii.23">iii. 23</a></span> people of the State.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The mention
of his name for attorney-general, therefore, evoked the most
enthusiastic applause. Since the constitutional convention of 1846 it
had been the custom, in the absence of a candidate for governor, to
write the name of the nominee for secretary of state at the head of
the ticket; but in this instance the committee deemed it wise to
nominate for attorney-general first and give it to the man of first
importance. The nomination proved a popular hit. Instantly Syracuse
and the State were ablaze, and Republican as well as many Democratic
papers prophesied that it settled the result in November. The
convention professed to discard party lines and traditions, and its
sincerity, thus put early to the test, did much to magnify its work,
since with marked impartiality it placed upon its ticket two Hards,
two Softs, one American, and four Republicans.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Whenever the People's convention recessed delegates to the Republican
convention immediately took control. Indeed, so closely related were
the two assemblies that spectators at one became delegates to the
other. Weed did not attend the convention, but it adopted his
conciliatory policy. &quot;The popular fiat has gone forth in opposition,
on the one hand, to secession and disunion, whether in the shape of
active rebellion, or its more insidious ally, advocacy of an
inglorious and dishonourable peace; and, on the other, to everything
that savors of abolition, or tends towards a violation of the
guarantees of slave property provided by the Constitution.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.24" id="Page_iii.24">iii. 24</a></span></p>
<p>It cannot be said that the Democratic campaign opened under flattering
conditions. Loomis' resolution, known as the ninth or &quot;secession&quot;
plank, had led to serious difficulty. Men recognised that in time of
war more reserve was necessary in dealing with an Administration than
during a period of peace, for if the government's arm was paralysed it
could not stay the arm of the public enemy. This had been the position
of Laning, and it appealed strongly to Lyman Tremaine, who believed
the machinations of treason had forced the Government to suspend the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and to organise systems of passports and
State police. He boldly declined, therefore, to accept a nomination as
attorney-general on a platform that emphatically condemned such
measures, when deemed essential to the government's safety.</p>

<p>Tremaine, tall, portly, and commanding, belonged to the more
independent members of the party. He was not a stranger to public
life. Although but forty-two years old he had been an active party
worker for a quarter of a century and an office-holder since his
majority. Greene County made him supervisor, district attorney, and
county judge, and soon after his removal to Albany in 1854 he became
attorney-general. But these honours did not break his independence. He
inherited a genius for the forum, and although his gifts did not put
him into the first class, his name was familiar throughout the State.</p>

<p>Francis C. Brouck's withdrawal soon followed Tremaine's.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Then
Tammany repudiated the Loomis resolutions,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and the Albany <i>Argus</i>
shouted lustily for war.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But the blow that staggered Richmond came
from the candidates who caught the drift of public sentiment, and in a
proclamation of few words declared &quot;in favour of vigorously sustaining
the Government in its present struggle to maintain the Constitution
and the Union, at all hazards, and at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.25" id="Page_iii.25">iii. 25</a></span> cost of blood and
treasure.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> This was the act of despair. For days they had waited,
and now, alarmed by the evident change, they jumped from the plank
that was sinking under them. &quot;It is the first instance on record,&quot;
said the <i>Herald</i>, &quot;where the nominees of a convention openly and
defiantly spit upon the platform, and repudiated party leaders and
their secession heresies.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the difference between the great mass of Democrats and
the supporters of the People's party was more apparent than real.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Each professed undying devotion to the Union. Each, also, favoured a
vigorous prosecution of the war. As the campaign advanced the activity
of the army strengthened this loyalty and minimised the criticism of
harsh methods. Moreover, the impression obtained that the war would
soon be over.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> McClellan was in command, and the people had not yet
learned that &quot;our chicken was no eagle, after all,&quot; as Lowell
expressed it.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Controversy over the interference with slavery also
became less acute. John Cochrane, now commanding a regiment at the
front, declared, in a speech to his soldiers, that slaves of the
enemy, being elements of strength, ought to be captured as much as
muskets or cannon, and that whenever he could seize a slave, and even
arm him to fight for the government, he would do so.</p>

<p>In conducting the campaign the People's leaders discoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.26" id="Page_iii.26">iii. 26</a></span>tenanced any
criticism of the Government's efforts to restore the Union. &quot;It is not
Lincoln and the Republicans we are sustaining,&quot; wrote Daniel S.
Dickinson. &quot;They have nothing to do with it. It is the government of
our fathers, worth just as much as if it was administered by Andrew
Jackson. There is but one side to it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> As a rule the Hards
accepted this view, and at the ratification of the ticket in New York,
on September 20, Lyman Tremaine swelled the long list of speakers. A
letter was also read from Greene C. Bronson. To those who heard James
T. Brady at Cooper Institute on the evening of October 28 he seemed
inspired. His piercing eyes burned in their sockets, and his animated
face, now pale with emotion, expressed more than his emphatic words
the loathing felt for men who had plunged their country into bloody
strife.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it remained for Daniel S. Dickinson to stigmatise the
Democratic party. At the Union Square meeting he had burned his
bridges. It was said he had nowhere else to go; that the Hards went
out of business when the South went out of the Union; and that to the
Softs he was <i>non persona grata</i>. There was much truth in this
statement. But having once become a Radical his past affiliations gave
him some advantages. For more than twenty years he had been known
throughout the State as a Southern sympathiser. In the United States
Senate he stood with the South for slavery, and in the election of
1860 he voted for Breckinridge. He was the most conspicuous doughface
in New York. Now, he was an advocate of vigorous war and a pronounced
supporter of President Lincoln. This gave him the importance of a new
convert at a camp meeting. The people believed he knew what he was
talking about, and while his stories and apt illustrations, enriched
by a quick change in voice and manner, convulsed his audiences,
imbedded in his wit and rollicking fun were most convincing arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.27" id="Page_iii.27">iii. 27</a></span>
which appealed to the best sentiments of his hearers.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Indeed, it
is not too much to say that Daniel S. Dickinson, as an entertaining
and forceful platform speaker, filled the place in 1861 which John Van
Buren occupied in the Free-soil campaign in 1848.</p>

<p>A single address by Horatio Seymour, delivered at Utica on October 28,
proved his right to speak for the Democratic party. He had a difficult
task to perform. Men had changed front in a day, and to one of his
views, holding rebellion as a thing to be crushed without impairing
existing conditions, it seemed imperative to divorce &quot;revolutionary
emancipators&quot; from the conservative patriots who loved their country
as it was. He manifested a desire to appear scrupulously loyal to the
Government, counseling obedience to constituted authorities, respect
for constitutional obligations, and a just and liberal support of the
President, in whose favour every presumption should be given. The
suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the long list of
arbitrary arrests had provoked Seymour as it did many conservative
Republicans, but however much individual rights may be violated, he
said, so long as the country is engaged in a struggle for its
existence, confidence, based upon the assumption that imperative
reasons exist for these unusual measures, must be reposed in the
Administration. This was the incarnation of loyalty.</p>

<p>But Seymour closed his address with an ugly crack of the whip.
Dropping his well-selected words with the skill of a practised
debater, he blended the history of past wrongs with those of the
present, thus harrowing his auditors into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.28" id="Page_iii.28">iii. 28</a></span> frame of mind as
resentful and passionate as his own. When the public safety permits,
he said threateningly, there will be abundant time to condemn and
punish the authors of injustice and wrong, whether they occupy the
presidential chair or seats in the cabinet. &quot;Let them remember the
teachings of history. Despotic governments do not love the agitators
that call them into existence. When Cromwell drove from Parliament the
latter-day saints and higher-law men of his day, and 'bade them cease
their babblings;' and when Napoleon scattered at the point of the
bayonet the Council of Five Hundred and crushed revolution beneath his
iron heel, they taught a lesson which should be heeded this day by men
who are animated by a vindictive piety or a malignant philanthropy....
It is the boast of the Briton that his house is his castle. However
humble it may be, the King cannot enter. Let it not be said that the
liberties of American citizens are less perfectly protected, or held
less sacred than are those of the subjects of a Crown.&quot;</p>

<p>The slavery question was less easily and logically handled. He denied
that it caused the war, but admitted that the agitators did, putting
into the same class &quot;the ambitious man at the South, who desired a
separate confederacy,&quot; and &quot;the ambitious men of the North, who reaped
a political profit from agitation.&quot; In deprecating emancipation he
carefully avoided the argument of military necessity, so forcibly put
by John Cochrane, and strangely overlooked the fact that the South, by
the act of rebellion, put itself outside the protection guaranteed
under the Constitution to loyal and law-abiding citizens. &quot;If it be
true,&quot; he said, &quot;that slavery must be abolished to save this Union,
then the people of the South should be allowed to withdraw themselves
from the Government which cannot give them the protection guaranteed
by its terms.&quot; Immediate emancipation, he continued, would not end the
contest. &quot;It would be only the commencement of a lasting, destructive,
terrible domestic conflict. The North would not consent that four
millions of free negroes should live in their midst.... With what
jus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.29" id="Page_iii.29">iii. 29</a></span>tice do we demand that the South should be subjected to the evils,
the insecurity, and the loss of constitutional rights, involved in
immediate abolition?&quot; Then, dropping into prophecy, the broad,
optimistic statesmanship of the forties passed into eclipse as he
declared that &quot;we are either to be restored to our former position,
with the Constitution unweakened, the powers of the State unimpaired,
and the fireside rights of our citizens duly protected, or our whole
system of government is to fall!&quot;</p>

<p>Seymour, in closing, very clearly outlined his future platform. &quot;We
are willing to support this war as a means of restoring our Union, but
we will not carry it on in a spirit of hatred, malice, or revenge. We
cannot, therefore, make it a war for the abolition of slavery. We will
not permit it to be made a war upon the rights of the States. We shall
see that it does not crush out the liberties of the citizen, or the
reserved powers of the States. We shall hold that man to be as much a
traitor who urges our government to overstep its constitutional
powers, as he who resists the exercise of its rightful authority. We
shall contend that the rights of the States and the General Government
are equally sacred.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>If the campaign contributed to the South a certain degree of comfort,
reviving the hope that it would yet have a divided North to contend
against, the election, giving Dickinson over 100,000 majority,
furnished little encouragement. The People's party also carried both
branches of the Legislature, securing twenty out of thirty-two
senators, and seventy out of the one hundred and twenty-eight
assemblymen. Among the latter, Henry J. Raymond and Thomas G. Alvord,
former speakers, represented the undaunted mettle needed at Albany.</p>

<p>To add to the result so gratifying to the fusionists, George Opdyke
defeated Fernando Wood by a small plurality for mayor of New York.
Wood had long been known as a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He talked
reform and grew degen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.30" id="Page_iii.30">iii. 30</a></span>erate; he proclaimed patriotic views and held
disloyal sentiments; he listened respectfully to public opinion, and
defied it openly in his acts. He did not become a boss. It was ten
years later before William M. Tweed centralised Tammany's power in one
man. But Wood developed the system that made a boss possible. He
dominated the police, he organised the lawless, he allied himself with
the saloon, and he used the judiciary. In 1858, being forced out of
Tammany, he retreated like a wounded tiger to Mozart Hall, organised
an opposition society that took its name from the assembly room in
which it met, and declared with emphasis and expletives that he would
fight Tammany as long as he lived. From that moment his shadow had
kept sachems alarmed, and his presence had thrown conventions into
turmoil.</p>

<p>The arts of the card-sharper and thimble-rigger had been prodigally
employed to save the candidate of Mozart Hall. Even the sachems of
Tammany, to avert disaster, nominated James T. Brady, whose great
popularity it was believed would draw strength from both Opdyke and
Wood; but Brady refused to be used. Opdyke had been a liberal,
progressive Democrat of the Free-Soil type and a pioneer Republican.
He associated with Chase in the Buffalo convention of 1848 and
co&#246;perated with Greeley in defeating Seward in 1860. He had also
enjoyed the career of a busy and successful merchant, and, although
fifty years old, was destined to take a prominent part in municipal
politics for the next two decades. One term in the Assembly summed up
his office-holding experience; yet in that brief and uneventful period
jobbers learned to shun him and rogues to fear him. This was one
reason why the brilliant and audacious leader of Mozart Hall, in his
death struggle with an honest man, suddenly assumed to be the champion
of public purity.</p>

<h2>&#8220;THE MAD DESPERATION OF REACTION&#8221;</h2>

<h2>1862</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> its confidence in General McClellan, whose success in
West Virginia had made him the successor of General Scott, giving him
command of all the United States forces, the North, by midsummer,
became profoundly discouraged. Many events contributed to it. The
defeat at Ball's Bluff on the Potomac, which Roscoe Conkling likened
to the battle of Cann&#230;, because &quot;the very pride and flower of our
young men were among its victims,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> had been followed by
conspicuous incompetence at Manassas and humiliating failure on the
Peninsula. Moreover, financial difficulties increased the despondency.
At the outbreak of hostilities practical repudiation of Southern debts
had brought widespread disaster. &quot;The fabric of New York's mercantile
prosperity,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;lies in ruins, beneath which ten
thousand fortunes are buried. Last fall the merchant was a capitalist;
to-day he is a bankrupt.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In September, 1861, these losses
aggregated $200,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Besides, the strain of raising sufficient
funds to meet government expenses had forced a suspension of specie
payment and driven people to refuse United States notes payable on
demand without interest. Meantime, the nation's expenses aggregated
$2,000,000 a day and the Treasury was empty. &quot;I have been obliged,&quot;
wrote the Secretary of the Treasury, &quot;to draw for the last installment
of the November loan.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.32" id="Page_iii.32">iii. 32</a></span></p><p>To meet this serious financial condition, Elbridge G. Spaulding of
Buffalo, then a member of Congress, had been designated to prepare an
emergency measure to avoid national bankruptcy. &quot;We must have at least
$100,000,000 during the next three months,&quot; he wrote, on January 8,
1862, &quot;or the government must stop payment.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Spaulding, then
fifty-two years of age, was president of a bank, a trained financier,
and already the possessor of a large fortune. Having served in the
Thirty-first Congress, he had returned in 1859, after an absence of
eight years, to remain four years longer. Strong, alert, and
sufficiently positive to be stubborn, he possessed the confidence of
Thaddeus Stevens, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who
approved his plan of issuing $100,000,000 legal-tender, non-interest
bearing treasury notes, exchangeable at par for six-twenty bonds.
Spaulding fully appreciated the objections to his policy, but the only
other course, he argued, was to sell bonds as in the war of 1812,
which, if placed at six percent interest, would not, in his opinion,
bring more than sixty cents&#8212;a ruinous method of conducting
hostilities. However, his plea of necessity found a divided committee
and in Roscoe Conkling a most formidable opponent, who attacked the
measure as unnecessary, extravagant, unsound, without precedent, of
doubtful constitutionality, and morally imperfect.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>It was in this debate that Conkling, adroitly choosing the right time
and the proper subject, impressed the country with his power as an
orator and his ability as a brilliant, resourceful debater, although,
perhaps, a destructive rather than constructive legislator. Nature had
lavished upon him superb gifts of mind and person. He was of
commanding, even magnificent presence, six feet three inches tall,
with regular features, lofty forehead, and piercing eyes,&#8212;blond and
gigantic as a viking. It was difficult, indeed, for a man so
superlatively handsome not to be vain, and the endeavour upon his part
to conceal the defect was not in evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.33" id="Page_iii.33">iii. 33</a></span>dence. Although an unpopular and
unruly schoolboy, who refused to go to college, he had received a good
education, learning much from a scholarly father, a college-bred man,
and an ornament to the United States District Court for more than a
quarter of a century. Moreover, from early youth Conkling had studied
elocution, training a strong, slightly musical voice, and learning the
use of secondary accents, the choice of words, the value of deliberate
speech, and the assumption of an impressive earnestness. In this
debate, too, he discovered the talent for ridicule and sarcasm that
distinguished him in later life, when he had grown less considerate of
the feelings of opponents, and indicated something of the
imperiousness and vanity which clouded an otherwise attractive manner.</p>

<p>As he stubbornly and eloquently contested the progress of the
legal-tender measure with forceful argument and a wealth of
information, Conkling seemed likely to deprive Spaulding of the title
of &quot;father of the greenback&quot; until the Secretary of the Treasury,
driven to desperation for want of money, reluctantly came to the
Congressman's rescue and forced the bill through Congress.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> By
midsummer, however, gold had jumped to seventeen per cent., while the
cost of the war, augmented by a call for 300,000 three years' men and
by a draft of 300,000 nine months' militia, rested more heavily than
ever upon the country. Moreover, by September 1 McClellan had been
deprived of his command, the Army of the Potomac had suffered defeat
at the second battle of Bull Run, and Lee and Longstreet, with a
victorious army, were on their way to Maryland. The North stood
aghast!</p>

<p>Much more ominous than military disaster and financial embarrassment,
however, was the divisive sentiment over emancipation. Northern
armies, moving about in slave communities, necessarily acted as a
constant disintegrating force. Slaves gave soldiers aid and
information, and soldiers, stimu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.34" id="Page_iii.34">iii. 34</a></span>lated by their natural hostility to
slave-owners, gave slaves protection and sympathy. Thus, very early in
the war, many men believed that rebellion and slavery were so
intertwined that both must be simultaneously overthrown. This
sentiment found expression in the Fremont proclamation, issued on
August 30, 1861, setting free all slaves owned by persons who aided
secession in the military department of Missouri. On the other hand,
the Government, seeking to avoid the slavery question, encouraged
military commanders to refuse refuge to the negroes within their
lines, and in modifying Fremont's order to conform to the Confiscation
Act of August 6, the President aroused a discussion characterised by
increasing acerbity, which divided the Republican party into Radicals
and Conservatives. The former, led by the <i>Tribune</i>, resented the
attitude of army officers, who, it charged, being notoriously in more
or less thorough sympathy with the inciting cause of rebellion, failed
to seize opportunities to strike at slavery. Among Radicals the belief
obtained that one half of the commanding generals desired to prosecute
the war so delicately that slavery should receive the least possible
harm, and in their comments in Congress and in the press they made no
concealment of their opinion, that such officers were much more
anxious to restore fugitive slaves to rebel owners than to make their
owners prisoners of war.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> They were correspondingly flattering to
those generals who proclaimed abolition as an adjunct of the war.
Greeley's taunts had barbed points. &quot;He is no extemporised soldier,
looking for a presidential nomination or seat in Congress,&quot; he said of
General Hunter, whose order had freed the slaves in South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida. &quot;He is neither a political or civil engineer,
but simply a patriot whose profession is war, and who does not
understand making war so as not to hurt your enemy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>When the <i>Times</i>, an exponent of the Conservatives, defended the
Administration's policy with the declaration that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.35" id="Page_iii.35">iii. 35</a></span> slaves were used as
fast as obtained,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the <i>Tribune</i> minimized the intelligence of its
editor. &quot;Consider,&quot; it said, &quot;the still unmodified order of McDowell,
issued a full year ago, forbidding the harbouring of negroes within
our lines. Consider Halleck's order, now nine months old and still
operative, forbidding negroes to come within our lines at all.
McClellan has issued a goodly number of orders and proclamations, but
not one of them offers protection and freedom to such slaves of rebels
as might see fit to claim them at his hands. His only order bearing
upon their condition and prospects is that which expelled the
Hutchinsons from his camp for the crime of singing anti-slavery
songs.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The dominant sentiment in Congress reflected the feeling of the
Radicals, and under the pressure of McClellan's reverses before
Richmond, the House, on July 11, and the Senate on the following day,
passed the Confiscation Act, freeing forever the slaves of rebel
owners whenever within control of the Government. The Administration's
failure to enforce this act in the spirit and to the extent that
Congress intended, finally brought out the now historic &quot;Prayer of
Twenty Millions&quot;&#8212;an editorial signed by Horace Greeley and addressed
to Abraham Lincoln. It charged the President with being disastrously
remiss in the discharge of his official duty and unduly influenced by
the menaces of border slave State politicians. It declared that the
Union was suffering from timid counsels and mistaken deference to
rebel slavery; that all attempts to put down rebellion and save
slavery are preposterous and futile; and that every hour of obeisance
to slavery is an added hour of deepened peril to the Union. In
conclusion, he entreated the Chief Executive to render hearty and
unequivocal obedience to the law of the land.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.36" id="Page_iii.36">iii. 36</a></span></p>
<p>Thus did Greeley devote his great powers to force Lincoln into
emancipation. It is impossible, even at this distance of time, to turn
the pages of his ponderous volumes without feeling the matchless force
of his energy, the strength of his masterly array of facts, his biting
sarcasm, his bold assumptions, and his clear, unadorned style. There
is about it all an impassioned conviction, as if he spoke because he
could not keep silent, making it impossible to avoid the belief that
the whole soul and conscience of the writer were in his work. Day
after day, with kaleidoscopic change, he marshalled arguments, facts,
and historical parallels, bearing down the reader's judgment as he
swept away like a great torrent the criticisms of himself and the
arguments of his opponents. Nothing apparently could withstand his
onslaught on slavery. With one dash of his pen he forged sentences
that, lance-like, found their way into every joint of the monster's
armour.</p>

<p>Greeley's criticism of the President and the army, however, gave his
enemies vantage ground for renewed attacks. Ever since he suggested,
at the beginning of hostilities, that the <i>Herald</i> did not care which
flag floated over its office, James Gordon Bennett, possessing the
genuine newspaper genius, had daily evinced a deep, personal dislike
of the <i>Tribune's</i> editor, and throughout the discussion of
emancipation, the <i>Herald</i>, in bitter editorials, kept its columns in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.37" id="Page_iii.37">iii. 37</a></span>
a glow, tantalising the <i>Tribune</i> with a persistency that recalls
Cheetham's attacks upon Aaron Burr. The strategical advantage lay with
the <i>Herald</i>, since the initiative belonged to the <i>Tribune</i>, but the
latter had with it the preponderating sentiment of its party and the
growing influence of a war necessity. Greeley fought with a
broad-sword, swinging it with a vigorous and well-aimed effect, while
Bennett, with lighter weapon, pricked, stabbed, and cut. Never
inactive, the latter sought to aggravate and embitter. Greeley, on the
contrary, intent upon forcing the Administration to change its policy,
ignored his tormentor, until exasperation, like the gathering steam in
a geyser, drove him into further action. In this prolonged controversy
the <i>Tribune</i> invariably referred to its adversary as &quot;the <i>Herald</i>,&quot;
but in the <i>Herald</i>, &quot;Greeley,&quot; &quot;old Greeley,&quot; &quot;poor Greeley,&quot; &quot;Mars
Greeley,&quot; &quot;poor crazy Greeley,&quot; became synonyms for the editor of the
<i>Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>The fight of these able and conspicuous journals represented the
fierceness with which emancipation was pushed and opposed throughout
the State. Conservative men, therefore, realising the danger to which
a bitter campaign along strict party lines would subject the Union
cause, demanded that all parties rally to the support of the
Government with a candidate for governor devoted to conservative
principles and a vigorous prosecution of the war. Sentiment seemed to
point to John A. Dix as such a man. Though not distinguished as a
strategist or effective field officer, he possessed courage, caution,
and a desire to crush the rebellion. The policy of this movement,
embracing conservative Republicans and war Democrats, was urged by
Thurlow Weed, sanctioned by Seward, and heartily approved by John Van
Buren, who, since the beginning of hostilities, had avoided party
councils. The Constitutional Union party, composed of old line Whigs
who opposed emancipation,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> proposed to lead this movement at its
convention, to be held at Troy on September 9, but at the appointed
time James Brooks, by prearrangement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.38" id="Page_iii.38">iii. 38</a></span> appeared with a file of
instructed followers, captured the meeting, and gave Horatio Seymour
32 votes to 20 for Dix and 6 for Millard Fillmore. This unexpected
result made Seymour the candidate of the Democratic State convention
which met at Albany on the following day.</p>

<p>Seymour sincerely preferred another. Early in August he travelled from
Utica to Buffalo to resist the friendship and the arguments of Dean
Richmond. It cannot be said that he had outlived ambition. He
possessed wealth, he was advancing in his political career, and he
aspired to higher honours, but he did not desire to become governor
again, even though the party indicated a willingness to follow his
leadership and give him free rein to inaugurate such a policy as his
wisdom and conservatism might dictate. He clearly recognised the
difficulties in the way. He had taken ultra ground against the Federal
Administration, opposing emancipation, denouncing arbitrary arrests,
and expressing the belief that the North could not subjugate the
South; yet he would be powerless to give life to his own views, or to
modify Lincoln's proposed conduct of the war. The President, having
been elected to serve until March, 1865, would not tolerate
interference with his plans and purposes, so that an opposition
Governor, regardless of grievances or their cause, would be compelled
to furnish troops and to keep the peace. Hatred of conscription would
be no excuse for non-action in case of a draft riot, and indignation
over summary arrests could in nowise limit the exercise of such
arbitrary methods. To be governor under such conditions, therefore,
meant constant embarrassment, if not unceasing humiliation. These
reasons were carefully presented to Richmond. Moreover, Seymour was
conscious of inherent defects of temperament. He did not belong to the
class of politicians, described by Victor Hugo, who mistake a
weather-cock for a flag. He was a gentleman of culture, of public
experience, and of moral purpose, representing the best quality of his
party; but possessed of a sensitive and eager temper, he was too often
influenced by the men immediately about him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.39" id="Page_iii.39">iii. 39</a></span> too often inclined
to have about him men whose influence did not strengthen his own
better judgment.</p>

<p>Richmond knew of this weakness and regretted it, but the man of iron,
grasping the political situation with the shrewdness of a phenomenally
successful business man, wanted a candidate who could win. It was
plain to him that the Republican party, divided on the question of
emancipation and weakened by arbitrary arrests, a policy that many
people bitterly resented, could be beaten by a candidate who added
exceptional popularity to a promised support of the war and a vigorous
protest against government methods. Dix, he knew, would stand with the
President; Seymour would criticise, and with sureness of aim arouse
opposition. While Richmond, therefore, listened respectfully to
Seymour's reasons for declining the nomination, he was deaf to all
entreaty, insisting that as the party had honoured him when he wanted
office, he must now honour the party when it needed him. Besides, he
declared that Sanford E. Church, whom Seymour favoured, could not be
elected.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Having gained the Oneidan's consent, Richmond exercised
his adroit methods of packing conventions, and thus opened the way for
Seymour's unanimous nomination by making the Constitutional Union
convention the voice of one crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p>To a majority of the Democratic party Seymour's selection appealed
with something of historic pride. It recalled other days in the
beginning of his career, and inspired the hope that the peace which
reigned in the fifties, and the power that the Democracy then wielded,
might, under his leadership, again return to bless their party by
checking a policy that was rapidly introducing a new order of things.
After his nomination, therefore, voices became hoarse with long
continued cheering. For a few minutes the assembly surrendered to the
noise and confusion which characterise a more modern convention, and
only the presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.40" id="Page_iii.40">iii. 40</a></span> nominee and the announcement that he would
speak brought men to order.</p>

<p>Seymour, as was his custom, came carefully prepared. In his party he
now had no rival. Not since DeWitt Clinton crushed the Livingstons in
1807, and Martin Van Buren swept the State in 1828, did one man so
completely dominate a political organisation, and in his arraignment
of the Radicals he emulated the partisan rather than the patriot. He
spoke respectfully of the President, insisting that he should &quot;be
treated with the respect due to his position as the representative of
the dignity and honor of the American people,&quot; and declaring that
&quot;with all our powers of mind and person, we mean to support the
Constitution and uphold the Union;&quot; but in his bitter denunciation of
the Administration he confused the general policy of conducting a war
with mistakes in awarding government contracts. To him an honest
difference of opinion upon constitutional questions was as corrupt and
reprehensible as dishonest practices in the departments at Washington.
He condemned emancipation as &quot;a proposal for the butchery of women and
children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder,
which would invoke the interference of civilised Europe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The convention thought seriously of making this speech the party
platform. But A.P. Laning, declining to surrender the prerogative of
the resolutions committee, presented a brief statement of principles,
&quot;pledging the Democracy to continue united in its support of the
Government, and to use all legitimate means to suppress rebellion,
restore the Union as it was, and maintain the Constitution as it is.&quot;
It also denounced &quot;the illegal, unconstitutional, and arbitrary
arrests of citizens of the State as unjustifiable,&quot; declaring such
arrests a usurpation and a crime, and insisting upon the liberty of
speech and the freedom of the press.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.41" id="Page_iii.41">iii. 41</a></span></p>
<p>The speech of Seymour, as displeasing to many War Democrats as it was
satisfactory to the Peace faction, at once aroused conservative
Republicans, and Weed and Raymond, backed by Seward, favored the
policy of nominating John A. Dix. Seward had distinguished himself as
one of the more conservative members of the Cabinet. After settling
into the belief that Lincoln &quot;is the best of us&quot;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> his ambition
centered in the support of the President, and whatever aid he could
render in helping the country to a better understanding of the
Administration's aims and wishes was generously if not always adroitly
performed. He did not oppose the abolition of slavery. On the
contrary, his clear discernment exhibited its certain destruction if
the rebellion continued; but he opposed blending emancipation with a
prosecution of the war, preferring to meet the former as the necessity
for it arose rather than precipitate an academic discussion which
would divide Republicans and give the Democrats an issue.</p>

<p>When Lincoln, on July 22, 1862, announced to his Cabinet a
determination to issue an emancipation proclamation, the Secretary
questioned its expediency only as to the time of its publication. &quot;The
depression of the public mind consequent upon our repeated reverses,&quot;
he said, &quot;is so great that I fear the effect of so important a
step.... I suggest, sir, that you postpone its issue until you can
give it to the country supported by military success, instead of
issuing it, as would be the case now, upon the greatest disasters of
the war.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Seward's view was adopted, and in place of the
proclamation appeared the Executive Order of July 22, the
unenforcement of which Greeley had so fiercely criticised in his
&quot;Prayer of Twenty Millions.&quot; Thurlow Weed, who, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.42" id="Page_iii.42">iii. 42</a></span> June, had returned
from London heavily freighted with good results for the Union
accomplished by his influence with leading Englishmen, held the
opinion of Seward. Raymond had also made the <i>Times</i> an able defender
of the President's policy, and although not violent in its opposition
to the attitude of the Radicals, it never ceased its efforts to
suppress agitation of the slavery question.</p>

<p>In its purpose to nominate Dix the New York <i>Herald</i> likewise bore a
conspicuous part. It had urged his selection upon the Democrats,
declaring him stronger than Seymour. It now urged him upon the
Republicans, insisting that he was stronger than Wadsworth.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This
was also the belief of Weed, whose sagacity as to the strength of
political leaders was rarely at fault.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> On the contrary, Governor
Morgan expressed the opinion that &quot;Wadsworth will be far more
available than any one yet mentioned as my successor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Wadsworth's
service at the battle of Bull Run had been distinguished. &quot;Gen.
McDowell told us on Monday,&quot; wrote Thurlow Weed, &quot;that Major Wadsworth
rendered him the most important service before, during, and after
battle. From others we have learned that after resisting the stampede,
earnestly but ineffectually, he remained to the last moment aiding the
wounded and encouraging surgeons to remain on the field as many of
them did.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Wadsworth's subsequent insistence that the Army of the
Potomac, then commanded by McClellan, could easily crush the
Confederates, who, in his opinion, did not number over 50,000<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, had
again brought his name conspicuously before the country. Moreover,
since the 8th of March he had commanded the forces in and about
Washington, and had acted as Stanton's adviser in the conduct of the
war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.43" id="Page_iii.43">iii. 43</a></span></p><p>For twenty years Wadsworth had not been a stranger to the people of
New York. His vigorous defence of Silas Wright gave him a warm place
in the hearts of Barnburners, and his name, after the formation of the
Republican party, became a household word among members of that young
organisation. Besides, his neighbours had exploited his character for
generosity. The story of the tenant who got a receipt for rent and one
hundred dollars in money because the accidental killing of his oxen in
the midst of harvest had diminished his earning capacity, seemed to be
only one of many similar acts. In 1847 his farm had furnished a
thousand bushels of corn to starving Ireland. Moreover, he had endowed
institutions of learning, founded school libraries, and turned the
houses of tenants into homes of college students. But the Radicals'
real reason for making him their candidate was his &quot;recognition of the
truth that slavery is the implacable enemy of our National life, and
that the Union can only be saved by grappling directly and boldly with
its deadly foe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Prompted by this motive his supporters used all the methods known to
managing politicians to secure a majority of the delegates. Lincoln's
emancipation proclamation, published on September 23, five days after
the battle of Antietam, greatly strengthened them. They hailed the
event as their victory. It gave substance, too, to the Wadsworth
platform that &quot;the Union must crush out slavery, or slavery will
destroy the Union.&quot; Reinforced by such an unexpected ally, it was well
understood before the day of the convention that in spite of the
appeals of Weed and Raymond, and of the wishes of Seward and the
President, the choice of the Radicals would be nominated. Wadsworth
was not averse. He had an itching for public life. In 1856 his
stubborn play for governor and his later contest for a seat in the
United States Senate had characterised him as an office-seeker. But
whether running for office himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.44" id="Page_iii.44">iii. 44</a></span> or helping some one else, he was
a fighter whom an opponent had reason to fear.</p>

<p>The Republican Union convention, as it was called, assembled at
Syracuse on September 25. Henry J. Raymond became its president, and
with characteristic directness made a vigorous reply to Seymour,
declaring that &quot;Jefferson Davis himself could not have planned a
speech better calculated, under all the circumstances of the case, to
promote his end to embarrass the Government of the United States and
strengthen the hands of those who are striving for its overthrow.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Then William Curtis Noyes read a letter from Governor Morgan declining
renomination.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The Governor had made a creditable executive,
winning the respect of conservatives in both parties, and although the
rule against a third term had become firmly established in a State
that had tolerated it but once since the days of Tompkins and DeWitt
Clinton, the propriety of making a further exception appealed to the
public with manifest approval. &quot;But this,&quot; Weed said, &quot;did not suit
the <i>Tribune</i> and a class of politicians with whom it sympathised.
They demanded a candidate with whom abolition is the paramount
consideration.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Morgan's letter created a ripple of applause,
after which the presentation of Wadsworth's name aroused an enthusiasm
of longer duration than had existed at Albany. Nevertheless, Charles
G. Myers of St. Lawrence did not hesitate to speak for &quot;a more
available candidate at the present time.&quot; Then, raising his voice
above the whisperings of dissent, he named John A. Dix, &quot;who, while
Seymour was howling for peace and compromise,&quot; said the speaker,
&quot;ordered the first man shot that hauled down the American flag.&quot;
Raymond, in his speech earlier in the afternoon, had quoted the
historic despatch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.45" id="Page_iii.45">iii. 45</a></span> a well-balanced sentence, with the accent and
inflection of a trained orator; but in giving it an idiomatic,
thrilling ring in contrast with Seymour's record, Myers suddenly threw
the convention into wild, continued cheering, until it seemed as if
the noise of a moment before would be exceeded by the genuine and
involuntary outburst of patriotic emotion. A single ballot, however,
giving Wadsworth an overwhelming majority, showed that the Radicals
owned the convention.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Parke Godwin of Queens, from the committee on resolutions, presented
the platform. Among other issues it urged the most vigorous
prosecution of the war; hailed, with the profoundest satisfaction, the
emancipation proclamation; and expressed pride in the knowledge that
the Republic's only enemies &quot;are the savages of the West, the rebels
of the South, their sympathisers and supporters of the North, and the
despots of Europe.&quot;</p>

<p>The campaign opened with unexampled bitterness. Seymour's convention
speech inflamed the Republican party, and its press, recalling his
address at the Peace convention in January, 1861, seemed to uncork its
pent-up indignation. The <i>Tribune</i> pronounced him a &quot;consummate
demagogue,&quot; &quot;radically dishonest,&quot; and the author of sentiments that
&quot;will be read throughout the rebel States with unalloyed delight,&quot;
since &quot;their whole drift tends to encourage treason and paralyse the
arm of those who strike for the Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It disclosed Seymour's
intimate relations with &quot;Vallandigham and the school of Democrats who
do not disguise their sympathy with traitors nor their hostility to
war,&quot; and predicted &quot;that, if elected, Jeff Davis will re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.46" id="Page_iii.46">iii. 46</a></span>gard his
success as a triumph.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Odious comparisons also became frequent.
Wadsworth at Bull Run was contrasted with Seymour's prediction that
the Union's foes could not be subdued.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Seymour's supporters, it
was said, believed in recognising the independence of the South, or in
a restored Union with slavery conserved, while Wadsworth's champions
thought rebellion a wicked and wanton conspiracy against human
liberty, to be crushed by the most effective measures.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Raymond
declared that &quot;every vote given for Wadsworth is a vote for loyalty,
and every vote given for Seymour is a vote for treason.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>To these thrusts the Democratic press replied with no less acrimony,
speaking of Wadsworth as &quot;a malignant, abolition disorganiser,&quot; whose
service in the field was &quot;very brief,&quot; whose command in Washington was
&quot;behind fortifications,&quot; and whose capacity was &quot;limited to attacks
upon his superior officers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The <i>Herald</i> declared him &quot;as arrant
an aristocrat as any Southern rebel. The slaveholder,&quot; it said, &quot;lives
upon his plantation, which his ancestors begged, cheated, or stole
from the Indians. Wadsworth lives upon his immense Genesee farms,
which his ancestors obtained from the Indians in precisely the same
way. The slaveholder has a number of negroes who raise crops for him,
and whom he clothes, feeds, and lodges. Wadsworth has a number of
labourers on his farms, who support him by raising his crops or paying
him rent. The slaveholder, having an independent fortune and nothing
to do, joins the army, or runs for office. Wadsworth, in exactly the
same circumstances, does exactly the same thing. Wadsworth, therefore,
is quite as much an aristocrat as the slaveholder, and cares quite as
much for himself and quite as little for the people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Democrats
everywhere endeavoured to limit the issue to the two opposing
candidates, claiming that Seymour, in conjunction with all
conservative men, stood for a vigorous prosecution of the war to save
the Union, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.47" id="Page_iii.47">iii. 47</a></span> Wadsworth, desiring its prosecution for the
destruction of slavery, believed the Union of secondary consideration.</p>

<p>Campaign oratory, no longer softened by the absence of strict party
lines, throbbed feverishly with passion and ugly epithet. The
strategical advantage lay with Seymour, who made two speeches. Dean
Richmond, alarmed at the growing strength of the war spirit, urged him
to put more &quot;powder&quot; into his Brooklyn address than he used at the
ratification meeting, held in New York City on October 13; but he
declined to cater &quot;to war Democrats,&quot; contenting himself with an
amplification of his convention speech. &quot;God knows I love my country,&quot;
he said; &quot;I would count my life as nothing, if I could but save the
nation's life.&quot; He resented with much feeling Raymond's electioneering
statement that a vote for him was one for treason.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> &quot;Recognising at
this moment as we do,&quot; he continued, &quot;that the destinies, the honour,
and the glory of our country hang poised upon the conflict in the
battlefield, we tender to the Government no conditional support&quot; to
put down &quot;this wicked and mighty rebellion.&quot; Once, briefly, and
without bitterness, he referred to the emancipation proclamation, but
he again bitterly arraigned the Administration for its infractions of
the Constitution, its deception as to the strength of the South, and
the corruption in its departments.</p>

<p>Seymour's admirers manifested his tendencies more emphatically than he
did himself, until denunciation of treason and insistence upon a
vigorous prosecution of the war yielded to an indictment of the
Radicals. The shibboleth of these declaimers was arbitrary arrests.
Two days after the edict of emancipation (September 24) the President
issued a proclamation ordering the arrest, without benefit of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, of all who &quot;discouraged enlistments,&quot; or were guilty of &quot;any
disloyal practice&quot; which afforded &quot;aid and comfort to the rebels.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
This gave rise to an opinion that he intended to &quot;suppress free
discussion of political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.48" id="Page_iii.48">iii. 48</a></span> subjects,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and every orator warned the
people that Wadsworth's election meant the arrest and imprisonment of
his political opponents. &quot;If chosen governor,&quot; said the <i>Herald</i>, &quot;he
will have his adversaries consigned to dungeons and their property
seized and confiscated under the act of Congress.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In accepting an
invitation to speak at Rome, John Van Buren, quick to see the humour
of the situation as well as the vulnerable point of the Radicals,
telegraphed that he would &quot;arrive at two o'clock&#8212;if not in Fort
Lafayette.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>To the delight of audiences John Van Buren, after two years of
political inactivity, broke his silence. He had earnestly and perhaps
sincerely advocated the nomination of John A. Dix, but after Seymour's
selection he again joined the ranks of the Softs and took the stump.
Among other appointments he spoke with Seymour at the New York
ratification meeting, and again at the Brooklyn rally on October 22.
Something remained of the old-time vigour of the professional
gladiator, but compared with his Barnburner work he seemed what Byron
called &quot;an extinct volcano.&quot; He ran too heedlessly into a bitter
criticism of Wadsworth, based upon an alleged conversation he could
not substantiate, and into an acrimonious attack upon Lincoln's
conduct of the war, predicated upon a private letter of General Scott,
the possession of which he did not satisfactorily account for. The
<i>Tribune</i>, referring to his campaign as &quot;a rhetorical spree,&quot; called
him a &quot;buffoon,&quot; a &quot;political harlequin,&quot; a &quot;repeater of mouldy
jokes,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and in bitter terms denounced his &quot;low comedy performance
at Tammany,&quot; his &quot;double-shuffle dancing at Mozart Hall,&quot; his

proud of, and al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.49" id="Page_iii.49">iii. 49</a></span>though Van Buren succeeded in stirring up the
advertising sensations which he craved, he did not escape without
wounds that left deep scars. &quot;Prince John makes a statement,&quot; says the
<i>Herald</i>, &quot;accusing Charles King of slandering the wife of Andrew
Jackson; King retorts by calling the Prince a liar; the poets of the
<i>Post</i> take up the case and broadly hint that the Prince's private
history shows that he has not lived the life of a saint; the Prince
replies that he has half a mind to walk into the private antecedents
of Wadsworth, which, it is said, would disclose some scenes
exceedingly rich; while certain other Democrats, indignant at
Raymond's accusations of treason against Seymour, threaten to reveal
his individual history, hinting, by the way, that it would show him to
have been heretofore a follower of that fussy philosopher of the
twelfth century, Abelard&#8212;not in philosophy, however, but in
sentiment, romance, and some other things.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Wherever Van Buren spoke Daniel S. Dickinson followed. His admirers,
the most extreme Radicals, cheered his speeches wildly, their fun
relieving the prosaic rigour of an issue that to one side seemed
forced by Northern treachery, to the other to threaten the gravest
peril to the country. It is difficult to exaggerate the tension. Party
violence ran high and the result seemed in doubt. Finally,
conservatives appealed to both candidates to retire in favour of John
A. Dix,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and on October 20 an organisation, styling itself the
Federal Union, notified the General that its central committee had
nominated him for governor, and that a State Convention, called to
meet at Cooper Institute on the 28th, would ratify the nomination. To
this summons, Dix, without declining a nomination, replied from
Maryland that he could not leave his duties &quot;to be drawn into any
party strife.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This settled the question of a compromise
candidate.</p>

<p>Elections in the October States did not encourage the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.50" id="Page_iii.50">iii. 50</a></span> Radicals.
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana voiced the sentiments of the
opposition, defeating Galusha A. Grow, speaker of the House, and
seriously threatening the Radical majority in Congress. This
retrogression, accounted for by the absence of soldiers who could not
vote,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> suggested trouble in New York, and to offset the influence
of the Seymour rally in Brooklyn a great audience at Cooper Institute
listened to a brief letter from the Secretary of State, and to a
speech from Wadsworth. Seward did not encourage the soldier candidate.
The rankling recollection of Wadsworth's opposition at Chicago in 1860
stifled party pride as well as patriotism, and although the <i>Herald</i>
thought it &quot;brilliant and sarcastic,&quot; it emphasised Wadsworth's
subsequent statement that &quot;Seward was dead against me throughout the
campaign.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Wadsworth's canvass was confined to a single speech. He had been
absent from the State fifteen months, and although not continuously at
the front there was something inexcusably ungenerous in the taunts of
his opponents that he had served &quot;behind fortifications.&quot; His superb
conduct at Bull Run entitled him to better treatment. But his party
was wholly devoted to him, and &quot;amid a hurricane of approbation&quot;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
he mingled censure of Seymour with praise of Lincoln, and the
experience of a brave soldier with bitter criticism of an unpatriotic
press. It was not the work of a trained public speaker. It lacked
poise, phrase, and deliberation. But what it wanted in manner it made
up in fire and directness, giving an emotional and loyal audience
abundant opportunity to explode into long-continued cheering.
Thoughtful men who were not in any sense political partisans gave
careful heed to his words. He stood for achievement. He brought the
great struggle nearer home, and men listened as to one with a message
from the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.51" id="Page_iii.51">iii. 51</a></span> of patriotic sacrifices. The radical newspapers broke
into a chorus of applause. The Radicals themselves were delighted. The
air rung with praises of the courage and spirit of their candidate,
and if here and there the faint voice of a Conservative suggested that
emancipation was premature and arbitrary arrests were unnecessary, a
shout of offended patriotism drowned the ignoble utterance.</p>

<p>Wadsworth and his party were too much absorbed in the zeal of their
cause not to run counter to the prejudices of men less earnest and
less self-forgetting. In a contest of such bitterness they were
certain to make enemies, whose hostilities would be subtle and
enduring, and the October elections showed that the inevitable
reaction was setting in. Military failure and increasing debt made the
avowed policy of emancipation more offensive. People were getting
tired of bold action without achievement in the field, and every
opponent of the Administration became a threnodist. However,
independent papers which strongly favoured Seymour believed in
Wadsworth's success. &quot;Seymour's antecedents are against him,&quot; said the
<i>Herald</i>. &quot;Wadsworth, radical as he is, will be preferred by the
people to a Democrat who is believed to be in favour of stopping the
war; because, whatever Wadsworth's ideas about the negro may be, they
are only as dust in the balance compared with his hearty and earnest
support of the war and the Administration.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> This was the belief
of the Radicals,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and upon them the news of Seymour's election by
over 10,000 majority fell with a sickening thud.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Raymond declared
it &quot;a vote of want of confidence in the President;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Wadsworth
thought Seward did it;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Weed suggested that Wadsworth held &quot;too
extreme party views;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and Greeley insisted that it was &quot;a gang of
corrupt Republican politicians, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.52" id="Page_iii.52">iii. 52</a></span> failing to rule the nominating
convention, took revenge on its patriotic candidate by secretly
supporting the Democratic nominee.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> But the dominant reason was
what George William Curtis called &quot;the mad desperation of
reaction,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> which showed its influence in other States as well as
in New York. That Wadsworth's personality had little, if anything, to
do with his overthrow was further evidenced by results in
congressional districts, the Democrats carrying seventeen out of
thirty-one. Even Francis Kernan carried the Oneida district against
Conkling. The latter was undoubtedly embarrassed by personal enemies
who controlled the Welsh vote, but the real cause of his defeat was
military disasters, financial embarrassments, and the emancipation
proclamation. &quot;All our reverses, our despondence, our despairs,&quot; said
Curtis, &quot;bring us to the inevitable issue, shall not the blacks strike
for their freedom?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<h2>THURLOW WEED TRIMS HIS SAILS</h2>

<h2>1863</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> political reaction in 1862 tied the two parties in the
Legislature. In the Senate, elected in 1861, the Republicans had
twelve majority, but in the Assembly each party controlled sixty-four
members. This deadlocked the election of a speaker, and seriously
jeopardized the selection of a United States senator in place of
Preston King, since a joint-convention of the two houses, under the
law as it then existed, could not convene until some candidate
controlled a majority in each branch.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> It increased the
embarrassment that either a Republican or Democrat must betray his
party to break the deadlock.</p>

<p>Chauncey M. Depew was the choice of the Republicans for speaker. But
the caucus, upon the threat of a single Republican to bolt,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
selected Henry Sherwood of Steuben. After seventy-seven ballots Depew
was substituted for Sherwood. By this time Timothy C. Callicot, a
Brooklyn Democrat, refused longer to vote for Gilbert Dean, the
Democratic nominee. Deeply angered by such apostasy John D. Van Buren
and Saxton Smith, the Democratic leaders, offered Depew eight votes.
Later in the evening Depew was visited by Callicot, who promised, if
the Republicans would support him for speaker, to vote for John A. Dix
for senator and thus break the senatorial deadlock. It was a trying
position for Depew. The speakership was regarded as even a greater
honor then than it is now, and to a gifted young man of twenty-nine
its power and prestige appealed with tremen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.54" id="Page_iii.54">iii. 54</a></span>dous force. Van Buren's
proposition would elect him; Callicot's would put him in eclipse.
Nevertheless, Depew unselfishly submitted the two proposals to his
Republican associates, who decided to lose the speakership and elect a
United States senator.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The Democrats, alarmed at this sudden and successful flank movement,
determined to defeat by disorderly proceedings what their leaders
could not prevent by strategy, and with the help of thugs who filled
the floor and galleries of the Assembly Chamber, they instigated a
riot scarcely equalled in the legislative history of modern times.
Boisterous threats, display of pistols, savage abuse of Callicot, and
refusals to allow the balloting to proceed continued for six days,
subsiding at last after the Governor, called upon to protect a
law-making body, promised to use force. Finally, on January 26,
nineteen days after the session opened, Callicot, on the ninety-third
ballot, received two majority. This opened the way for the election of
a Republican United States senator.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley had hoped, in the event of Wadsworth's success, to ride
into the Senate upon &quot;an abolition whirlwind.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> He now wished to
elect Preston King or Daniel S. Dickinson. King had made a creditable
record in the Senate. Although taking little part in debate, his
judgment upon questions of governmental policy, indicating an accurate
knowledge of men and remarkable familiarity with details, commended
him as a safe adviser, especially in political emergencies. But Weed,
abandoning his old St. Lawrence friend, joined Seward in the support
of Edwin D. Morgan.</p>

<p>Morgan had a decided taste for political life. When a grocer, living
in Connecticut, he had served in the city council of Hartford, and
soon after gaining a residence in New York, he entered its Board of
Aldermen. Then he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.55" id="Page_iii.55">iii. 55</a></span>came State senator, commissioner of immigration,
chairman of the National Republican Committee, and finally governor.
Besides wielding an influence acquired in two gubernatorial terms, he
combined the qualities of a shrewd politician with those of a merchant
prince willing to spend money.</p>

<p>The stoutest opposition to Morgan came from extreme Radicals who
distrusted him, and in trying to compass his defeat half a dozen
candidates played prominent parts. Charles B. Sedgwick of Syracuse, an
all-around lawyer of rare ability, whose prominence as a persuasive
speaker began in the Free-Soil campaign of 1848, and who had served
with distinction for four years in Congress, proved acceptable to a
few Radicals and several Conservatives.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Henry J. Raymond, also
pressed by the opponents of Morgan, attracted a substantial following,
while David Dudley Field, Ward Hunt, and Henry R. Selden controlled
two or three votes each. Nevertheless, a successful combination could
not be established, and on the second formal ballot Morgan received a
large majority. The remark of Assemblyman Truman, on a motion to make
the nomination unanimous, evidenced the bitterness of the contest. &quot;I
believe we are rewarding a man,&quot; he said, &quot;who placed the knife at the
throat of the Union ticket last fall and slaughtered it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The Democrats presented Erastus Corning of Albany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.56" id="Page_iii.56">iii. 56</a></span> then a member of
Congress. Like Morgan, Corning was wealthy. Like Morgan, too, he had a
predilection for politics, having served as alderman, state senator,
mayor, and congressman. He belonged to a class of business men whose
experience and ability, when turned to public affairs, prove of
decided value to their State and country. &quot;We should be glad,&quot; said
the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;to see more men of Mr. Corning's social and business
position brought forward for Congress and the Legislature.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The
first ballot, in joint convention, gave Morgan 86 to 70 for Corning,
Speaker Callicot voting for John A. Dix, and one fiery Radical for
Daniel S. Dickinson. Thus did Thurlow Weed score another victory.
Greeley was willing to make any combination. Raymond, Sedgwick, Ward
Hunt, and even David Dudley Field would quickly have appealed to him.
The deft hand of Weed, however, if not the money of Morgan, prevented
combinations until the Governor, as a second choice, controlled the
election.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This success resulted in a combination of Democrats and
conservative Republicans, giving Weed the vast patronage of the New
York canals.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only coincidental that Weed's withdrawal from the
<i>Evening Journal</i> concurred with Morgan's election, but his farewell
editorial, written while gloom and despond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.57" id="Page_iii.57">iii. 57</a></span>ency filled the land,
indicated that he unerringly read the signs of the times. &quot;I differ
widely with my party about the best means of crushing the rebellion,&quot;
he said. &quot;I can neither impress others with my views nor surrender my
own solemn convictions. The alternative of living in strife with those
whom I have esteemed, or withdrawing, is presented. I have not
hesitated in choosing the path of peace as the path of duty. If those
who differ with me are right, and the country is carried safely
through its present struggle, all will be well and 'nobody
hurt.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> This did not mean that Weed &quot;has ceased to be a
Republican,&quot; as Greeley put it,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> but that, while refusing to
become an Abolitionist of the Chase and Sumner and Greeley type, he
declined longer to urge his conservative views upon readers who
possessed the spirit of Radicals. Years afterward he wrote that &quot;from
the outbreak of the rebellion, I knew no party, nor did I care for any
except the party of the Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>At the time of his retirement from the <i>Journal</i>, Weed was sixty-six
years of age, able-bodied, rich, independent, and satisfied if not
surfeited. &quot;So far as all things personal are concerned,&quot; he said, &quot;my
work is done.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Yet a trace of unhappiness revealed itself.
Perfect peace did not come with the possession of wealth.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Moreover, his political course had grieved and separated friends. For
thirty years he looked forward with pleasurable emotions to the time
when, released from the cares of journalism, he might return to
Rochester, spending his remaining days on a farm, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.58" id="Page_iii.58">iii. 58</a></span> suburbs of
that city, near the banks of the Genesee River; but in 1863 he found
his old friends so hostile, charging him with the defeat of Wadsworth,
that he abandoned the project and sought a home in New York.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>For several years Weed had made his political headquarters in that
city. Indeed, No. 12 Astor House was as famous in its day as 49
Broadway became during the subsequent leadership of Thomas C. Platt.
It was the cradle of the &quot;Amens&quot; forty years before the Fifth Avenue
Hotel became the abode of that remarkable organization. From 1861 to
1865, owing to the enormous political patronage growing out of the
war, the lobbies of the Astor House were crowded with politicians from
all parts of New York, making ingress and egress almost impossible. In
the midst of this throng sat Thurlow Weed, cool and patient,
possessing the keen judgment of men so essential to leadership. &quot;When
I was organizing the Internal Revenue Office in 1862-3,&quot; wrote George
S. Boutwell, &quot;Mr. Weed gave me information in regard to candidates for
office in the State of New York, including their relations to the
factions that existed, with as much fairness as he could have
commanded if he had had no relation to either one.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Although opposed to the course of the Radicals, Weed sternly rebuked
those, now called Copperheads,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> who endeavored to force peace by
paralysing the arm of the government. Their denunciation of arrests
and of the suspension of <i>habeas corpus</i> gradually included the
discouragement of enlistments, the encouragement of desertion, and
resistance to the draft, until, at last, the spirit of opposition
invaded halls of legislation as well as public meetings and the press.</p>

<p>To check this display of disloyalty the Union people, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.59" id="Page_iii.59">iii. 59</a></span>gardless of
party, formed loyal or Union League clubs in the larger cities, whose
densely packed meetings commanded the ablest speakers of the country.
John Van Buren, fully aroused to the seditious trend of peace
advocates, evidenced again the power that made him famous in 1848. In
his inimitable style, with admirable temper and freshness, he poured
his scathing sarcasm upon the authors of disloyal sentiments, until
listeners shouted with delight. The <i>Tribune</i>, forgetful of his
flippant work in the preceding year, accorded him the highest praise,
while strong men, with faces wet with tears, thanked God that this
Achilles of the Democrats spoke for the Republic with the trumpet
tones and torrent-like fluency that had formerly made the name of
Barnburner a terror to the South. Van Buren was not inconsistent.
While favouring a vigorous prosecution of the war he had severely
criticised arbitrary arrests and other undemocratic methods, but when
&quot;little men of little souls,&quot; as he called them, attempted to control
the great party for illegal purposes, his patriotism flashed out in
the darkness like a revolving light on a rocky coast.</p>

<p>The call of the Loyal League also brought James T. Brady from his law
office. Unlike Dickinson, Brady did not approve the teachings or the
methods of the Radicals, neither had he like Van Buren supported
Seymour. Moreover, he had refused to take office from Tammany, or to
accept nomination from a Democratic State convention. However, when
the enemies of the Government seemed likely to carry all before them,
he spoke for the Union like one divinely inspired. Indeed, it may be
said with truth that the only ray of hope piercing the gloom and
suspense in the early months of 1863 came from the brilliant outbursts
of patriotism heard at the meetings of the Union League clubs.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> &quot;I
pray that my name may be enrolled in that league,&quot; wrote Seward. &quot;I
would prefer that distinction to any honour my fellow-citizens could
bestow upon me. If the country lives, as I trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.60" id="Page_iii.60">iii. 60</a></span> it will, let me be
remembered among those who laboured to save it. The diploma will grow
in value as years roll away.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<h2>GOVERNOR SEYMOUR AND PRESIDENT LINCOLN</h2>

<h2>1863</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Horatio Seymour</span> did not become a member of the Union League, and his
inaugural message of January 7 gave no indication of a change of
heart. He spoke of his predecessor as having &quot;shown high capacity&quot; in
the performance of his duties; he insisted that &quot;we must emulate the
conduct of our fathers, and show obedience to constituted authorities,
and respect for legal and constitutional obligations;&quot; he demanded
economy and integrity; and he affirmed that &quot;under no circumstances
can the division of the Union be conceded. We will put forth every
exertion of power; we will use every policy of conciliation; we will
hold out every inducement to the people of the South, consistent with
honour, to return to their allegiance; we will guarantee them every
right, every consideration demanded by the Constitution, and by that
fraternal regard which must prevail in a common country; but we can
never voluntarily consent to the breaking up of the Union of these
States, or the destruction of the Constitution.&quot; With his usual
severity he opposed arbitrary arrests, deemed martial law destructive
of the rights of States, and declared that the abolition of slavery
for the purpose of restoring the Union would convert the government
into a military despotism.</p>

<p>&quot;It has been assumed,&quot; he said, &quot;that this war will end in the
ascendency of the views of one or the other of the extremes in our
country. Neither will prevail. This is the significance of the late
elections. The determination of the great Central and Western States
is to defend the rights of the States, the rights of individuals, and
to restore our Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.62" id="Page_iii.62">iii. 62</a></span> as it was. We must not wear out the lives of our
soldiers by a war to carry out vague theories. The policy of
subjugation and extermination means not only the destruction of the
lives and property of the South, but also the waste of the blood and
treasure of the North. There is but one way to save us from
demoralisation, discord, and repudiation. No section must be
disorganised. All must be made to feel that the mighty efforts we are
making to save our Union are stimulated by a purpose to restore peace
and prosperity in every section. If it is true that slavery must be
abolished by force; that the South must be held in military
subjection; that four millions of negroes must be under the management
of authorities at Washington at the public expense; then, indeed, we
must endure the waste of our armies, further drains upon our
population, and still greater burdens of debt. We must convert our
government into a military despotism. The mischievous opinion that in
this contest the North must subjugate and destroy the South to save
our Union has weakened the hopes of our citizens at home, and
destroyed confidence in our success abroad.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Although this message failed to recognise the difference between a
peaceable South in the Union and a rebellious South attempting to
destroy the Union, it is not easy, perhaps, to comprehend how the
acknowledged leader of the opposition, holding such views and relying
for support upon the peace sentiment of the country, could have said
much less. Yet the feeling must possess the student of history that a
consummate politician, possessing Seymour's ability and popularity,
might easily have divided with Lincoln the honor of crushing the
rebellion and thus have become his successor. The President recognized
this opportunity, saying to Weed that the &quot;Governor has greater power
just now for good than any other man in the country. He can wheel the
Democratic party into line, put down rebellion, and preserve the
government. Tell him for me that if he will render this service for
his country, I shall cheerfully make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.63" id="Page_iii.63">iii. 63</a></span> way for him as my
successor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Seymour's reply, if he made one, is not of record,
but Lincoln's message would scarcely appeal to one who disbelieved in
the North's ability to subjugate the South. Later in the spring the
President, unwilling to give the Governor up, wrote him a
characteristic note. &quot;You and I,&quot; said he, &quot;are, substantially,
strangers, and I write this chiefly that we may become better
acquainted. As to maintaining the nation's life and integrity, I
assume and believe there cannot be a difference of purpose between you
and me. If we should differ as to the means it is important that such
difference should be as small as possible; that it should not be
enhanced by unjust suspicions on one side or the other. In the
performance of my duty the co&#246;peration of your State, as that of
others, is needed,&#8212;in fact, is indispensable. This alone is a
sufficient reason why I should wish to be at a good understanding with
you. Please write me at least as long a letter as this, of course
saying in it just what you think fit.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to fathom the impression made upon Seymour by this
letter. The more cultivated Democrats about him entertained the belief
that Lincoln, somewhat uncouth and grotesque, was a weak though
well-meaning man, and the Governor doubtless held a similar opinion.
Moreover, he believed that the President, alarmed by the existence of
a conspiracy of prominent Republicans to force him from the White
House, sought to establish friendly relations that he might have an
anchor to windward.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> One can imagine the Governor, as the letter
lingered in his hand, smiling superciliously and wondering what manner
of man this Illinoisan is, who could say to a stranger what a little
boy frequently puts in his missive, &quot;Please write me at least as long
a letter as this.&quot; At all events, he treated the President very
cavalierly.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> On April 14, after delaying three weeks, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.64" id="Page_iii.64">iii. 64</a></span> wrote a
cold and guarded reply, promising to address him again after the
Legislature adjourned. &quot;In the meanwhile,&quot; he concluded, &quot;I assure you
that no political resentments, or no personal objects, will turn me
aside from the pathway I have marked out for myself. I intend to show
to those charged with the administration of public affairs a due
deference and respect, and to yield to them a just and generous
support in all measures they may adopt within the scope of their
constitutional powers. For the preservation of this Union I am ready
to make any sacrifice of interest, passion, or prejudice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Seymour never wrote the promised letter. His inaugural expressed his
honest convictions. He wanted no relations with a President who seemed
to prefer the abolition of slavery and the use of arbitrary methods. A
few days later, in vetoing a measure authorising soldiers to vote
while absent in the army, he again showed his personal antipathy,
charging the President with rewarding officers of high rank for
improperly interfering in State elections, while subordinate officers
were degraded &quot;for the fair exercise of their political rights at
their own homes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> John Hay did not err in saying &quot;there could be
no intimate understanding between two such men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>General Burnside's arrest of Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio (May,
1863) increased Seymour's aversion to the President. Burnside's act
lacked authority of law as well as the excuse of good judgment, and
although the President's change of sentence from imprisonment in Fort
Warren to banishment to the Southern Confederacy gave the proceeding a
humorous turn, the ugly fact remained that a citizen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.65" id="Page_iii.65">iii. 65</a></span> in the dead of
night, with haste, and upon the evidence of disguised and partisan
informers, had been rudely deprived of liberty without due process of
law. Thoughtful men who reverenced the safeguard known to civil
judicial proceedings were appalled. The Republican press of New York
thought it indefensible, while the opposition, with unprecedented
bitterness, again assailed the Administration. In a moment the whole
North was in a turmoil. Everywhere mass meetings, intemperate
speeches, and threats of violence inflamed the people. The basest
elements in New York City, controlling a public meeting called to
condemn the &quot;outrage,&quot; indicated how easily a reign of riot and
bloodshed might be provoked. To an assembly held in Albany on May 16,
at which Erastus Corning presided, Seymour addressed a letter
deploring the unfortunate event as a dishonour brought upon the
country by an utter disregard of the principles of civil liberty. &quot;It
is a fearful thing,&quot; he said, &quot;to increase the danger which now
overhangs us, by treating the law, the judiciary, and the authorities
of States with contempt. If this proceeding is approved by the
government and sanctioned by the people, it is not merely a step
toward revolution, it is revolution; it will not only lead to military
despotism, it establishes military despotism. In this respect it must
be accepted, or in this respect it must be rejected. If it is upheld
our liberties are overthrown.&quot; Then he grew bolder. &quot;The people of
this country now wait with the deepest anxiety the decision of the
Administration upon these acts. Having given it a generous support in
the conduct of the war, we now pause to see what kind of government it
is for which we are asked to pour out our blood and our treasure. The
action of the Administration will determine, in the minds of more than
one-half the people of the loyal States, whether this war is waged to
put down rebellion in the South or to destroy free institutions at the
North.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>At great length Lincoln replied to the resolutions forwarded by
Corning. &quot;In my own discretion,&quot; wrote the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.66" id="Page_iii.66">iii. 66</a></span> President, &quot;I do not know
whether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham.... I was
slow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees I have been forced
to regard as being within the exceptions of the Constitution and as
indispensable to the public safety.... I think the time not unlikely
to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather
than too many.... Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who
deserts, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces
him to desert? This is none the less injurious when effected by
getting a father, a brother, or friend into a public meeting and then
working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier
boy that he is fighting in a bad cause for a wicked administration and
contemptible government, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall
desert.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This argument, undoubtedly the strongest that could be
made in justification, found great favour with his party, but the
danger Seymour apprehended lay in the precedent. &quot;Wicked men ambitious
of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law,&quot; said Justice
Davis of the United States Supreme Court, in deciding a case of
similar character, &quot;may fill the place once occupied by Washington and
Lincoln, and if this right [of military arrest] is conceded, and the
calamities of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are
frightful to contemplate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Much as Seymour resented the arrest of Vallandigham, he did not allow
the incident to interfere with his official action, and to the
Secretary of War's call for aid when General Lee began his midsummer
invasion of Pennsylvania, he responded promptly: &quot;I will spare no
effort to send you troops at once,&quot; and true to his message he
forwarded nineteen regiments, armed and equipped for field service,
whose arrival brought confidence.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> But governed by the sinister
reason that influenced him earlier in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.67" id="Page_iii.67">iii. 67</a></span> year, he refused to
acknowledge the President's letter of thanks, preferring to express
his opinion of Administration methods unhindered by the exchange of
courtesies. This he did in a Fourth of July address, delivered at the
Academy of Music in New York City, in which he pleaded, not
passionately, not with the acrimony that ordinarily characterised his
speeches, but humbly, as if asking a despotic conqueror to return the
rights and liberty of which the people had been robbed. &quot;We only ask
freedom of speech,&#8212;the right to exercise all the franchises conferred
by the Constitution upon an American. Can you safely deny us these
things?&quot; Mingled also with pathetic appeals were joyless pictures of
the ravages of war, and cheerless glimpses into the future of a
Republic with its bulwarks of liberty torn away. &quot;We stand to-day,&quot; he
continued, &quot;amid new made graves; we stand to-day in a land filled
with mourning, and our soil is saturated with the blood of the
fiercest conflict of which history gives us an account. We can, if we
will, avert all these disasters and evoke a blessing. If we will do
what? Hold that Constitution, and liberties, and laws are suspended?
Will that restore them? Or shall we do as our fathers did under
circumstances of like trial, when they battled against the powers of a
crown? Did they say that liberty was suspended? Did they say that men
might be deprived of the right of trial by jury? Did they say that men
might be torn from their homes by midnight intruders?... If you would
save your country and your liberties, begin at the hearth-stone; begin
in your family circle; declare that their rights shall be held sacred;
and having once proclaimed your own rights, claim for your own State
that jurisdiction and that government which we, better than all
others, can exercise for ourselves, for we best know our own
interests.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>One week later, on Saturday, July 11, the draft began in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.68" id="Page_iii.68">iii. 68</a></span> the Ninth
Congressional District of New York, a portion of the city settled by
labourers, largely of foreign birth. These people, repeating the
information gained in neighbourhood discussions, violently denounced
the Conscription Act as illegal, claiming that the privilege of buying
an exemption on payment of $300 put &quot;the rich man's money against the
poor man's blood.&quot; City authorities apprehended trouble and State
officials were notified of the threatened danger, but only the police
held themselves in readiness. The Federal Government, in the absence
of a request from the Governor, very properly declined to make an
exception in the application of the law in New York on the mere
assumption that violence would occur. Besides, all available troops,
including most of the militia regiments, had been sent to
Pennsylvania, and to withdraw them would weaken the Federal lines
about Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The disturbance began at the corner of Forty-sixth Street and Third
Avenue, the rioters destroying the building in which the
provost-marshal was conducting the draft. By this time the mob, having
grown into an army, began to sack and murder. Prejudice against
negroes sent the rioters into hotels and restaurants after the
waiters, some of whom were beaten to death, while others, hanged on
trees and lamp-posts, were burned while dying. The coloured orphan
asylum, fortunately after its inmates had escaped, likewise became
fuel for the flames. The police were practically powerless. Street
cars and omnibuses ceased to run, shopkeepers barred their doors,
workmen dropped their tools, teamsters put up their horses, and for
three days all business was stopped. In the meantime Federal and State
authorities co&#246;perated to restore order. Governor Seymour, having
hastened from Long Branch, addressed a throng of men and boys from the
steps of the City Hall, calling them &quot;friends,&quot; and pleading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.69" id="Page_iii.69">iii. 69</a></span> with
them to desist. He also issued two proclamations, declaring the city
in a state of insurrection, and commanding all people to obey the laws
and the legal authorities. Finally, the militia regiments from
Pennsylvania began to arrive, and cannon and howitzers raked the
streets. These quieting influences, coupled with the publication of an
official notice that the draft had been suspended, put an end to the
most exciting experience of any Northern community during the war.</p>

<p>After the excitement the <i>Tribune</i> asserted that the riot resulted
from a widespread treasonable conspiracy,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and a letter, addressed
to the President, related the alleged confession of a well-known
politician, who, overcome with remorse, had revealed to the editors of
the <i>Tribune</i> the complicity of Seymour. Lincoln placed no reliance in
the story, &quot;for which,&quot; says Hay, &quot;there was no foundation in
fact;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> but Seymour's speech &quot;intimated,&quot; says the Lincoln
historian, &quot;that the draft justified the riot, and that if the rioters
would cease their violence the draft should be stopped.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> James B.
Fry, provost-marshal general, substantially endorsed this view. &quot;While
the riot was going on,&quot; he says, &quot;Governor Seymour insisted on Colonel
Nugent announcing a suspension of the draft. The draft had already
been stopped by violence. The announcement was urged by the Governor,
no doubt, because he thought it would allay the excitement; but it
was, under the circumstances, making a concession to the mob, and
endangering the successful enforcement of the law of the land.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Of the four reports of Seymour's speech, published the morning after
its delivery, no two are alike.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Three, however, concur in his use
of the word &quot;friends,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.70" id="Page_iii.70">iii. 70</a></span> agree that he spoke of trying to
secure a postponement of the draft that justice might be done. It was
a delicate position in which he placed himself, and one that ever
after gave him and his supporters much embarrassment and cause for
many apologies. Nevertheless, his action in nowise impugned his
patriotism. Assuming the riot had its inception in the belief which he
himself entertained, that the draft was illegal and unjust, he sought
by personal appeal to stay the destruction of life and property, and
if anyone in authority at that time had influence with the rioters and
their sympathisers it was Horatio Seymour, who probably accomplished
less than he hoped to.</p>

<p>Seymour's views in relation to the draft first appeared in August.
While the Federal authorities prepared the enrolment in June, the
Governor, although his co&#246;peration was sought, &quot;gave no assistance,&quot;
says Fry. &quot;In fact, so far as the government officers engaged in the
enrolment could learn, he gave the subject no attention.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> On the
day the drawing began, however, he became apprehensive of trouble and
sent his adjutant to Washington to secure a suspension of the draft,
but the records do not reveal the reasons presented by that officer.
Certainly no complaint was made as to the correctness of the enrolment
or the assignment of quotas.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Nevertheless, his delay taught him a
lesson, and when the Federal authorities notified him later that the
drawing would be resumed in August, he lost no time in beginning the
now historic correspondence with the President. His letter of August 3
asked that the suspension of the draft be continued to enable the
State officials to correct the enrolment, and to give the United
States Supreme Court opportunity to pass upon the constitutionality of
the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.71" id="Page_iii.71">iii. 71</a></span>scription Act, suggesting the hope that in the meantime New
York's quota might be filled by volunteers. &quot;It is believed by at
least one-half of the people of the loyal States,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that the
Conscription Act, which they are called upon to obey, is in itself a
violation of the supreme constitutional law.... In the minds of the
American people the duty of obedience and the rights to protection are
inseparable. If it is, therefore, proposed on the one hand to exact
obedience at the point of the bayonet, and, upon the other hand, to
shut off, by military power, all approach to our judicial tribunals,
we have reason to fear the most ruinous results.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>This letter was neither gracious nor candid. While dealing in columns
of figures to prove the inaccuracy of the enrolment, it concealed the
fact that, although urged to co&#246;perate with the enrolling officers, he
had ignored their invitation to verify the enrolment. In menacing
tones, too, he intimated &quot;the consequences of a violent, harsh policy,
before the constitutionality of the Act is tested.&quot; It was evident he
had given much thought to the question, but his prolixity betrayed the
feeling of an official who, conscious of having erred in doing nothing
in anticipation of riot and bloodshed, wished now to make a big
showing of duty performed.</p>

<p>Lincoln's reply not only emphasised the difference between the
political aptitude of himself and Seymour, but marked him as the more
magnanimous and far the greater man. The President raised no issue as
to enrolments, wasted no arguments over columns of figures, and
referred in nowise to the past. He briefly outlined a method of
verification which quickly established,&#8212;what might have been shown in
June had the Governor given the matter attention,&#8212;an excess of 13,000
men enrolled in the Brooklyn and New York districts. Although he would
be glad, said Lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.72" id="Page_iii.72">iii. 72</a></span>coln, to facilitate a decision of the Court and
abide by it,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> he declined longer to delay the draft &quot;because time
is too important.... We are contending with an enemy who, as I
understand, drives every able-bodied man he can reach into his ranks,
very much as a butcher drives bullocks into a slaughter-pen. No time
is wasted, no argument is used. This produces an army which will soon
turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the field, if they
are not sustained by recruits as they should be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>When the drawing was resumed on August 19, 10,000 infantry and three
batteries of artillery, picked troops from the Army of the Potomac,
beside a division of the State National Guard, backed the Governor's
proclamation counselling submission to the execution of the law. In
this presence the draft proceeded peacefully.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the loyal millions of the North, longing for victory in the
field, found their prayers answered. Gettysburg and Vicksburg had
pierced the spirit of the South, Cumberland Gap had liberated East
Tennessee, Fort Smith and Little Rock supplied a firm footing for the
army beyond the Mississippi, and the surrender of Port Hudson
permitted Federal gunboats to pass unvexed to the sea. The rift in the
war cloud had, indeed, let in a flood of sunlight, and, while it
lasted, gave fresh courage and larger faith.</p>

<h2>SEYMOUR REBUKED</h2>

<h2>1863</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg turned the Republican Union
convention, held at Syracuse on September 2, into a meeting of
rejoicing. Weed did not attend, but the Conservatives, led by Henry J.
Raymond and Edwin D. Morgan, boldly talked of its control. Ward Hunt
became temporary chairman. Hunt was a lawyer whom politics did not
attract. Since his unsuccessful effort to become a United States
senator in 1857 he had turned aside from his profession only when
necessary to strengthen the cause of the Union. At such times he shone
as the representative of a wise patriotism. He did not belong in the
class of attractive platform speakers, nor possess the weaknesses of
blind followers of party chieftains. His power rested upon the
strength of his character as a well-poised student of affairs. What he
believed came forcefully from a mind that formed its own judgments,
and whether his words gave discomfort to the little souls that
governed caucuses, or to the great journalists that sought to force
their own policies, he was in no wise disturbed.</p>

<p>Upon taking the chair Hunt began his remarks in the tone of one who
felt more than he desired to express, but as the mention of Gettysburg
and Vicksburg revealed the unbounded enthusiasm of the men before him,
the optimism that characterised the people's belief in the summer of
1863 quickly took possession of him, and he coupled with the
declaration that the rebel armies were nearly destroyed, the opinion
that peace was near at hand. For the moment the party seemed solidly
united. But when the echoes of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.74" id="Page_iii.74">iii. 74</a></span> continued cheering had subsided
the bitterness of faction flashed out with increased intensity. To the
Radicals, Raymond's suggestion of Edwin D. Morgan for permanent
chairman was as gall and wormwood, and his talk of an entire new
ticket most alarming. However, George Opdyke and Horace Greeley, the
Radical leaders, chastened by the defeat of Wadsworth and the election
of Morgan to the Senate, did not now forget the value of discretion.
Hunt's selection as temporary chairman had been a concession, and in
the choice of a permanent presiding officer, although absolutely
unyielding in their hostility to Morgan, they graciously accepted
Abraham Wakeman, an apostle of the conservative school.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Their
attitude toward Morgan, however, cost Opdyke a place on the State
Committee, and for a time threatened to exclude the Radicals from
recognition upon the ticket.</p>

<p>The refusal of men to accept nominations greatly embarrassed
Conservatives in harvesting their victory. Thomas W. Olcott of Albany
was nominated for comptroller in place of Lucius Robinson. Of all the
distinguished men who had filled that office none exhibited a more
inflexible firmness than Robinson in holding the public purse strings.
He was honest by nature and by practice. Neither threats nor ingenious
devices disturbed him, but with a fidelity as remarkable as it was
rare he pushed aside the emissaries of extravagance and corruption as
readily as a plow turns under the sod. After two years of such
methods, however, the representatives of a wide-open treasury noisily
demanded a change. But Olcott, a financier of wide repute, wisely
declined to be used for such a purpose, and Robinson was accepted.</p>

<p>Daniel S. Dickinson, after the inconsequential treatment accorded him
in the recent contest for United States senator, suddenly discovered
that domestic reasons disabled him from serving longer as
attorney-general. Then James T. Brady declined, although tendered the
nomination without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.75" id="Page_iii.75">iii. 75</a></span> dissenting voice. This reduced the convention,
in its search for a conspicuous War Democrat, to the choice of John
Cochrane, the well-known orator who had left the army in the preceding
February. In choosing a Secretary of State the embarrassment
continued. Greeley encouraged the candidacy of Chauncey M. Depew, but
concluded, at the last moment, that Peter A. Porter, the colonel of a
regiment and a son of the gallant general of the war of 1812, must
head the ticket.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Porter, however, refused to exchange a military
for a civil office, and Depew was substituted.</p>

<p>Depew, then a young man of twenty-nine, gave promise of his subsequent
brilliant career. He lived a neighbour to Horace Greeley, whom he
greatly admired, and to whom he tactfully spoke the honeyed words,
always so agreeable to the <i>Tribune's</i> editor.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Perhaps no one in
the State possessed a more pleasing personality. He made other people
as happy as he was himself. To this charm of manner were added a
singularly attractive presence, a pleasing voice, and the oratorical
gifts that won him recognition even before he left Yale College. From
the first he exhibited a marked capacity for public life. He had an
unfailing readiness, a wide knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.76" id="Page_iii.76">iii. 76</a></span>edge of affairs, a keen sense of the
ridiculous, and a flow of clear and easy language which never failed
to give full and precise expression to all that was in his mind. He
rarely provoked enmities, preferring light banter to severe invective
or unsparing ridicule. Among his associates he was the prince of
raconteurs. In conventions few men were heard with keener interest,
and every Republican recognised the fact that a new force had come
into the councils of the party. There never was a time when people
regarded him as &quot;a coming man,&quot; for he took a leading place at once.
In 1861, three years after his admission to the bar, the Peekskill
voters sent him to the Assembly, and the next year his colleagues
selected him for speaker, an honour which he generously relinquished
that his party might elect a United States senator. Now, within the
same year, he found a place at the head of the ticket, which he led
during the campaign with marked ability.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The platform endorsed the Administration, praised the soldiers,
opposed a peace that changed the Constitution except in the form
prescribed by it, deplored the creation of a spirit of partisan
hostility against the Government, and promised that New York would do
its full share in maintaining the Union; but it skilfully avoided
mentioning the conscription act and the emancipation proclamation,
which Seymour charged had changed the war for the Union into a war for
abolition. When a delegate, resenting the omission, moved a resolution
commending emancipation, Raymond reminded him that he was in a Union,
not a Republican convention, and that many loyal men doubted the
propriety of such an endorsement. This position proved too
conservative for the ordinary up-State delegate, and a motion to table
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.77" id="Page_iii.77">iii. 77</a></span> resolution quickly failed. Thereupon Charles A. Folger of Geneva
moved to amend by adding the words, &quot;and as a war measure is
thoroughly legal and justifiable.&quot; Probably no man in the convention,
by reason of his learning and solidity of character, had greater
influence. In 1854 he left the Democratic party with Ward Hunt, whom
he resembled as a lawyer, and whom he was to follow to the Court of
Appeals and like him attain the highest eminence. Just then he was
forty-five years old, a State senator of gentle bearing and stout
heart, who dared to express his positive convictions, and whose
suggested amendment, offered with the firmness of a man conscious of
being in the right, encountered slight opposition.</p>

<p>The President's letter, addressed to the Union convention of New York,
gave the Radicals great comfort. With direct and forceful language
Lincoln took the people into his confidence. There are but three ways,
he said, to stop the war; first, by suppressing rebellion, which he
was trying to do; second, by giving up the Union, which he was trying
to prevent; and third, by some imaginable compromise, which was
impossible if it embraced the maintenance of the Union. The strength
of the rebellion is in its army, which dominates all the country and
all the people within its range. Any offer of terms made by men within
that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the
present, because such men have no power whatever to enforce their side
of a compromise if one were made with them. Suppose refugees from the
South and peace men from the North hold a convention of the States,
how can their action keep Lee out of Pennsylvania? To be effective a
compromise must come from those in control of the rebel army, or from
the people after our army has suppressed that army. As no suggestion
of peace has yet come from that source, all thought of peace for the
present was out of the question. If any proposition shall hereafter
come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you.</p>

<p>To be plain, he continued, you are dissatisfied about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.78" id="Page_iii.78">iii. 78</a></span> negro. You
opposed compensated emancipation and you dislike proclaimed
emancipation. If slaves are property, is there any question that by
the law of war such property, both of enemies and friends, may be
taken when needed? And is it not needed when its taking helps us and
hurts our enemy? But you say the proclamation is unconstitutional. If
it is not valid, it needs no retraction. If it is valid, it cannot be
retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life. You profess
to think its retraction would help the Union. Why better <i>after</i> the
retraction than <i>before</i> the issue? Those in revolt had one hundred
days to consider it, and the war, since its issuance, has progressed
as favourably for us as before. Some of the commanders who have won
our most important victories believe the emancipation policy the
heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebels, and that in one instance, at
least, victory came with the aid of black soldiers. You say you will
not fight to free negroes. Whenever you are urged, after resistance to
the Union is conquered, to continue to fight, it will be time enough
to refuse. Do you not think, in the struggle for the Union, that the
withdrawal of negro help from the enemy weakens his resistance to you?
That what negroes can do as soldiers leaves so much less for white
soldiers to do? But why should negroes do anything for us, if we will
do nothing for them? and if they, on the promise of freedom, stake
their lives to save the Union, shall the promise not be kept?</p>

<p>The signs look better, he concluded. Peace does not appear so distant
as it did. When it comes, it will prove that no appeal lies from the
ballot to the bullet, and that those who take it are sure to lose
their case and pay the costs. &quot;And then there will be some black men
who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and
steady eye, and well poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to
this great consummation; while I fear there will be some white ones
unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they
have striven to hinder it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.79" id="Page_iii.79">iii. 79</a></span></p>
<p>The influence of this letter, increased by the dignity and power of
the President's office, proved a sharp thorn to the Democrats. Recent
military successes had made it appear for the time, at least, that
rebellion was about to collapse, and the Democratic State Union
convention, which convened at Albany on September 9, shifted its
policy from a protest against war measures to an appeal for
conciliation. In other words, it was against subjugation, which would
not leave &quot;the Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is.&quot; In its
effort to emphasise this plea it refused to recognise or affiliate
with the Constitutional Union party, controlled by James Brooks and
other extreme peace advocates,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and although its platform still
condemned emancipation, conscription, and arbitrary arrests, the
pivotal declaration, based on &quot;manifestations of a returning
allegiance on the part of North Carolina and other seceded States,&quot;
favoured a wise statesmanship &quot;which shall encourage the Union
sentiment of the South and unite more thoroughly the people of the
North.&quot; Amasa J. Parker, chairman of the convention, who still talked
of a &quot;yawning gulf of ruin,&quot; admitted that such a policy brought a
gleam of hope to the country, and Governor Seymour, at the end of a
dreary speech explanatory of his part in the draft-riot,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.80" id="Page_iii.80">iii. 80</a></span> a willingness to &quot;bury violations of law and the rights of
States and individuals if such a magnanimous course shall be
pursued.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Lincoln's letter, however, unexpectedly spoiled such an
appeal, compelling the convention to &quot;regret&quot; that the President
contemplates no measure for the restoration of the Union, &quot;but looking
to an indefinite protraction of the war for abolition purposes points
to no future save national bankruptcy and the subversion of our
institutions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans, backed by success in the field, started with an
advantage which the cheering news from Maine strengthened. It soon
become manifest, too, that the Gibraltar of Democracy resented the
destructive work of mobs and rioters. Criticism of Seymour also became
drastic. &quot;He hobnobbed with the copperhead party in Connecticut,&quot; said
the <i>Herald</i>, &quot;and lost that election; he endorsed Vallandigham, and
did nothing during the riot but talk. He has let every opportunity
pass and rejected all offers that would prove him the man for the
place. The sooner he is dropped as incompetent, the better it will be
for the ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The <i>Tribune</i> imputed nepotism. &quot;His brother,&quot;
it said, &quot;gets $200 per month as agent, a nephew $150 as an officer,
and two nephews and a cousin $1,000 a year each as clerks in the
executive departments.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> But Martin I. Townsend, at a great mass
meeting in New York City, presented the crushing indictment against
him. Although the clock had tolled the midnight hour, the large
audience remained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.81" id="Page_iii.81">iii. 81</a></span> hear Townsend for the same reason, suggested
Edwin D. Morgan, the chairman, that the disciples sat up all night
whenever the great apostle was with them. Townsend was then
fifty-three years old. For more than a decade his rare ability as a
speaker had kept him a favorite, and for a quarter of a century longer
he was destined to delight the people. On this occasion, however, his
arraignment left a deeper and more lasting impression than his words
ordinarily did. &quot;Seymour,&quot; he said, &quot;undertook to increase enlistments
by refusing the soldier his political franchise. On the supposition
that Meade would be defeated, he delivered a Fourth of July address
that indicted the free people of the North and placed him in the front
rank of men whom rebels delight to honour. If there was a traitor in
New York City on that day he was in the company of Horatio Seymour.
Finally, he pronounced as 'friends' the men, who, stirred to action by
his incendiary words, applied the torch and the bludgeon in the draft
riot of July 13, 14, and 15.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>In the four speeches delivered in the campaign, Seymour was never
cleverer or more defiant.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> He exhibited great skill in criticising
the Administration, charging that disasters had brought bankruptcy,
that ill-advised acts of subordinates had sapped the liberties of the
people, and that base motives inspired the policy of the Government.
He denounced the Radicals as craven Americans, devoid of patriotic
feeling, who were trying to make the humiliation and degradation of
their country a stepping-stone to continued power. &quot;They say we must
fight until slavery is extinguished. We are to upturn the foundations
of our Constitution. At this very moment, when the fate of the nation
and of individuals trembles in the balance, these madmen ask us to
plunge into a bottomless pit of controversy upon indefinite purposes.
Does not every man know that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.82" id="Page_iii.82">iii. 82</a></span> must have a united North to triumph?
Can we get a united North upon a theory that the Constitution can be
set aside at the will of one man, because, forsooth, he judges it to
be a military necessity? I never yet heard that Abraham Lincoln was a
military necessity.... The Vice-President says, 'There are men in your
midst who want the Union as it was and the Constitution as it is,' and
he adds, sneeringly, 'They can't have it.' We will tell him there are
many such men, and we say to him we will have it. There has never been
a sentiment in the North or South put forth more treasonable,
cowardly, and base than this.&quot; Referring to the President's call, on
October 17, for 300,000 volunteers, to be followed by a draft if not
promptly filled, he exclaimed: &quot;Again, 600,000 men are called
for&#8212;600,000 homes to be entered. The young man will be compelled to
give up the cornerstone of his fortune, which he has laid away with
toil and care, to begin the race of life. The old man will pay that
which he has saved, as the support of his declining years, to rescue
his son. In God's name, let these operations be fair if they must be
cruel.&quot; In conclusion he professed undying loyalty. &quot;We love that flag
[pointing to the Stars and Stripes] with the whole love of our life,
and every star that glitters on its blue field is sacred. And we will
preserve the Constitution, we will preserve the Union, we will
preserve our flag with every star upon it, and we will see to it that
there is a State for every star.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>In their extremity Dean Richmond and Peter Cagger, taking advantage of
the President's call for more troops, issued a circular on the eve of
election, alleging that the State would receive no credit for drafted
men commuted; that towns which had furnished their quotas would be
subject to a new conscription; and that men having commuted were
liable to be immediately drafted again.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> This was the prototype of
Burchard's &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.83" id="Page_iii.83">iii. 83</a></span> in 1884, and might have
become no less disastrous had not the Provost-marshal General quickly
contradicted it. As a parting shot, Seward, speaking at Auburn on the
night before election, declared that if the ballot box could be passed
through the camps of the Confederate soldiers, every man would vote
for the administration of our government by Horatio Seymour and
against the administration of Abraham Lincoln.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The October elections foreshadowed the result in November. Although
the Democrats had derived great advantage in 1862 because of their
bold stand for civil liberty and freedom of speech, a year later such
arguments proved of little avail. Gettysburg and Vicksburg had turned
the tide, and Seymour and the draft riot carried it to the flood.
Depew's majority, mounting higher and higher as the returns came
slowly from the interior, turned the Governor's surprise into shame.
In his career of a quarter of a century Seymour had learned to accept
disappointment as well as success, but his failure in 1863 to forecast
the trend of changing public sentiment cost him the opportunity of
ever again leading his party to victory.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<h2>STRIFE OF RADICAL AND CONSERVATIVE</h2>

<h2>1864</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">In</span> his Auburn speech Seward had declared for Lincoln's
renomination.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Proof of the intimate personal relations existing
between the President and his Secretary came into national notice in
1862 when a committee of nine Radical senators, charging to Seward's
conservatism the failure of a vigorous and successful prosecution of
the war, formally demanded his dismissal from the Cabinet. On learning
of their action the Secretary had immediately resigned. &quot;Do you still
think Seward ought to be excused?&quot; asked Lincoln at the end of a long
and stormy interview. Four answered &quot;Yes,&quot; three declined to vote, and
Harris of New York said &quot;No.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The result of this conference led
Secretary Chase, the chief of the Radicals, to tender his resignation
also. But the President, &quot;after most anxious consideration,&quot; requested
each to resume the duties of his department. Speaking of the matter
afterward to Senator Harris, Lincoln declared with his usual
mirth-provoking illustration: &quot;If I had yielded to that storm and
dismissed Seward, the thing would all have slumped one way. Now I can
ride; I have got a pumpkin in each end of my bag.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Other causes than loyalty contributed to the President's regard for
Seward. In their daily companionship the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.85" id="Page_iii.85">iii. 85</a></span> took a genial,
philosophical view of the national struggle, not shared by all his
Cabinet associates, while Lincoln dissipated the gloom with quaint
illustrations of Western life.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> At one of these familiar fireside
talks the President expressed the hope that Seward might be his
successor, adding that the friends so grievously disappointed at
Chicago would thus find all made right at last. To this Seward, in his
clear-headed and kind-hearted way, replied: &quot;No, that is all past and
ended. The logic of events requires you to be your own successor. You
were elected in 1860, but the Southern States refused to submit. They
thought the decision made at the polls could be reversed in the field.
They are still in arms, and their hope now is that you and your party
will be voted down at the next election. When that election is held
and they find the people reaffirming their decision to have you
President, I think the rebellion will collapse.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Unlike Seward, Thurlow Weed wabbled in his loyalty to the President.
Chafing under the retention of Hiram C. Barney as collector of
customs, Weed thought Lincoln too tolerant of Radicals whose
opposition was ill concealed. &quot;They will all be against him in '64,&quot;
he wrote David Davis, then an associate justice of the United States
Supreme Court. &quot;Why does he persist in giving them weapons with which
they may defeat his renomination?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Barney had become a burden to
Lincoln, who really desired to be rid of him. Many complaints of
irregularity disclosed corrupt practices which warranted a change for
the public good. Besides, said the President, &quot;the establishment was
being run almost exclusively in the interest of the Radicals. I felt
great delicacy in doing anything that might be offensive to my friend.
And yet something had to be done. I told Seward he must find him a
diplomatic position. Just then Chase became aware of my little
conspiracy. He was very angry and told me the day Barney left the
custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.86" id="Page_iii.86">iii. 86</a></span> house, with or without his own consent, he would withdraw from
the Treasury. So I backed down.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's tolerance did not please Weed, whose infrequent calls at the
White House had not escaped notice. &quot;I have been brought to fear
recently,&quot; the President wrote with characteristic tenderness, &quot;that
somehow, by commission or omission, I have caused you some degree of
pain. I have never entertained an unkind feeling or a disparaging
thought towards you; and if I have said or done anything which has
been construed into such unkindness or disparagement it has been
misconstrued. I am sure if we could meet we would not part with any
unpleasant impression on either side.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Such a letter from such a
man stirred the heart of the iron-willed boss, who hastened to
Washington. He had much to say. Among other things he unfolded a plan
for peace. It proposed full amnesty to all persons engaged in the war
and an armistice for ninety days, during which time such citizens of
the Confederate States as embrace the offered pardon &quot;shall, as a
State or States, or as citizens thereof, be restored in all respects
to the rights, privileges, and prerogatives which they enjoyed before
their secession from the Union.&quot; If, however, such offer is rejected,
the authority of the United States denied, and the war against the
Union continued, the President should partition all territory, whether
farms, villages, or cities, among the officers and soldiers conquering
the same.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>In presenting this plan Weed argued that if the offer was rejected it
would secure &quot;a united North in favour of war to the knife.&quot; Besides,
the armistice, occurring when the season interrupts active army
movements, would cause little delay and give ample time for widespread
circulation of the proclamation. Respecting the division of lands
among soldiers, he said it would stop desertion, avoid the payment of
bounties, and quickly fill the army with enterprising yeomen who would
want homes after the termination of hostili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.87" id="Page_iii.87">iii. 87</a></span>ties. It had long been
practised in maritime wars by all civilized nations, he said, and
being a part of international law it could not in reason be objected
to, especially as the sufferers would have rejected most liberal
offers of peace and prosperity. Weed frankly admitted that Seward did
not like the scheme, and that Senator Wilson of Massachusetts eyed it
askance; but Stanton approved it, he said, and Dean Richmond
authorised him to say that if fairly carried out the North would be a
unit in support of the war and the rebellion would be crushed within
six months after the expiration of the armistice.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>In conversation Weed was the most persuasive of men. To a quiet,
gentle, deferential manner, he added a giant's grasp of the subject,
presenting its strong points and marshalling with extraordinary skill
all the details. Nevertheless, the proposition now laid before the
President, leaving slavery as it was, could not be accepted. &quot;The
emancipation proclamation could not be retracted,&quot; he had said in his
famous letter to the New York convention, &quot;any more than the dead
could be brought to life.&quot; However, Lincoln did not let the famous
editor depart empty-handed. Barney should be removed, and Weed,
satisfied with such a scalp, returned home to enter the campaign for
the President's renomination.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Something seemed to be wrong in New York. Other States through
conventions and legislatures had early favored the President's
renomination, while the Empire State moved slowly. Party machinery
worked well. The Union Central Committee, holding a special meeting on
January 4, 1864 at the residence of Edwin D. Morgan, recommended
Lincoln's nomination. &quot;It is going to be difficult to restrain the
boys,&quot; said Morgan in a letter to the President, &quot;and there is not
much use in trying to do so.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> On February 23 the Republican State
Committee also endorsed him, and several Union League clubs spoke
earnestly of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.88" id="Page_iii.88">iii. 88</a></span> &quot;prudence, sagacity, comprehension, and
perseverance.&quot; But the absence of an early State convention, the tardy
selection of delegates to Baltimore, and the failure of the
Legislature to act, did not reveal the enthusiasm evinced in other
Commonwealths. Following the rule adopted elsewhere, resolutions
favourable to the President's renomination were duly presented to the
Assembly, where they remained unacted upon. Suddenly on January 25 a
circular, signed by Simeon Draper and issued by the Conference
Committee of the Union Lincoln Association of New York, proposed that
all citizens of every town and county who favoured Lincoln's
nomination meet in some appropriate place on February 22 and make
public expression to that fact. Among the twenty-five names attached
appeared those of Moses Taylor and Moses H. Grinnell. This was a new
system of tactics. But the legislative resolutions did not advance
because of it.</p>

<p>A month later a letter addressed by several New Yorkers to the
National Republican Executive Committee requested the postponement of
the Baltimore convention.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> &quot;The country is not now in a position
to enter into a presidential contest,&quot; it said. &quot;All parties friendly
to the Government should be united in support of a single candidate.
Such unanimity cannot at present be obtained. Upon the result of
measures adopted to finish the war during the present spring and
summer will depend the wish of the people to continue their present
leaders, or to exchange them for others. Besides, whatever will tend
to lessen the duration of an acrimonious Presidential campaign will be
an advantage to the country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> If the sentiment of this letter was
not new, the number and character of its signers produced a profound
sensation. William Cullen Bryant headed the list, and of the
twenty-three names, seventeen were leading State senators, among them
Charles J. Folger and James M. Cook. &quot;This list,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>,
&quot;contains the names of two-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.89" id="Page_iii.89">iii. 89</a></span>thirds of the Unionists chosen to our
present State Senate, the absence of others preventing their signing.
We understand that but two senators declined to affix their
name.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Greeley did not sign this letter, but in an earlier
communication to the <i>Independent</i> he had urged a postponement of the
convention.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Moreover, he had indicated in the <i>Tribune</i> that
Chase, Fremont, Butler, or Grant would make as good a President as
Lincoln, while the nomination of either would preserve &quot;the salutary
one-term principle.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>It is not easy to determine the cause or the full extent of the
dissatisfaction with Lincoln among New York Republicans. Seward's
influence and Weed's relations seriously weakened him. After the
election of 1862 Radicals openly charged them with Wadsworth's defeat.
For the same reason the feeling against Edwin D. Morgan had become
intensely bitter. Seeing a newspaper paragraph that these men had been
in consultation with the President about his message, Senator Chandler
of Michigan, the prince of Radicals, wrote a vehement letter to
Lincoln, telling him of a &quot;patriotic organisation in all the free and
border States, containing to-day over one million of voters, every man
of whom is your friend upon radical measures of your administration;
but there is not a Seward or a Weed man among them all. These men are
a millstone about your neck. You drop them and they are politically
ended forever.... Conservatives and traitors are buried together. For
God's sake don't exhume their remains in your message. They will smell
worse than Lazarus did after he had been buried three days.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Although Weed had left the President with the promise of aiding him,
he could accomplish nothing. The Legislature refused to act, demands
for the postponement of the national convention continued to appear,
and men every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.90" id="Page_iii.90">iii. 90</a></span>where resented conservative leadership. This was
especially true of Greeley and the <i>Tribune</i>, Bryant and the <i>Evening
Post</i>, and Beecher and the <i>Independent</i>, not to mention other
Radicals and radical papers throughout the State, whose opposition
represented a formidable combination. Except for this discontent the
Cleveland convention would scarcely have been summoned into existence.
Of the three calls issued for its assembling two had their birth in
New York, one headed by George B. Cheever, the eminent divine, who had
recently toured England in behalf of the Union,&#8212;the other by Lucius
Robinson, State comptroller, and John Cochrane, attorney-general.
Cheever's call denounced &quot;the imbecile and vacillating policy of the
present Administration in the conduct of the war,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> while Robinson
and Cochrane emphasised the need of a President who &quot;can suppress
rebellion without infringing the rights of individual or State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>That Weed no longer possessed the wand of a Warwick was clearly
demonstrated at the Republican State convention, held at Syracuse on
May 26, to select delegates to Baltimore. Each faction, led in person
by Greeley and Weed, professed to favour the President's renomination,
but the fierce and bitter contest over the admission of delegates from
New York City widened the breach. The Weed machine, following the
custom of previous years, selected an equal number of delegates from
each ward. The Radicals, who denounced this system as an arbitrary
expression of bossism, chose a delegation representing each ward in
proportion to the number of its Republican voters. The delegation
accepted would control the convention, and although the Radicals
consented to the admission of both on equal terms, the Weed forces,
confident of their strength, refused the compromise. This set the
Radicals to work, and at the morning session, amidst the wildest
confusion and disorder, they elected Lyman Tremaine temporary chairman
by a majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.91" id="Page_iii.91">iii. 91</a></span> of six over Chauncey M. Depew, the young secretary of
state, whose popularity had given the Conservatives an abnormal
strength.</p>

<p>In his speech the Chairman commented upon the death of James S.
Wadsworth, killed in the battle of the Wilderness on May 6, from whose
obsequies, held at Geneseo on the 21st, many delegates had just
returned. Tremaine believed that the soldier's blood would &quot;lie heavy
on the souls of those pretended supporters of the government in its
hour of trial, whose cowardice and treachery contributed to his defeat
for governor.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> In such a spirit he eulogised Wadsworth's
character and patriotism, declaring that if justice had been done him
by the Conservatives, he would now, instead of sleeping in his grave,
be governor of New York. Although spoken gently and with emotions of
sadness, these intolerably aggressive sentences, loudly applauded by
the Radicals, stirred the Weed delegates into whispered threats.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
But Tremaine did not rely upon words alone. He packed the committee on
contested seats, whose report, admitting both city delegations on
equal terms, was accepted by the enormous majority of 192 to 98,
revealing the fact that the great body of up-State Republicans
distrusted Thurlow Weed, whose proposition for peace did not include
the abolition of slavery. Other reasons, however, accounted for the
large majority. Tremaine, no longer trusting to the leadership of
Greeley,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> marshalled the Radical forces with a skill learned in
the school of Seymour and Dean Richmond, and when his drilled cohorts
went into action the tumultuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.92" id="Page_iii.92">iii. 92</a></span> and belligerent character of the
scene resembled the uproar familiar to one who had trained with
Tammany and fought with Mozart Hall. In concluding its work the
convention endorsed the President and selected sixty-six delegates,
headed by Raymond, Dickinson, Tremaine, and Preston King as
delegates-at-large.</p>

<p>The echo of the Syracuse contest reached the Cleveland convention,
which assembled on May 31. Of all the distinguished New Yorkers whose
names had advertised and given character to this movement John
Cochrane alone attended. Indeed, the picturesque speech of Cochrane,
as chairman, and the vehement letter of Lucius Robinson, advocating
the nomination of Grant, constituted the only attractive feature of
the proceedings. Cochrane and Robinson wanted a party in which they
could feel at home. To Cochrane the Republican party was &quot;a medley of
trading, scurvy politicians, which never represented War
Democrats,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> while Robinson thought the country &quot;had survived,
through three years of war, many bad mistakes of a weak Executive and
Cabinet, simply because the popular mind had been intensely fixed upon
the single purpose of suppressing rebellion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Both resented the
Administration's infringement of individual rights. &quot;Whoever attacks
them,&quot; said Cochrane, &quot;wounds the vital parts of the Republic. Not
even the plea of necessity allows any one to trample upon them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
The Cleveland convention, however, did not help these statesmen any
more than the nomination of John C. Fremont and John Cochrane, &quot;the
two Johns from New York&quot; as they were called, injured the
President.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> When Lincoln heard that instead of the many thousands
expected only three or four hundred attended, he opened his Bible and
read: &quot;And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.93" id="Page_iii.93">iii. 93</a></span>
debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto
him; and he became a captain over them; and there were with him about
four hundred.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Lucius Robinson's suggestion that Grant be nominated for President
represented the thought of many New Yorkers prominent in political
circles. &quot;All eyes and hopes now centre on Grant,&quot; wrote Thurlow Weed
on April 17. &quot;If he wins in Virginia it will brighten the horizon and
make him President.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The <i>Herald</i> sounded the praises of the
Lieutenant-General in nearly every issue. The <i>Tribune</i> and <i>Times</i>
were equally flattering. Even the <i>World</i> admitted that a skilful
general handled the army.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Other papers throughout the State
expressed similar confidence in his victorious leadership, and with
the hope of changing the sentiment from Lincoln to Grant a great mass
meeting, called ostensibly to express the country's gratitude to the
latter, was held in New York City two days before the meeting of the
National Republican convention. Neither at this time, however, nor at
any other did the movement receive the slightest encouragement from
the hero of Vicksburg, or shake the loyalty of the delegates who
assembled at Baltimore on June 7.</p>

<p>Henry J. Raymond, evidencing the same wise spirit of compromise
exhibited at Syracuse in 1863, reported the platform. It declared the
maintenance of the Union and the suppression of rebellion by force of
arms to be the highest duty of every citizen; it approved the
determination of the government to enter into no compromise with
rebels; favoured the abolition of slavery by constitutional amendment;
applauded the wisdom, patriotism, and fidelity of the President;
thanked the soldiers, and claimed the full protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.94" id="Page_iii.94">iii. 94</a></span> of the laws of
war for coloured troops; encouraged immigration and the early
construction of a railroad to the Pacific coast; pledged the national
faith to keep inviolate the redemption of the public debt; and opposed
the establishment, by foreign military forces, of monarchical
governments in the near vicinity of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> On the
second day every State voted for Lincoln for President.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>The contest for Vice-President renewed the fight of the New York
factions. An impression had early taken root in the country that a War
Democrat should be selected, and the Radicals of New York, under the
leadership of Lyman Tremaine, quickly designated Daniel S. Dickinson
as the man. Dickinson's acceptability in New England and New Jersey
strengthened his candidacy, while its approval by three or four border
and western States seriously weakened Hamlin. Nevertheless, the New
York Conservatives vigorously opposed him. Their antagonism did not at
first concentrate upon any one candidate. Weed talked of Hamlin and
later of Joseph Holt of Kentucky; Raymond thought Andrew Johnson of
Tennessee the stronger; and Preston King, to the great surprise of the
Radicals, agreed with him. This brought from George William Curtis the
sarcastic remark that a Vice-President from the Empire State would
prevent its having a Cabinet officer. Tremaine declared that a change
in the Cabinet would not be a serious calamity to the country, and
Preston King, who attributed his displacement from the United States
Senate to the Seward influence, did not object to the Secretary's
removal. Thus Raymond's influence gave the doughty War Governor 32 of
New York's 66 votes to 28 for Dickinson and 6 for Hamlin. This
materially aided Johnson's nomination on the first ballot.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.95" id="Page_iii.95">iii. 95</a></span></p>
<p>Raymond's power and influence may be said to have climaxed in 1864 at
the Baltimore convention. He became chairman of the New York
delegation, chairman of the committee on resolutions, chairman of the
National Executive Committee, and the principal debater upon the
floor, manifesting a tact in the performance of his manifold duties
that surprised as much as it charmed. But the reason for his ardent
support of Johnson will probably never be certainly known. McClure
declared that he acted in accord with the wishes of Lincoln, who
discreetly favoured and earnestly desired Johnson's nomination. This
view was approved by George Jones, the proprietor of the <i>Times</i> and
Raymond's most intimate friend.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> On the other hand, Nicolay
declared that &quot;it was with minds absolutely untrammelled by even any
knowledge of the President's wishes that the convention went about its
work of selecting his associate on the ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> In his long and
bitter controversy with Nicolay, however, McClure furnished testimony
indicating that Lincoln whispered his choice and that Raymond
understood it.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>While Raymond antagonised the radical supporters of Dickinson,
patronage questions were again threatening trouble for the President.
Serious friction had followed the appointment of a General Appraiser
at New York, and when John J. Cisco, the assistant United States
treasurer, tendered his resignation to take effect June 30 (1864), the
President desired to appoint one unobjectionable to Senator Morgan;
but Secretary Chase, regardless of the preferences of others, insisted
upon Maunsell B. Field, then an assistant secretary of the treasury.
Morgan vigorously protested, regarding him incompetent to fill such a
place. Besides, the designation of Field, who had no political backing
in New York, would, he said, offend the conservative wing of the
party, which had been entirely ignored in the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.96" id="Page_iii.96">iii. 96</a></span> As a compromise
the Senator begged the President to select Richard M. Blatchford,
Dudley S. Gregory, or Thomas Hillhouse, whom he regarded as three of
the most eminent citizens of New York.</p>

<p>Lincoln, in a note to the Secretary, submitted these names. &quot;It will
really oblige me,&quot; he wrote, &quot;if you will make choice among these
three, or any other men that Senators Morgan and Harris will be
satisfied with.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> This brief letter was followed on the same day
by one presenting the annoyance to which patronage subjects a
President. Happily civil service reform has removed much of this evil,
but enough remains to keep an Executive, if not members of Congress,
in hot water. &quot;As the proverb goes,&quot; wrote Lincoln, &quot;no man knows so
well where the shoe pinches as he who wears it. I do not think Mr.
Field a very proper man for the place, but I would trust your judgment
and forego this were the greater difficulty out of the way. Much as I
personally like Mr. Barney it has been a great burden to me to retain
him in his place when nearly all our friends in New York were directly
or indirectly urging his removal. Then the appointment of Judge
Hogeboom to be general appraiser brought me to the verge of open
revolt. Now the appointment of Mr. Field would precipitate me in it,
unless Senator Morgan and those feeling as he does could be brought to
concur in it. Strained as I already am at this point, I do not think I
can make this appointment in the direction of still greater
strain.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Chase had relieved the tension temporarily by inducing Cisco to
withdraw his resignation, but after getting the President's second
letter, cleverly intimating that Field's appointment might necessitate
the removal of Barney, the Secretary promptly tendered his
resignation. If the President was surprised, the Secretary, after
reading Lincoln's reply, was not less so. &quot;Your resignation of the
office of secretary of the treasury, sent me yesterday, is accepted,&quot;
said the brief note. &quot;Of all I have said in commendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.97" id="Page_iii.97">iii. 97</a></span> of your
ability and fidelity I have nothing to unsay, and yet you and I have
reached a point of mutual embarrassment in our official relation which
it seems cannot be overcome or longer sustained consistently with the
public service.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Secretary Blaine's hasty resignation in 1892,
and President Harrison's quick acceptance of it, were not more
dramatic, except that Blaine's was tendered on the eve of a national
nominating convention. It is more than doubtful if Chase intended to
resign. He meant it to be as in previous years the beginning of a
correspondence, expecting to receive from the President a soothing
letter with concessions. But Lincoln's stock of patience, if not of
sedatives, was exhausted.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, after William Pitt Fessenden's appointment to
succeed Chase, Simeon Draper became collector of customs. He was one
of Weed's oldest friends and in 1858 had been his first choice for
governor.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> But just now Abraham Wakeman was his first choice for
collector. Possibly in selecting Draper instead of Wakeman, Lincoln
remembered Weed's failure to secure a legislative endorsement of his
renomination, a work specially assigned to him. At all events the
anti-Weed faction accepted Draper as a decided triumph.</p>

<p><br />&quot;<span class="smcap">I shall</span> not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation
Proclamation,&quot; said the President at the opening of Congress in
December, 1863; &quot;nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free
by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.&quot;
But in submitting a plan for the restoration of the Confederate States
he offered amnesty, with rights of property except as to slaves, to
all persons<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> who agreed to obey the Constitution, the laws, and
the Executive proclamations, and proposed that whenever such persons
numbered one-tenth of the qualified voters of a State they &quot;shall be
recognized as the true government of such State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> A week later
the Thirteenth Amendment, forever abolishing slavery, was introduced
into Congress. Thus the purpose of the radical Republicans became
plain.</p>

<p>In January, 1864, Governor Seymour, then the acknowledged head of his
party, made his message to the Legislature a manifesto to the
Democrats of the country. With measured rhetoric he traced the
usurpations of the President and the acknowledged policy that was in
future to guide the Administration. He courageously admitted that a
majority of the people and both branches of Congress sustained the
policy of the President, but such a policy, he declared, subordinating
the laws, the courts, and the people themselves to military power,
destroyed the rights of States and abrogated cherished principles of
government. The past, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.99" id="Page_iii.99">iii. 99</a></span>ever, with its enormous debt, its
depreciated currency, its suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
and its abolition of free speech and a free press, did not mean such
irretrievable ruin as the national bankruptcy which now threatened to
overwhelm the nation. &quot;The problem with which we have to grapple is,&quot;
he said, &quot;how can we bring this war to a conclusion before such
disasters overwhelm us.&quot; Two antagonistic theories, he continued, are
now before us&#8212;one, consecrating the energies of war and the policy of
government to the restoration of the Union as it was and the
Constitution as it is; the other, preventing by the creation of a new
political system the return of the revolted States, though willing to
lay down their arms. This alternative will enable an administration to
perpetuate its power. It is a doctrine of national bankruptcy and
national ruin; it is a measure for continued military despotism over
one-third of our country, which will be the basis for military
despotism over the whole land.</p>

<p>Every measure to convert the war against armed rebellion into one
against private property and personal rights at the South, he
continued, has been accompanied by claims to exercise military power
in the North. The proclamation of emancipation at the South, and the
suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> at the North; the
confiscation of private property in the seceding States, and the
arbitrary arrests, imprisonment, and banishment of the citizens of
loyal States; the claim to destroy political organization at the
South, and the armed interference by Government in local elections at
the North, have been contemporaneous events. We now find that as the
strength of rebellion is broken, new claims to arbitrary power are put
forth. More prerogatives are asserted in the hour of triumph than were
claimed in days of disaster. The war is not to be brought to an end by
the submission of States to the Constitution and their return to the
Union, but to be prolonged until the South is subjugated and accepts
such terms as may be dictated. This theory designs a sweeping
revolution and the creation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.100" id="Page_iii.100">iii. 100</a></span> new political system. There is but
one course, he concluded, which will now save us from such national
ruin&#8212;we must use every influence of wise statesmanship to bring back
the States which now reject their constitutional obligations. The
triumphs won by the soldiers in the field should be followed up by the
peacemaking policy of the statesmen in the Cabinet. In no other way
can we save our Union.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Seymour's claims and portents were in amazing contrast to his proposed
measures of safety. Nevertheless he did his work well. It was his
intention clearly to develop the ultimate tendencies of the war, and,
in a paper of great power and interest, without invective or acerbity,
he did not hesitate to alarm the people respecting the jeopardy of
their own liberties. Indeed, his message had the twofold purpose of
drawing the line distinctly between Administration and
anti-Administration forces, and of concentrating public attention upon
himself as a suitable candidate for President.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Seymour was never
without ambition, for he loved politics and public affairs, and the
Presidency captivated him. With deepest interest he watched the play
at Charleston and at Baltimore in 1860, and had the nomination come to
him, Lincoln's election, depending as it did upon New York, must have
given Republicans increased solicitude. Developments during the war
had stimulated this ambition. The cost of blood and treasure, blended
with arbitrary measures deemed necessary by the Government, pained and
finally exasperated him until he longed to possess the power of an
Executive to make peace. He believed that a compromise, presented in a
spirit of patriotic clemency, with slavery undisturbed, would quickly
terminate hostilities, and although he made the mistake of surrounding
himself with men whose influence sometimes betrayed him into weak and
extreme positions, his ability to present his views in a scholarly and
patriotic manner, backed by a graceful and gracious bearing, kept him
in close touch with a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.101" id="Page_iii.101">iii. 101</a></span> that resented methods which made peace
dependent upon the abolition of slavery. He never provoked the
criticism of those whom he led, nor indulged in levity and flippancy.
But he was unsparing in his lectures to the Administration,
admonishing it to adopt the principles of government which prevailed
when happiness and peace characterised the country's condition, and
prophesying the ruin of the Union unless it took his advice. While,
therefore, his eulogy of the flag, the soldiers, the Union, and the
sacrifices of the people won him reputation for patriotic
conservatism, his condemnation of the Government brought him credit
for supporting and promoting all manner of disturbing factions and
revolutionary movements.</p>

<p>The Regency understood the Governor's ambition, and the Democratic
State convention, assembling at Albany on February 24 to designate
delegates to Chicago, opened the way for him as widely as possible. It
promulgated no issues; it mentioned no candidate; it refused to accept
Fernando Wood and his brother as delegates because of their pronounced
advocacy of a dishonourable peace; and it placed Seymour at the head
of a strong delegation, backed by Dean Richmond and August Belmont,
and controlled by the unit rule. It was a remarkable coincidence, too,
that the New York <i>Herald</i>, which had pursued the Governor for more
than a year with bitter criticism, suddenly lapsed into silence.
Indeed, the only shadow falling upon his pathway in the Empire State
reflected the temporary anger of Tammany, which seceded from the
convention because the McKeon delegation, an insignificant coterie of
advocates of peace-on-any-conditions, had been admitted on terms of
equality.</p>

<p>As the summer advanced political conditions seemed to favour Seymour.
During the gloomy days of July and August the people prayed for a
cessation of hostilities. &quot;The mercantile classes are longing for
peace,&quot; wrote James Russell Lowell,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and Horace Greeley, in a
letter of perfervid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.102" id="Page_iii.102">iii. 102</a></span> vehemence, pictured to the President the unhappy
condition. &quot;Our bleeding, bankrupt, almost dying country,&quot; he said,
&quot;longs for peace, shudders at the prospect of fresh conscriptions, or
further wholesale devastations, and of new rivers of human
blood.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The President, also yearning for peace and willing to
accept almost any proposition if it included the abolition of slavery,
waited for a communication from some agent of the Confederacy
authorised to treat with him; but such an one had not appeared,
although several persons, safely sheltered in Canada, claimed
authority. One of these, calling himself William C. Jewett of
Colorado, finally convinced Horace Greeley that Clement C. Clay of
Alabama and Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, two ambassadors of
Jefferson Davis, were ready at Niagara Falls to meet the President
whenever protection was afforded them. Upon being informed by Greeley
of their presence, Lincoln replied (July 9): &quot;If you can find any
person, anywhere, professing to have any proposition of Jefferson
Davis in writing for peace, embracing the restoration of the Union and
abandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him he may
come to me with you.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>While Greeley, hesitating to undertake the mission himself, indulged
in further correspondence with the President, James P. Jaquess, a
Methodist clergyman and colonel of an Illinois regiment, with the
knowledge of Lincoln, but without official authority except to pass
the Union lines, obtained (July 17) an audience with Jefferson Davis,
to whom he made overtures of peace. In the interview Davis declared
that &quot;we are not fighting for slavery. We are fighting for
independence, and that or extermination we will have. We will be free.
We will govern ourselves. We will do it if we have to see every
Southern plantation sacked and every Southern city in flames.... Say
to Mr. Lincoln from me that I shall at any time be pleased to receive
proposals for peace on the basis of our independence. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.103" id="Page_iii.103">iii. 103</a></span> will be
useless to approach me with any other.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> It is known now that
Jaquess' report was substantially correct, but at the time the peace
advocate defiantly challenged its truth and the conservative was
incredulous.</p>

<p>Meantime Greeley (July 16) proceeded to Niagara Falls. Thompson was
not there and Clay had no authority to act. When the famous editor
asked fresh instructions Lincoln sent John Hay, his private secretary,
with the historic paper of July 18, which stopped further
negotiations.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> In this well-meant effort the President desired to
convince his own party of the hopelessness of any satisfactory peace
until the surrender of Lee's and Johnston's armies; but to the people,
grieved by the death of loved ones, or oppressed by constant anxiety,
his brief ultimatum seemed maladroit, while the men who favoured peace
simply on condition of the restoration of the Union, without the
abolition of slavery, resented his course as arbitrary and needlessly
cruel.</p>

<p>Lincoln's unpopularity touched bottom at this moment. The
dissatisfaction found expression in a secret call for a second
national convention, to be held at Cincinnati on September 28, to
nominate, if necessary, a new candidate for President.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> This
movement, vigorously promoted in Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.104" id="Page_iii.104">iii. 104</a></span> by Salmon P. Chase, received
cordial support in New York City. George Opdyke directed it, Horace
Greeley heartily endorsed it, Daniel S. Dickinson favoured it, and
Lucius Robinson and David Dudley Field sympathised with it.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Parke
Godwin and William Curtis Noyes, if unwilling to go as far as Opdyke
and Greeley, would have welcomed Lincoln's withdrawal.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Roscoe
Conkling, being advised of the scheme, promptly rejected it. &quot;I do not
approve of the call or of the movement,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and cannot sign
it. For that reason it would not be proper or agreeable that I should
be present at the conference you speak of.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>It is doubtful if Lincoln knew of this conspiracy, but his friends
informed him of the critical condition of affairs. &quot;When, ten days
ago, I told Mr. Lincoln that his re-election was an impossibility,&quot;
Weed wrote Seward on August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.105" id="Page_iii.105">iii. 105</a></span> 22, &quot;I told him the information would
also come through other channels. It has doubtless reached him ere
this. At any rate nobody here doubts it, nor do I see anybody from
other States who authorises the slightest hope of success. The people
are wild for peace. They are told the President will only listen to
terms of peace on condition that slavery be abandoned.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Weed's
&quot;other channels&quot; meant a report from the Republican National Executive
Committee, which Raymond, then its chairman, submitted to Lincoln on
August 22. &quot;The tide is setting strongly against us,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Hon.
E.B. Washburn writes that 'were an election to be held now in Illinois
we should be beaten.' Mr. Cameron says that Pennsylvania is against
us. Governor Morton writes that nothing but the most strenuous efforts
can carry Indiana. This State, according to the best information I can
get, would go 50,000 against us to-morrow. And so of the rest. Two
special causes are assigned for this great reaction in public
sentiment&#8212;the want of military successes, and the impression in some
minds, the fear and suspicion in others, that we are not to have peace
in any event under this Administration until slavery is abandoned. In
some way or other the suspicion is widely diffused that we can have
peace with Union if we would. It is idle to reason with this
belief&#8212;still more idle to denounce it. It can only be expelled by
some authoritative act at once bold enough to fix attention, and
distinct enough to defy incredulity and challenge respect.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>In December, 1860, in the presence of threatened war Lincoln refused
to yield to a compromise that would extend slavery into free
territory; now, in the presence of failure at the polls, he insisted
upon a peace that would abolish slavery. In 1860 he was flushed with
victory; in 1864 he was depressed by the absence of military
achievement. But he did not weaken. He telegraphed Grant to &quot;hold on
with a bulldog grip, <i>and chew and choke as much as possible</i>,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.106" id="Page_iii.106">iii. 106</a></span> then, in the silence of early morning, with Raymond's starless
letter on the table before him, he showed how coolly and magnanimously
a determined patriot could face political overthrow. &quot;This morning, as
for some days past,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it seems exceedingly probable that
this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to
so co&#246;perate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the
election and the inauguration, as he will have secured his election on
such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The influence of this popular discouragement exhibited itself in a
mass peace convention, called by Fernando Wood and held at Syracuse on
August 18. Its great attraction was Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio,
its platform favoured an armistice and a convention of States, and its
purpose was the selection of a delegation to Chicago, which should
adequately represent the peace faction of the State. The absence of
military achievement and the loud cries for peace, it was claimed, had
changed the conditions since the adjournment of the Democratic State
convention in February, and the necessity for a third party was
conceded should the existing peace sentiment be ignored in the
formulation of a platform and the selection of candidates at Chicago.
Although the assembly indicated no preference for President, its known
partiality for Seymour added to its strength. Through the manipulation
of Richmond and the Regency, Wood failed to secure the appointment of
delegates, but he claimed, with much show of truth, that the meeting
represented the sentiment of a great majority of the party. Wood had
become intolerable to Dean Richmond and the conservative Democracy,
whose withering opposition to his candidacy for the United States
Senate in the preceding February had made him ridiculous; but he could
not be muzzled, and although his influence rarely disturbed the party
in the up-State counties, he was destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.107" id="Page_iii.107">iii. 107</a></span> to continue in Congress the
rest of his life, which ended in 1881.</p>

<p>The Democratic national convention had been called for July 4, but the
popular depression, promising greater advantage later in the summer,
led to its postponement until August 29. Thus it convened when gloom
and despondency filled the land, making Horatio Seymour's journey to
Chicago an ovation. At every stop, especially at Detroit, crowds,
cheers, speeches, and salvos of firearms greeted him. The convention
city recognised him as its most distinguished visitor, and the
opponents of a war policy, voicing the party's sentiment for peace,
publicly proclaimed him their favourite.</p>

<p>Before Seymour left Albany the <i>Argus</i> announced that he would not be
a candidate;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> but now, flattered by attention, and encouraged by
the peace-faction's strategic movement, he declined to indicate his
position. Political conditions had made a profound impression upon
him. Moreover, deep in his heart Seymour did not fancy McClellan. His
public life had been brief, and his accomplishment little either as a
soldier or civilian. Besides, his arrest of the Maryland Legislature,
and his indifference to the sacredness of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
classing him among those whom the Governor had bitterly denounced,
tended to destroy the latter's strongest argument against the Lincoln
administration.</p>

<p>Dean Richmond, now a vigorous supporter of McClellan, could not be
confused as to the General's strength or the Governor's weakness, and
he attempted at an early hour to silence the appeal for Seymour by
solidifying the New York delegation for McClellan; but in these
efforts he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.108" id="Page_iii.108">iii. 108</a></span> it difficult to subdue the personal independence and
outspoken ways of the Governor, whose opposition to McClellan was more
than a passing cloud-shadow.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> This delayed matters. So long as a
ray of hope existed for the favourite son, the New York delegation
declined to be forced into an attitude of opposition. Indeed, the day
before the convention opened, it refused, by a vote of 38 to 23, to
ascertain its choice for President. When, at last, it became
definitely known that McClellan had a majority of each State
delegation, practically assuring his nomination under the two-thirds
rule on the first ballot, Seymour put an end to the talk of his
candidacy. Nevertheless, his vote, dividing the New York delegation,
was cast for Samuel Nelson, the distinguished jurist who had succeeded
Smith Thompson as an associate justice of the United States Supreme
Court. Other anti-McClellan New York delegates preferred Charles
O'Conor and James Guthrie of Kentucky. Subsequently, in explaining his
action, Seymour disclaimed any doubt of the ability or patriotism of
the late commander of the Army of the Potomac.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The New York delegation had as usual a strong if not a controlling
influence in the convention. Dean Richmond who led it at Charleston
and Baltimore again guided its counsels, while the presence of John
Ganson and Albert P. Laning of Buffalo, and Francis Kernan of Utica,
added to its forcefulness upon the floor. Next to Seymour, however,
its most potent member for intellectual combat was Samuel J. Tilden,
who served upon the committee on resolutions. Tilden, then fifty years
old, was without any special charm of person or grace of manner. He
looked like an invalid. His voice was feeble, his speech neither
fluent nor eloquent, and sometimes he gave the impression of
indecision. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.109" id="Page_iii.109">iii. 109</a></span> his logic was irresistible, his statements
exhaustive, and his ability as a negotiator marvellous and unequalled.
He was the strong man of the committee, and his presence came very
near making New York the dominant factor in the convention.</p>

<p>Tilden's sympathies leaned toward the South. He resented the formation
of the Republican party,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> maintained that a State could repel
coercion as a nation might repel invasion,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> declared at the
Tweddle Hall meeting in January, 1861, that he &quot;would resist the use
of force to coerce the South into the Union,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and declined to
sign the call for the patriotic uprising of the people in Union Square
on April 20.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> On the other hand, he addressed departing regiments,
gave money, and in 1862 wrote: &quot;Within the Union we will give you [the
South] the Constitution you profess to revere, renewed with fresh
guarantees of equal rights and equal safety. We will give you
everything that local self-government demands; everything that a
common ancestory of glory&#8212;everything that national fraternity or
Christian fellowship requires; but to dissolve the federal bond
between these States, to dismember our country, whoever else consents,
we will not. No; never, never never!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Yet in February, 1863, in
opposition to the Loyal Publication Society, he assisted in organising
a local society which published and distributed &quot;Copperhead&quot;
literature.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He had not, however, been active in politics since
his defeat for attorney-general in 1855. It was during these years
that he began the accumulation of his large fortune. He acquired
easily. He seemed to know intuitively when to buy and when to sell,
and he profited by the rare opportunities offered during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.110" id="Page_iii.110">iii. 110</a></span> the great
depreciation in government bonds. Later, he dealt in railroads, his
private gains being so enormous that men thought his ambition for
wealth unscrupulously selfish.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been his sentiments respecting the war, Tilden
had little liking for Vallandigham in 1864, and after a bitter contest
finally defeated him for chairman of the committee on resolutions by a
vote of thirteen to eleven in favour of James Guthrie of Kentucky. He
also defeated a measure introduced by Washington Hunt suggesting an
armistice and a convention of States, and supported a positive
declaration that he thought sufficient to hold the war vote. However,
the dread of a split, such as had occurred at Charleston and Baltimore
in 1860, possessed the committee, and in the confusion of the last
moment, by a slight majority, the pivotal declaration pronouncing the
war a failure was accepted.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Seymour's election as permanent chairman of the convention gave him
abundant opportunity to proclaim his abhorrence of the Administration.
His speech, prepared with unusual care, showed the measured dignity
and restraint of a trained orator, who knew how to please a popular
audience with a glowing denunciation of principles it detested. Every
appeal was vivid and dramatic; every allusion told. Throughout the
whole ran the thread of one distinct proposition,&#8212;that the Republican
party had sinned away its day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.111" id="Page_iii.111">iii. 111</a></span> of grace, and that the patriotic work
of the Democratic party must begin at once if the Union was to be
saved. To Seymour it was not a new proposition. He had stated it in
the last campaign and reiterated it in his latest message; but never
before did he impress it by such striking sentences as now fell upon
the ears of a delighted convention. &quot;Even now, when war has desolated
our land,&quot; he said, &quot;has laid its heavy burdens upon labor, when
bankruptcy and ruin overhang us, this Administration will not have
Union except upon conditions unknown to our Constitution; it will not
allow the shedding of blood to cease, even for a little time, to see
if Christian charity or the wisdom of statesmanship may not work out a
method to save our country. Nay, more than this, it will not listen to
a proposal for peace which does not offer that which this government
has no right to ask. This Administration cannot now save this Union,
if it would. It has, by its proclamations, by vindictive legislation,
by displays of hate and passion, placed obstacles in its own pathway
which it cannot overcome, and has hampered its own freedom of action
by unconstitutional acts. The bigotry of fanatics and the intrigues of
placemen have made the bloody pages of the history of the past three
years.&quot;</p>

<p>It was impossible not to be impressed by such an impassioned lament.
There was also much in Seymour himself as well as in his words to
attract the attention of the convention.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Added years gave him a
more stately, almost a picturesque bearing, while a strikingly
intelligent face changed its expression with the ease and swiftness of
an actor's. This was never more apparent than now, when he turned,
abruptly, from the alleged sins of Republicans to the alleged virtues
of Democrats. Relaxing its severity, his counte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.112" id="Page_iii.112">iii. 112</a></span>nance wore a
triumphant smile as he declared in a higher and more resonant key,
that &quot;if this Administration cannot save the Union, <i>we can</i>! Mr.
Lincoln values many things above the Union; we put it first of all. He
thinks a proclamation worth more than peace; we think the blood of our
people more precious than the edicts of the President. There are no
hindrances in our pathway to Union and to peace. We demand no
conditions for the restoration of our Union; we are shackled with no
hates, no prejudices, no passions. We wish for fraternal relationships
with the people of the South. We demand for them what we demand for
ourselves&#8212;the full recognition of the rights of States. We mean that
every star on our Nation's banner shall shine with an equal
lustre.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> As the speaker concluded, the audience, with deafening
applause, testified its approval of these sentiments. Yet one wonders
that he could end without saying a word, at least, in condemnation of
the Secessionists, whose appeal from the ballot to the bullet had
inaugurated &quot;the bloody pages of the history of the past three years.&quot;</p>

<p>The platform, adopted without debate, reaffirmed devotion to the
Union, expressed sympathy with soldiers and prisoners of war,
denounced interference in military elections, and stigmatised alleged
illegal and arbitrary acts of the government. The second resolution,
prepared by Vallandigham, declared that &quot;this convention does
explicitly resolve as the sense of the American people, that after
four years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war,
justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare demand that
immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view
to an ultimate convention of the States, or other peaceable means, to
the end that the earliest practicable moment peace may be restored on
the basis of the Federal Union of the States.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.113" id="Page_iii.113">iii. 113</a></span></p>
<p>It is difficult to excuse Tilden's silence when this fatal resolution
was adopted. In the final haste to report the platform, the deep
significance of Vallandigham's words may not have been fully
appreciated by the Committee;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> but Tilden understood their
meaning, and vigorous opposition might have avoided them.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> He
seems, however, to have shared the fear of McClellan's friends that
the defeat of the resolution would endanger the integrity of the
convention, and to have indulged the hope that McClellan's letter of
acceptance would prove an antidote to the Ohioan's peace-poison. But
his inaction did little credit either to his discernment or judgment,
for the first ballot for President disclosed the groundlessness of his
timidity,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and the first work of the campaign revealed the
inefficiency of the candidate's statements.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Indeed, so grievous
was Tilden's mistake that his distinguished biographer (Bigelow)
avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.114" id="Page_iii.114">iii. 114</a></span> his responsibility for declaring the war a failure by
ignoring his presence at Chicago.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cheers for McClellan that greeted the returning
delegates were mingled with those of the country over Sherman's
capture of Atlanta and Farragut's destruction of the Mobile forts.</p>

<h2>FENTON DEFEATS SEYMOUR</h2>

<h2>1864</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> brilliant victories of Sherman and Farragut had an appreciable
effect upon Republicans. It brought strong hope of political success,
and made delegates to the Syracuse convention (September 7) very
plucky. Weed sought to control, but the Radicals, in the words of
Burke's famous sentence, were lords of the ascendant. They proposed to
nominate Reuben E. Fenton, and although the Chautauquan's popularity
and freedom from the prejudices of Albany politics commended him to
the better judgment of all Republicans, the followers of Greeley
refused to consult the Conservatives respecting him or any part of the
ticket. Resenting such treatment Weed indicated an inclination to
secede, and except that his regard for Fenton steadied him the
historic bolt of the Silver Grays might have been repeated.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Fenton was a well-to-do business man, without oratorical gifts or
statesmanlike qualities, but with a surpassing genius for public life.
He quickly discerned the drift of public sentiment and had seldom made
a glaring mistake. He knew, also, how to enlist other men in his
service and attach them to his fortunes. During his ten years in
Congress he developed a faculty for organisation, being able to
co&#246;rdinate all his resources and to bring them into their place in the
accomplishment of his purposes. This was conspicuously illustrated in
the Thirty-seventh Congress when he formed a combination that made
Galusha A. Grow speaker of the House. Besides, by careful attention to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.116" id="Page_iii.116">iii. 116</a></span> wants of constituents and to the work of the House, backed by the
shrewdness of a typical politician who rarely makes an enemy, he was
recognised as a sagacious counsellor and safe leader. He had
previously been mentioned for governor, and in the preceding winter
Theodore M. Pomeroy, then representing the Auburn district in
Congress, presented him for speaker.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Schuyler Colfax controlled
the caucus, but the compliment expressed the esteem of Fenton's
colleagues.</p>

<p>He was singularly striking and attractive in person, tall, erect, and
graceful in figure, with regular features and wavy hair slightly
tinged with gray. His sloping forehead, full at the eyebrows,
indicated keen perceptive powers. He was suave in address, so suave,
indeed, that his enemies often charged him with insincerity and even
duplicity, but his gracious manner, exhibited to the plainest woman
and most trifling man, won the hearts of the people as quickly as his
political favours recruited the large and devoted following that
remained steadfast to the end. Perhaps no one in his party presented a
stronger running record. He belonged to the Barnburners, he presided
at the birth of the Republican party, he stood for a vigorous
prosecution of the war regardless of the fate of slavery, and he had
avoided the Weed-Greeley quarrels. If he was not a statesman, he at
least possessed the needed qualities to head the State ticket.</p>

<p>As usual John A. Dix's name came before the convention. It was well
known that party nomenclature did not represent his views, but his
admirers, profoundly impressed with his sterling integrity and weight
of character, insisted, amidst the loudest cheering of the day, that
his name be presented. Nevertheless, an informal ballot quickly
disclosed that Fenton was the choice, and on motion of Elbridge G.
Lapham the nomination became unanimous.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.117" id="Page_iii.117">iii. 117</a></span> Other nominations fell
to the Radicals.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Not until Greeley was about to capture first
place as a presidential elector-at-large, however, did the
Conservatives fully realise how badly they were being punished. Then
every expedient known to diplomacy was exhausted. Afternoon shaded
into evening and evening into night. Still the contest continued. It
seems never to have occurred to the Weed faction that Horace Greeley,
whom it had so often defeated, could be given an office, even though
its duties covered but a single day, and in its desperation it
discovered a willingness to compromise on any other name. But
Greeley's friends forced the fight, and to their great joy won a most
decisive victory.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>While the Weed men were nursing their resentment because of the honour
thus suddenly thrust upon the most famous American editor,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> a
great surprise convulsed the Democratic State convention.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The
report that Horatio Seymour sought release from official labours
because of ill health and the demands of private business, created the
belief that he would decline a renomination even if tendered by
acclamation. Indeed, the Governor himself, in conversation with Dean
Richmond, reiterated his oft-expressed determination not to accept.
The Regency, believing him sincere, agreed upon William F. Allen of
Oswego, although other candidates, notably William Kelly of Dutchess,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.118" id="Page_iii.118">iii. 118</a></span> nominee of the Softs in 1860, and Amasa J. Parker of Albany, were
mentioned. Lucius Robinson, declining to be considered for second
place, urged the nomination of Dix for governor. Of these candidates
Seymour was quoted as favourable to Parker. Still a feeling of unrest
disturbed the hotel lobbies. &quot;There is some talk,&quot; said the <i>Herald</i>,
&quot;of giving Seymour a complimentary vote, with the understanding that
he will then decline, but this is opposed as a trick to place him in
the field again, although those who pretend to speak for him
positively declare that he will not accept the nomination upon any
contingency.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> When told on convention morning that Seymour would
accept if nominated by acclamation, Richmond ridiculed the idea. His
incredulity was strengthened by the statement of two Oneida delegates,
whom the Governor, only a few moments before, had instructed to
withdraw his name if presented. Thus matters stood until the
convention, having enthusiastically applauded an indorsement of
Seymour's administration, quickly and by acclamation carried a motion
for his renomination, the delegates jumping to their feet and giving
cheer after cheer. Immediately a delegate, rising to a question of
privilege, stated that the Governor, in the hearing of gentlemen from
his own county, had positively declined to accept a nomination because
his health and the state of his private affairs forbade it. As this
did not satisfy the delegates, a committee, appointed to notify
Seymour of his selection, reported that the Governor whose temporary
illness prevented his attendance upon the convention, had had much to
say about private affairs, ill health, and excessive labour, but that
since the delegates insisted upon his renomination, he acquiesced in
their choice.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Seymour's action was variously interpreted. Some pronounced it tricky;
others, that he declined because he feared defeat.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> But there was
no evidence of insincerity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.119" id="Page_iii.119">iii. 119</a></span> wanted the office less in 1864 than he
did in 1862. It had brought labour and anxiety, and no relief from
increasing solicitude was in sight if re-elected. But his friends,
resenting the New York delegation's action in withholding from him its
support for President, determined to be avenged by renominating him
for governor. They knew that Dean Richmond, whose admiration for the
Governor had not been increased by the latter's performance at
Chicago, wanted a candidate of more pronounced views respecting a
vigorous prosecution of the war, and that in his support of Allen he
had the convention well in hand. Wisely distrusting the Regency,
therefore, they worked in secret, talking of the honour and prestige
of a complimentary vote, but always declaring, what Seymour himself
emphasised, that the Governor would not again accept the office. Not a
misstep left its print in the proceedings. Before the chairman put the
motion for his renomination, a delegate from Oneida, rising to
withdraw the name, was quieted by the assurance that it was only
complimentary. An Albany lieutenant of Dean Richmond, obtaining the
floor with the help of a stentorian voice, began to block the
movement, but quickly subsided after hearing the explanation from a
delegate at his side that it was only complimentary. When the motion
had carried, however, and the Oneida gentleman began fulfilling the
Governor's directions, came the cry, &quot;Too late, too late. We have
nominated the candidate!&quot; So perfectly was the <i>coup d'&#233;tat</i> arranged
that the prime mover of the scheme was appointed chairman of the
committee to wait upon the Governor. Afterwards people recalled, with
a disposition to connect Seymour with this master-stroke in politics,
that he had never declined by letter, and that the rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.120" id="Page_iii.120">iii. 120</a></span>sons given,
like the illness that kept him from facing the convention, were
largely imaginary. &quot;That crowd saw how beautifully they were done,&quot;
said Depew, then secretary of state at Albany, &quot;while Dean Richmond's
language was never printed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely had the convention adjourned before the brilliant
achievements in the Shenandoah valley thrilled the North from Maine to
California. On September 19, at the battle of Winchester, General
Sheridan defeated General Early, and on the 22d, at Fisher's Hill, put
him to flight. &quot;Only darkness,&quot; Sheridan telegraphed Grant, &quot;has saved
the whole of Early's army from total destruction. I do not think there
ever was an army so badly routed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> These victories, recalling
those of Stonewall Jackson in 1862, appealed to the popular
imagination and quickly reassured the country. Besides, on September
21, the withdrawal of Fremont and Cochrane, the Cleveland candidates,
united Radical and Conservative in a vigorous campaign for Lincoln. A
private letter from Grant, who participated in the glory accorded
Sherman and Sheridan, told the true condition of the Confederacy. &quot;The
rebels,&quot; he said, &quot;have now in their ranks their last man. They have
robbed the cradle and the grave equally to get their present force.
Besides what they lose in frequent skirmishes and battles, they are
now losing, from desertions and other causes, at least one regiment
per day. With this drain upon them the end is not far distant, if we
only be true to ourselves.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.121" id="Page_iii.121">iii. 121</a></span></p><p>This story, coupled with recent victories, turned the Democratic
platform into a lie. Instead of being a failure, the war was now
recognised as a grand success, and radical speakers, replying to the
clamour for a cessation of hostilities, maintained that the abolition
of slavery was the only condition that promised a permanent peace.
Brilliant descriptions of Grant's work, aided by his distinguished
lieutenants, were supplemented later in the campaign by the recital of
&quot;Sheridan's Ride,&quot; which produced the wildest enthusiasm. Indeed, the
influence of the army's achievements, dissipating the despondency of
the summer months, lifted the campaign into an atmosphere of
patriotism not before experienced since the spring of 1861, and
established the belief that Lincoln's re-election meant the end of
secession and slavery. &quot;There will be peace,&quot; said John Cochrane, &quot;but
it will be the peace which the musket gives to a conquered host.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Referring to the farewell speech of Alexander H. Stephens upon his
retirement from public life in 1859, George William Curtis, with the
eloquence that adorned his addresses at that period, thrilled his
audience with an exciting war picture: &quot;Listen to Mr. Stephens in the
summer sunshine six years ago. 'There is not now a spot of the public
territory of the United States over which the national flag floats
where slavery is excluded by the law of Congress, and the highest
tribunal of the land has decided that Congress has no power to make
such a law. At this time there is not a ripple upon the surface. The
country was never in a profounder quiet.' Do you comprehend the
terrible significance of those words? He stops; he sits down. The
summer sun sets over the fields of Georgia. Good-night, Mr.
Stephens&#8212;a long good-night. Look out from your window&#8212;how calm it
is! Upon Missionary Ridge, upon Lookout Mountain, upon the heights of
Dalton, upon the spires of Atlanta, silence and solitude; the peace of
the Southern policy of slavery and death. But look! Hark! Through the
great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.122" id="Page_iii.122">iii. 122</a></span> five years before you a light is shining&#8212;a sound is ringing.
It is the gleam of Sherman's bayonets, it is the roar of Grant's guns,
it is the red daybreak and wild morning music of peace indeed, the
peace of national life and liberty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>The sulkers now came out of their tents. Daniel S. Dickinson, no
longer peddling his griefs in private ears, declared &quot;there was no
doubt of the President's triumphant election;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> the tone of Bryant
and the <i>Evening Post</i> changed; Beecher renewed hope through the
<i>Independent</i> and preached a political sermon every Sunday evening;
Weed and Raymond discontinued their starless letters to Lincoln;
George Opdyke cancelled the call for a second national convention and
another candidate for President; and Horace Greeley, silent as to his
part in the recent conspiracy, joined the army of Union orators.
Catching again the spirit of the great moral impulse and that lofty
enthusiasm which had aroused the people of the North to the decisive
struggle against slavery, these leaders sprang to the work of
advancing the cause of liberty and human rights.</p>

<p>The Democrats sought to evade Vallandigham's words of despair, written
into the Chicago platform, by eulogising McClellan, but as the glory
of Antietam paled in the presence of Sherman's and Sheridan's
victories, they declared that success in the field did not mean peace.
&quot;Armed opposition is driven from the fields of Kentucky, Missouri,
Maryland, and parts of Louisiana,&quot; said Horatio Seymour, &quot;and yet this
portion of country, already conquered, requires more troops to hold it
under military rule than are demanded for our armies to fight the
embattled forces of the Confederacy. You will find that more men will
be needed to keep the South in subjection to the arbitrary projects of
the Administration than are required to drive the armies of rebellion
from the field. The peace you are promised is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.123" id="Page_iii.123">iii. 123</a></span> no peace, but is a
condition which will perpetuate and make enduring all the worst
features of this war.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>In their eagerness Democratic speakers, encouraged by the New York
<i>World</i>, then the ablest and most influential journal of its party,
turned with bitterness, first upon Lincoln's administration, and
finally upon Lincoln himself. &quot;Is Mr. Lincoln honest?&quot; asked the
<i>World</i>. &quot;That he has succumbed to the opportunities and temptations
of his present place is capable of the easiest proof.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> This was
sufficient for the stump orator and less influential journal to base
angry and extravagant charges of wrong-doing, which became frequent
and noisy.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> John Van Buren called Lincoln a &quot;twenty-second-rate
man,&quot; and declared the country &quot;irretrievably gone&quot; if McClellan was
defeated.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Seymour did not charge Lincoln with personal
dishonesty, but he thought his administration had rendered itself a
partner in fraud and corruption. &quot;I do not mean to say,&quot; he declared,
&quot;that the Administration is to be condemned because, under
circumstances so unusual as those which have existed during this war,
bad men have taken advantage of the confusion in affairs to do wrong.
But I do complain that when these wrongs are done, the Government
deliberately passes laws that protect the doer, and thus make
wrong-doing its own act. Moreover, in an election like this, when the
Government is spending such an enormous amount of money, and the
liability to peculation is so great, the Administration that will say
to contractors, as has been openly said in circulars, 'You have had a
good contract, out of which you have made money, and we expect you to
use a part of that money to assist to replace us in power,' renders
itself a partner in fraud and corruption.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.124" id="Page_iii.124">iii. 124</a></span></p><p>After Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana swung into line on October 10 no
doubt remained as to the general result. But Republican confidence in
New York was greatly shaken by the disclosure of a conspiracy to use
the soldier vote for fraudulent purposes. Under an amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in March, 1864, soldiers in the field were
allowed to vote, provided properly executed proxies were delivered to
election inspectors in their home districts within sixty days next
previous to the election, and to facilitate the transmission of such
proxies agents for the State were appointed at Baltimore, Washington,
and other points. Several of these agents, charged with forgery, were
arrested by the military authorities, one of whom confessed that
enough forged proxies had been forwarded from Washington &quot;to fill a
dry-goods box.&quot; Of these spurious ballots several hundred were seized,
and two of the forgers committed to the penitentiary.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> &quot;We are
informed,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;that Oswego county is flooded with
spurious McClellan votes of every description. There are forged votes
from living as well as from dead soldiers; fictitious votes from
soldiers whose genuine votes and powers of attorney are in the hands
of their friends. These packages correspond with the work described in
the recent Baltimore investigation.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Meantime Governor Seymour,
uneasy lest the liberties of his agents be limited, directed Amasa J.
Parker, William F. Allen, and William Kelly to proceed to Washington
and &quot;vindicate the laws of the State&quot; and &quot;expose all attempts to
prevent soldiers from voting, or to detain or alter the votes already
cast.&quot; These commissioners, after a hurried investigation, reported
that &quot;although there may have been irregularities, they have found no
evidence that any frauds have been committed by any person connected
with the New York agency.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Nevertheless, the sequel showed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.125" id="Page_iii.125">iii. 125</a></span>
this plot, if not discovered, would probably have changed the result
in the State.</p>

<p>During the last month of the campaign the interest of the whole
country centred in New York. Next to the election of Lincoln,
Republicans everywhere desired the defeat of Seymour. To them his
speech at Chicago had been a malignant indictment of the Government,
and his one address in the campaign, while it did not impute personal
dishonesty to the President, had branded his administration as a party
to fraud. Lincoln regarded the contest in New York as somewhat
personal to himself, and from day to day sought information with the
anxious persistency that characterised his inquiries during the
canvass in 1860. Fenton fully appreciated the importance of
vindicating the President, and for the admirable thoroughness of the
campaign he received great credit.</p>

<p>After the polls had closed on November 8 it soon became known that
although the President had 179 electoral votes to 21 for McClellan,
New York was in grave doubt. On Wednesday approximated returns put
Republicans 1,400 ahead. Finally it developed that in a total vote of
730,821, Lincoln had 6,749 more than McClellan, and Fenton 8,293 more
than Seymour. Fenton's vote exceeded Lincoln's by 1,544. &quot;We believe
this the only instance,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;in which a Republican
candidate for governor polled a heavier vote than that cast for our
candidate for President at the same election.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The Legislature
was largely Republican, and the twenty congressmen, a gain of five,
included Roscoe Conkling and John A. Griswold, an intrepid, energetic
spirit&#8212;the very incarnation of keen good sense. Like Erastus Corning,
whom he succeeded in Congress, Griswold was a business man, whose
intelligent interest in public affairs made him mayor of Troy at the
age of twenty-eight. In 1862 he carried his district as a Democrat by
over 2,000 majority, but developing more political independence than
friend or foe had anticipated, he refused to follow his party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.126" id="Page_iii.126">iii. 126</a></span> in war
legislation, and with Moses F. Odell, a Democratic colleague from
Brooklyn, boldly supported the Thirteenth Amendment. This made him a
Republican.</p>

<p>To this galaxy also belonged Henry J. Raymond. He had come into
possession of great fame. His graceful and vigorous work on the
<i>Times</i>, supplemented by his incisive speeches and rare intelligence
in conventions, had won many evidences of his party's esteem, but with
a desire for office not less pronounced than Greeley's<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> he coveted
a seat in Congress from a district which gave a Tammany majority of
2,000 in 1862. To the surprise of his friends he won by a plurality of
386. It was the greatest victory of the year, and, in the end, led to
the saddest event of his life.</p>

<h2>A COMPLETE CHANGE OF POLICY</h2>

<h2>1865</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">For</span> the moment the surrender of Lee and the collapse of the
Confederacy left the Democrats without an issue. The war had not been
a failure, peace had come without the intervention of a convention of
the States, the South was &quot;subjugated,&quot; the abolition of slavery
accomplished, arbitrary arrests were forgotten, the professed fear of
national bankruptcy had disappeared, and Seymour's prophetic gift was
in eclipse. Nothing had happened which he predicted&#8212;everything had
transpired which he opposed. Meanwhile, under the administration of
Andrew Johnson, the country was gradually recovering from the awful
shock of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.</p>

<p>Substantially following Lincoln's policy, the President had issued, on
May 29, 1865, a proclamation of amnesty pardoning such as had
participated in rebellion,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> with restoration of all rights of
property except as to slaves, on condition that each take an oath to
support the Constitution and to obey the laws respecting emancipation.
He also prescribed a mode for the reconstruction of States lately in
rebellion. This included the appointment of provisional governors
authorised to devise the proper machinery for choosing legislatures,
which should determine the qualifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.128" id="Page_iii.128">iii. 128</a></span>tion of electors and
office-holders. In this preliminary scheme Johnson limited the voters
to white men. Personally he declared himself in favour of a qualified
suffrage for negroes, but he thought this a matter to be determined by
the States themselves.</p>

<p>A policy that excluded the negro from all participation in public
affairs did not commend itself to the leaders of the Radicals. It was
believed that Mississippi's denial of even a limited suffrage to the
negro, such as obtained in New York, indicated the feeling of the
Southern people, and the Union conventions of Pennsylvania, dominated
by Thaddeus Stevens, and of Massachusetts, controlled by Charles
Sumner, refused to endorse the President's scheme. During the summer
Horace Greeley, in several earnest and able editorials, advocated
negro suffrage as a just and politic measure, but he carefully avoided
any reflection upon the President, and disclaimed the purpose of
making such suffrage an inexorable condition in reconstruction.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
Nevertheless, the Radicals of the State hesitated to leave the civil
status of coloured men to their former masters.</p>

<p>Johnson's policy especially appealed to the Democrats, and at their
State convention, held at Albany on September 9 (1865), they promised
the President their cordial support, commended his reconstruction
policy, pledged the payment of the war debt, thanked the army and
navy, and denounced the denial &quot;of representation to States in order
to compel them to adopt negro equality or negro suffrage as an element
of their Constitutions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Indeed, with one stroke of the pen the
convention erased all issues of the war, and with one stroke of the
axe rid itself of the men whom it held responsible for defeat. It
avoided Seymour for president of the convention; it nominated for
secretary of state Henry W. Slocum of Onondaga, formerly a Republican
office-holder, whose superb leadership as a corps commander placed
him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.129" id="Page_iii.129">iii. 129</a></span> among New York's most famous soldiers; it preferred John Van
Buren to Samuel J. Tilden for attorney-general; and it refused Manton
Marble's platform, although the able editor of the <i>World</i> enjoyed the
hospitality of the committee room. Further to popularise its action,
it welcomed back to its fold Lucius Robinson, whom it nominated for
comptroller, an office he was then holding by Republican suffrage.</p>

<p>Robinson's political somersault caused no surprise. His dislike of the
Lincoln administration, expressed in his letter to the Cleveland
convention, influenced him to support McClellan, while the Radicals'
tendency to accept negro suffrage weakened his liking for the
Republican party. However, no unkind words followed his action.
&quot;Robinson is to-day,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;what he has always been, a
genuine Democrat, a true Republican, a hearty Unionist, and an
inflexibly honest and faithful guardian of the treasury. He has proved
a most valuable officer, whom every would-be plunderer of the State
regards with unfeigned detestation, and, if his old associates like
him well enough to support his re-election, it is a proof that some of
the false gods they have for years been following have fallen from
their pedestals and been crumbled into dust.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The Union Republican convention, held at Syracuse on September 20,
followed the policy of the Democrats in the nomination of Slocum.
Officers of distinguished service abounded. Daniel E. Sickles, a hero
of Gettysburg; Francis G. Barlow, the intrepid general of Hancock's
famous corps; Henry W. Barnum, a soldier of decided valour and
energy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.130" id="Page_iii.130">iii. 130</a></span> Charles H. Van Wyck, who left Congress to lead a regiment to
the field; John H. Martindale, a West Point graduate of conspicuous
service in the Peninsular campaign, and Joseph Howland, whose large
means had benefited the soldiers, were especially mentioned. Of this
galaxy all received recognition save Sickles and Van Wyck, Chauncey M.
Depew being dropped for Barlow, Cochrane for Martindale, Bates for
Barnum, and Schuyler for Howland. In other words, the officials
elected in 1863, entitled by custom to a second term, yielded to the
sentiment that soldiers deserved recognition in preference to
civilians.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The question of negro suffrage troubled the convention. The Radicals
had a decided majority&#8212;&quot;not less than fifty,&quot; Greeley said; but Weed
and Raymond, now the acknowledged friends of the President, had the
power. Shortly after Johnson took the oath of office, Preston King
presented Weed to the new Executive and the three breakfasted
together. King's relations with the President bore the stamp of
intimacy. They had served together in Congress, and on March 4, 1865,
that ill-fated inauguration day when Johnson's intoxication humiliated
the Republic, King concealed him in the home of Francis P. Blair at
Silver Springs, near Washington.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> After Lincoln's death King
became for a time the President's constant adviser, and through his
influence, it was believed, Johnson foreshadowed in one of his early
speeches a purpose to pursue a more unfriendly policy towards the
South than his predecessor had intended. For a time it was thought
King would displace Seward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.131" id="Page_iii.131">iii. 131</a></span> the Cabinet if for no other reason than
because of the latter's part in defeating the former's re-election to
the Senate in 1863. However, differences between them were finally
adjusted by King's acceptance of the collectorship of the port of New
York in place of Draper. This, it was understood, meant a complete
reconciliation of all the factions in the State. Within sixty days
thereafter, King, in a moment of mental aberration, took his life by
jumping from a Jersey City ferry-boat.</p>

<p>There was something peculiarly pathetic in the passing of King. In
accepting the collectorship he yielded to the solicitation of friends
who urged him to retain it after his health, due to worry and
overwork, was seriously impaired. &quot;He thought it incumbent upon him,&quot;
says Weed, &quot;to sign nothing he did not personally examine, becoming
nervously apprehensive that his bondsmen might suffer.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> It was
surmised, also, that the President's change of policy occasioned him
extreme solicitude as well as much embarrassment, since the threatened
breach between President and Radicals made him sensitive as to his
future course. He was a Radical, and, deeply as he regarded the
President, he hesitated to hold an office, which, by associating him
with the Administration, would discredit his sincerity and deprive him
of the right to aid in overthrowing an obnoxious policy. Premeditated
suicide was shown by the purchase, while on his way to the ferry, of a
bag of shot which sank the body quickly and beyond immediate recovery.</p>

<p>Every delegate in the Syracuse convention knew that Weed's cordial
relations with Johnson, established through Preston King, made him the
undisputed dispenser of patronage. Nevertheless, the failure of
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts to endorse the President's policy,
supplemented by Mississippi's action, made a deep impression upon
radical delegates. Besides, it had already been noised abroad that
Johnson could not be influenced. Senator Wade of Ohio discovered it
early in July, and in August, after two at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.132" id="Page_iii.132">iii. 132</a></span>tempts, Stevens gave him up
as inexorable.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> &quot;If something is not done,&quot; wrote the
Pennsylvanian, &quot;the President will be crowned King before Congress
meets.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Under these circumstances the leading Radicals desired to
vote for a resolution affirming the right of all loyal people of the
South to a voice in reorganising and controlling their respective
State governments, and Greeley believed it would have secured a large
majority on a yea and nay vote.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> But Raymond resisted. His
friendship for Johnson exhibited at the Baltimore convention had
suddenly made him an acknowledged power with the new Administration
which he was soon to represent in Congress, and he did not propose
allowing the <i>Tribune's</i> editor to force New York into the list of
States that refused to endorse the President.</p>

<p>Such a course, he believed, would give the State to the Democrats,
whose prompt and intrepid confidence in the President had plainly
disconcerted the Republicans. Besides, Raymond disbelieved in the
views of the extreme Radicals, who held that States lately in
rebellion must be treated as conquered provinces and brought back into
the Union as new States, subject to conditions prescribed by their
conquerors. As chairman of the committee on resolutions, therefore,
the editor of the <i>Times</i> bore down heavily on the Radical dissenters,
and in the absence of a decided leader they allowed their devotion to
men to overbear attachment to principles. As finally adopted the
platform recognised Johnson's ability, patriotism, and integrity,
declared the war debt sacred, thanked the soldiers and sailors,
commended the President's policy of reconstruction, and expressed the
hope that when the States lately in rebellion are restored to the
exercise of their constitutional rights, &quot;it will be done in the faith
and on the basis that they will be exercised in the spirit of equal
and impartial justice, and with a view to the elevation and
perpetuation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.133" id="Page_iii.133">iii. 133</a></span> the full rights of citizenship of all their people,
inasmuch as these are principles which constitute the basis of our
republican institutions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Greeley pronounced this language &quot;timid
and windy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>In the campaign that followed the Democrats flattered the President,
very cleverly insisting that the Radicals' devotion to negro suffrage
made them his only real opponents. On the other hand, conservative
Republicans, maintaining that the convention did not commit itself to
an enfranchisement of the negro, insisted that it was a unit in its
support of the President's policy, and that the Democrats, acting
insincerely, sought to destroy the Union party and secure exclusive
control of the Executive. &quot;They propose,&quot; said the <i>Times</i>, &quot;to repeat
upon him precisely the trick which they practised with such brilliant
success upon John Tyler and Millard Fillmore, both of whom were taken
up by the Democracy, their policy endorsed, and their supporters
denounced. Both were flattered with the promise of a Democratic
nomination and both were weak enough to listen and yield to the
temptation. Both were used unscrupulously to betray their principles
and their friends, and when the time came both were remorselessly
thrown, like squeezed oranges, into the gutter. The game they are
playing upon President Johnson is precisely the same. They want the
offices he has in his gift, and when his friends are scattered and
overthrown they will have him at their mercy. Then, the power he gives
them will be used for his destruction.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Horatio Seymour made two speeches. With charming candor he admitted
that &quot;signal victories have been won by generals who have made the
history of our country glorious.&quot; But to him the great debt, the
untaxed bonds, the inflation of the currency, the increased prices,
and the absence of congressmen from the States lately in rebellion,
seemed as full of peril as war itself. In his address at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.134" id="Page_iii.134">iii. 134</a></span> Seneca Falls
his field of view, confined to war-burdens and rights withheld from
&quot;subjugated&quot; States, did not include the vision that thrilled others,
who saw the flag floating over every inch of American territory, now
forever freed from slavery. &quot;When we were free from debt,&quot; he said, &quot;a
man could support himself with six hours of daily toil. To-day he must
work two hours longer to pay his share of the national debt.... This
question of debt means less to give your families.... It reaches every
boy and girl, every wife and mother.... It affects the character of
our people.&quot; Prosperity also troubled him. &quot;We see upon every hand its
embarrassing effect. The merchant does not know whether he will be a
loser or gainer. We see men who have been ruined without fault, and
men who have made great fortunes without industry. Inquire of the
person engaged in mechanical operations and he will say that labour
has lost its former certain reward.&quot; He disapproved the national
banking act because the new banks &quot;have converted the debt of the
country into currency and inflated prices;&quot; he disputed the
correctness of the Treasury debt statement because &quot;it is the
experience of all wars that long after their close new claims spring
up, which render the expense at least fifty per cent. more than
appeared by the figures;&quot; and he condemned the national system of
taxation because it &quot;disables us to produce as cheaply at home as we
can buy in the markets of the world.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>The brief campaign promised to be spiritless and without incident
until John Van Buren, in his extended canvass for attorney-general,
freely expressed his opinion of Horatio Seymour. Van Buren was not an
admirer of that statesman. He had supported him with warmth in 1862,
but after the development of the Governor's &quot;passion for peace&quot; he had
little sympathy with and less respect for his administration. In the
campaign of 1864 he practically ignored him, and the subsequent
announcement of his defeat liberated Van Buren's tongue. &quot;Seymour is a
damned fool,&quot; he said. &quot;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.135" id="Page_iii.135">iii. 135</a></span> spoiled everything at Chicago, and has
been the cause of most of the disasters of the Democratic party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
At Troy he declared that &quot;the Democracy were suffering now from the
infernal blunder at Chicago last year,&quot; and that &quot;if Seymour and
Vallandigham had been kicked out of the national convention it would
have been a good thing for the party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>This opinion scarcely expressed the sentiment of a majority of
Democrats, but those who had preferred John A. Dix as the man of
destiny held Seymour and his school of statesmen responsible for the
party's deplorable condition. It had emerged from the war defeated in
every distinctive principle it had promulgated, and in the absence of
an available issue it now sought to atone for the past and to gain the
confidence of the people by nominating candidates who were either
active in the field or recognised as sincerely devoted to a vigorous
prosecution of the war. To aid in this new departure Van Buren threw
his old-time fire into the campaign, speaking daily and to the delight
of his audiences; but he soon discovered that things were looking
serious, and when the Union Republican ticket was elected by
majorities ranging from 28,000 to 31,000, with two-thirds of the
Assembly and all the senators save one, he recognised that the glory
of Lee's surrender and the collapse of the Confederacy did not
strengthen the Democratic party, although one of its candidates had
led an army corps, and another, with eloquence and irresistible
argument, had stirred the hearts of patriotic Americans in the darkest
hours of the rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<h2>RAYMOND CHAMPIONS THE PRESIDENT</h2>

<h2>1866</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">When</span> Congress convened in December, 1865, President Johnson, in a calm
and carefully prepared message, advocated the admission of Southern
congressmen whenever their States ratified the Thirteenth Amendment.
He also recommended that negro suffrage be left to the States. On the
other hand, extreme Radicals, relying upon the report of Carl Schurz,
whom the President had sent South on a tour of observation, demanded
suffrage and civil rights for the negro, and that congressional
representation be based upon actual voters instead of population.
Schurz had remained three months in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana, and to him &quot;treason, under existing
circumstances, does not appear odious in the South. The people are not
impressed with any sense of its criminality. And there is yet among
the Southern people an utter absence of national feeling.... While
accepting the abolition of slavery, they think that some species of
serfdom, peonage, or other form of compulsory labour is not slavery,
and may be introduced without a violation of their pledge.&quot; Schurz,
therefore, recommended negro suffrage as &quot;a condition precedent to
readmission.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>On the contrary, General Grant, who had spent a couple of weeks in the
South upon the invitation of the President, reported that the mass of
thinking men accepted conditions in good faith; that they regarded
slavery and the right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.137" id="Page_iii.137">iii. 137</a></span> secede as settled forever, and were anxious
to return to self-government within the Union as soon as possible;
that &quot;while reconstructing they want and require protection from the
government. They are in earnest in wishing to do what is required by
the government, not humiliating to them as citizens, and if such a
course was pointed out they would pursue it in good faith.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The North had been too happy over the close of the war and the return
of its soldiers to anticipate the next step, but when Thaddeus Stevens
of Pennsylvania, the leader of the Radicals, opened the discussion in
Congress on December 10 (1865), the people quickly saw the drift of
things. Stevens contended that hostilities had severed the original
contract between the Southern States and the Union, and that the
former, in order to return to the Union, must come in as new States
upon terms made by Congress and approved by the President. In like
manner he argued that negroes, if denied suffrage, should be excluded
from the basis of representation, thus giving the South 46
representatives instead of 83. &quot;But why should slaves be excluded?&quot;
demanded Stevens. &quot;This doctrine of a white man's government is as
atrocious as the infamous sentiment that damned the late Chief Justice
to everlasting fame, and, I fear, to everlasting fire.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Stevens' speech, putting Johnson's policy squarely in issue, was
answered by Henry J. Raymond, now the selected and acknowledged leader
of the Administration in the House. Raymond had entered Congress with
a prestige rarely if ever equalled by a new member. There had been
greater orators, abler debaters, and more profound statesmen, but no
one had ever preceded him with an environment more influential. He was
the favourite of the President; he had been brought into more or less
intimate association with all the men of his party worth knowing; he
was the close friend of Weed and the recognized ally of Seward; his
good will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.138" id="Page_iii.138">iii. 138</a></span> could make postmasters and collectors, and his displeasure,
like that of a frigid and bloodless leader, could carry swift penalty.
Indeed, there was nothing in the armory of the best equipped
politician, including able speaking and forceful writing, that he did
not possess, and out of New York as well as within it he had been
regarded the earnest friend and faithful champion of Republican
doctrines. On the surface, too, it is doubtful if a member of
Congress, whether new or old, ever seemed to have a better chance of
winning in a debate. Only three months before the people of the North,
with great unanimity, had endorsed the President and approved his
policy. Besides, the great body of Republicans in Congress preferred
to work with the President. He held the patronage, he had succeeded by
the assassin's work to the leadership of the party, and thus far had
evinced no more dogmatism than Stevens or Sumner. Moreover, the
sentiment of the North at that time was clearly against negro
suffrage. All the States save six<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> denied the vote to the negro,
and in the recent elections three States had specifically declared
against extending it to him.</p>

<p>Thus fortified Raymond did not object to speaking for the
Administration. To him Stevens' idea of subjecting the South to the
discipline and tutelage of Congress was repulsive, and his ringing
voice filled the spacious hall of the House with clear-cut sentences.
He denied that the Southern States had ever been out of the Union. &quot;If
they were,&quot; he asked, &quot;how and when did they become so? By what
specific act, at what precise time, did any one of those States take
itself out of the American Union? Was it by the ordinance of
secession? An ordinance of secession is simply a nullity, because it
encounters the Constitution which is the supreme law of the land. Did
the resolutions of those States, the declaration of their officials,
the speeches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.139" id="Page_iii.139">iii. 139</a></span> members of their Legislatures, or the utterances
of their press, accomplish the result desired? Certainly not. All
these were declarations of a purpose to secede. Their secession, if it
ever took place, certainly could not date from the time when their
intention to secede was first announced. They proceeded to sustain
their purpose of secession by arms against the force which the United
States brought to bear against them. Were their arms victorious? If
they were, then their secession was an accomplished fact. If not, it
was nothing more than an abortive attempt&#8212;a purpose unfulfilled. They
failed to maintain their ground by force of arms. In other words, they
failed to secede. But if,&quot; he concluded, &quot;the Southern States did go
out of the Union, it would make those in the South who resisted the
Confederacy guilty of treason to an independent government. Do you
want to make traitors out of loyal men?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>Raymond received close attention. Several leaders acknowledged their
interest by asking questions, and the congratulations that followed
evidenced the good will of his colleagues. His speech had shown none
of the usual characteristics of a maiden effort. Without advertising
his intention to speak, he obtained the floor late in the afternoon,
referred with spirit to the sentiments of the preceding speaker, and
moved along with the air of an old member, careless of making a
rhetorical impression but intensely in earnest in what he had to
present. As an argument in favor of the adoption of a liberal policy
toward the South, regardless of its strict legal rights, the speech
commended itself to his colleagues as an admirable one, but it
entirely failed to meet Stevens' logic that the States lately in
rebellion could not set up any rights against the conqueror except
such as were granted by the laws of war. In his reply the
Pennsylvanian taunted Raymond with failing to quote a single authority
in support of his contention. &quot;I admit the gravity of the gentleman's
opinion,&quot; he said, &quot;and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.140" id="Page_iii.140">iii. 140</a></span> the slightest corroborating authority
should yield the case. But without some such aid I am not willing that
the sages of the law&#8212;Grotius, Vattel, and a long line of
compeers&#8212;should be overthrown and demolished by the single arm of the
gentleman from New York. I pray the gentleman to quote authority; not
to put too heavy a load upon his own judgment; he might sink under the
weight. Give us your author.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>As the debate continued it became evident the President's friends were
losing ground. Aside from the withering blows of Stevens, unseen
occurrences which Raymond, in his eagerness to champion Johnson's
policy, did not appreciate or willingly ignored, had a most disturbing
influence. The Northern people welcomed peace and approved the
generosity of the government, but they wanted the South to exhibit its
appreciation by corresponding generosity to the government's friends.
Its acts did not show this. Enactments in respect to freedmen, passed
by the President's reconstructed legislatures, grudgingly bestowed
civil rights. A different punishment for the same offence was
prescribed for the negroes; apprentice, vagrant, and contract labour
laws tended to a system of peonage; and the prohibition of public
assemblies, the restriction of freedom of movement, and the
deprivation of means of defence illustrated the inequality of their
rights. Such laws, for whatever purpose passed, had a powerful effect
on Northern sentiment already influenced by reported cruelties, while
the Southern people's aversion to Union soldiers settling in their
midst intensified the feeling. Moreover, Southern and Democratic
support of the President made Republicans distrust his policy. If
States can be reconstructed in a summer and congressmen admitted in a
winter, it was said, the South, helped by the Democracy of the North,
might again be in control of the Government within two years. These
considerations were bound to affect the judgment of Republicans, and
when Stevens began to talk and the real condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.141" id="Page_iii.141">iii. 141</a></span>tions in the South came
to be known, it aroused party indignation to a high pitch in the
House.</p>

<p>Raymond, in his brilliant rejoinders, endeavoured to recover lost
ground. He had created no enemies. On the contrary his courtesy and
tact smoothed the way and made him friends. But after weeks of
discussion an effort to adopt a resolution of confidence in the
President met with overwhelming defeat. Stevens asked that the
resolution be referred to the Committee on Reconstruction&#8212;Raymond
demanded its adoption at once. On a roll-call the vote stood 32 to 107
in favour of reference, Raymond and William A. Darling of New York
City being the only Republicans to vote against it. It was a heavy
blow to the leader of the Conservatives. It proved the unpopularity of
Johnson's policy and indicated increasing estrangement between the
President and his party. Moreover, it was personally humiliating. On a
test question, with the whole power of the Administration behind him,
Raymond had been able, after weeks of work, to secure the support of
only one man and that a colleague bound to him by the ties of personal
friendship.</p>

<p>The division in the party spread with the rapidity of a rising thunder
cloud. On February 6 Congress passed the Freedman's Bureau Bill,
designed to aid helpless negroes, which the President vetoed. A month
later his treatment of the Civil Rights Bill, which set in motion the
necessary machinery to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment, shattered the
confidence of the party. &quot;Surely,&quot; declared Senator Trumbull of
Illinois, &quot;we have authority to enact a law as efficient in the
interest of freedom as we had in the interest of slavery.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> But
the President promptly vetoed it, because, he said, it conferred
citizenship on the negro, invaded the rights of the States, had no
warrant in the Constitution, and was contrary to all precedent.</p>

<p>The President had developed several undesirable characteristics, being
essentially obstinate and conceited, the pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.142" id="Page_iii.142">iii. 142</a></span>sessor of a bad temper,
and of a coarse and vulgar personality. His speech on February 22, in
which he had invoked the wild passions of a mob, modified the opinions
even of conservative men. &quot;It is impossible to conceive of a more
humiliating spectacle,&quot; said Sherman.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> &quot;During the progress of
events,&quot; wrote Weed, &quot;the President was bereft of judgment and reason,
and became the victim of passion and unreason.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But up to this
time the party had hoped to avoid a complete break with the Executive.
Now, however, the question of passing the Civil Rights Bill over his
veto presented itself. Not since the beginning of the government had
Congress carried an important measure over a veto. Besides, it meant a
complete and final separation between the President and his party.
Edwin D. Morgan so understood it, and although he had heretofore
sustained the President, he now stood with the Radicals. Raymond also
knew the gravity of the situation. But Raymond, who often wavered and
sometimes exhibited an astonishing fickleness,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> saw only one side
to the question, and on April 9 when the House, by a vote of 122 to
41, overrode the veto, he was one of only seven Unionists to support
the President.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>After the passage of the Civil Rights Bill the President's friends
proposed to invoke, through a National Union convention to be held at
Philadelphia on August 14, the sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.143" id="Page_iii.143">iii. 143</a></span>port of conservative Republicans
and Democrats. Weed told Raymond of the project and Seward urged it
upon him. Raymond expressed a disinclination to go to the convention
because it seemed likely to fall into the hands of former Confederates
and their Northern associates, and to be used for purposes hostile to
the Union party, of which, he said, he was not only a member, but the
chairman of its national committee. Seward did not concur in this
view. He said it was not a party convention and need not affect the
party standing of those who attended it. He was a Union man, he
declared, and he did not admit the right of anybody to turn him out of
the Union party. Moreover, he wanted Raymond to attend the convention
to prevent its control by the enemies of the Union party.</p>

<p>Raymond, still undecided, called with Seward upon the President, who
favoured neither a new party nor the restoration to power of the
Democratic party, although the movement, he said, ought not to repel
Democrats willing to act with it. He wanted the matter settled within
the Union party, and thought the proposed convention, in which
delegates from all the States could again meet in harmony, would exert
a wholesome influence on local conventions and nominations to
Congress.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Raymond, however, was still apprehensive. He deemed the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments &quot;reasonable, wise, and popular;&quot;
thought the President had &quot;made a great mistake in taking grounds
against them;&quot; and declared that notwithstanding the peppery method of
their passage &quot;the people will not be stopped by trifles.&quot; The outcome
of the convention also worried him. &quot;If it should happen to lay down a
platform,&quot; he continued, &quot;which shall command the respect of the
country, it would be such a miracle as we have no right to expect in
these days. However,&quot; he concluded, &quot;I shall be governed in my course
toward it by developments. I do not see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.144" id="Page_iii.144">iii. 144</a></span> necessity of denouncing
it from the start, nor until more is known of its composition,
purposes, and actions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Raymond did not attend the preliminary State convention held at
Saratoga on August 9. He left this work to Weed, who, with the help of
Dean Richmond, made an excellent showing in numbers and enthusiasm.
The support of the Democrats was assured because they would benefit,
and the presence of Tilden, Kernan, William H. Ludlow, and Sanford E.
Church created no surprise; but the interest manifested by John A.
Dix, Hamilton Fish, Moses Taylor, Marshall O. Roberts, Francis B.
Cutting, and Richard M. Blatchford amazed the Republicans. Henry J.
Raymond was made a delegate-at-large, with Samuel J. Tilden, John A.
Dix, and Sanford E. Church.</p>

<p>At Philadelphia the convention derived a manifest advantage from
having all the States, South as well as North, fully represented,
making it the first real &quot;National&quot; convention to assemble, it was
said, since 1860. Besides, it was a picturesque convention, full of
striking contrasts and unique spectacles. In the hotel lobbies Weed
and Richmond, walking together, seemed ubiquitous as they dominated
the management and arranged the details. Raymond and Church sat side
by side in the committee on resolutions, while the delegates from
Massachusetts and South Carolina, for spectacular effect, entered the
great wigwam arm in arm. This picture of apparent reconciliation
evoked the most enthusiastic cheers, and became the boast of the
Johnsonians until the wits likened the wigwam to Noah's Ark, into
which there went, &quot;two and two, of clean beasts, and of beasts that
are not clean, and of fowls, and of everything that creepeth upon the
earth.&quot;</p>

<p>John A. Dix became temporary chairman, and the resolutions, reciting
the issue between the President and the Republicans, laid great
emphasis upon the right of every State, without condition, to
representation in Congress as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.145" id="Page_iii.145">iii. 145</a></span> the war had ended. But Raymond,
presumably to please Southern delegates,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> pressed the argument far
beyond the scope of the resolutions, maintaining that even if the
condition of the Southern States rendered their admission unsafe
because still disloyal in sentiment and purpose, Congress had no power
to deny them rights conferred by the Constitution. This reckless claim
amazed his friends as much as it aroused his enemies, and he at once
became the object of most cutting reproaches. &quot;Had he been elected as
a Copperhead,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;no one could have complained that
he acted as a Copperhead, and had Judas been one of the Pharisees
instead of one of the Disciples, he would not be the worst example
that Presidents and Congressmen can follow.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Ten days later the
Republican National committee removed him from the chairmanship, a
punishment promptly followed by his removal from the committee.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
Raymond, in his talk with Seward, had anticipated trouble of this
character, but the humiliation was now doubly deep because it
separated him from friends whose staunch support had contributed to
his strength. Moreover, in a few weeks he was compelled to abandon the
President for reasons that had long existed. &quot;We have tried hard,&quot; he
wrote, &quot;to hold our original faith in his personal honesty, and to
attribute his disastrous action to errors of judgment and infirmities
of temper. The struggle has often been difficult, and we can maintain
it no longer.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> But the change came too late. He had followed too
far. It added to the sadness, also, because his popularity was never
to return to any considerable extent during the remaining three years
of his brilliant life.</p>

<p>Raymond's congressional experience, confined to a single term, added
nothing to his fame. He delivered clever speeches, his wide
intelligence and courteous manner won him popularity, and to some
extent he probably influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.146" id="Page_iii.146">iii. 146</a></span> public opinion; but his brief career
left no opportunity to live down his fatal alliance with Johnson.
Indeed, it may well be doubted if longer service or more favourable
conditions would have given him high standing as a legislator.
Prominence gained in one vocation is rarely transferred to another.
Legislation is a profession as much as medicine or law or journalism,
the practice of which, to gain leadership, must be long and
continuous, until proposed public measures and their treatment worked
out in the drudgery of the committee room, become as familiar as the
variety of questions submitted to lawyers and physicians. The
prolonged and exacting labour as a journalist which had given Raymond
his great reputation, must, in a measure, have been repeated as a
legislator to give him similar leadership in Congress. At forty-five
he was not too old to accomplish it. Samuel Shellabarger of Ohio, who
made his greatest speech in reply to Raymond, began his congressional
life at forty-nine, and Thaddeus Stevens, the leader of the House, at
fifty-seven. But the mental weariness, already apparent in Raymond's
face, indicated that the enthusiasm necessary for such preparation had
departed. Besides, he lacked the most important qualification for a
legislative leader&#8212;the rare political sagacity to know the thoughts
of people and to catch the tiniest shadow of a coming event.</p>

<p>Seward shared Raymond's unpopularity. Soon after assuming office
President Johnson outlined a severe policy toward the South, violently
denouncing traitors, who, he declared, must be punished and
impoverished. &quot;The time has arrived,&quot; he said, &quot;when the American
people should be educated that treason is the highest crime and those
engaged in it should suffer all its penalties.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> These sentiments,
reiterated again and again, extorted from Benjamin F. Wade, the chief
of Radicals, an entreaty that he would limit the number to be hung to
a good round dozen and no more.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Suddenly the President changed
his tone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.147" id="Page_iii.147">iii. 147</a></span> one of amnesty and reconciliation, and in answering the
question, &quot;who has influenced him?&quot; Sumner declared that &quot;Seward is
the marplot. He openly confesses that he counselled the present fatal
policy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Blaine also expressed the belief that the Secretary of
State changed the President's policy,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> a suggestion that Seward
himself corroborated in an after-dinner speech at New York in
September, 1866. &quot;When Mr. Johnson came into the Presidency,&quot; said the
Secretary, &quot;he did nothing until I got well, and then he sent for me
and we fixed things.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>But Seward did more to exasperate Republicans than change a harsh
policy to one of reconciliation. He believed in the soundness of the
President's constitutional views and the correctness of his vetoes,
deeming the course of Congress unwise.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> It is difficult,
therefore, to credit Blaine's unsupported statement that Seward
&quot;worked most earnestly to bring about an accommodation between the
Administration and Congress.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The split grew out of the
President's veto messages which Seward approved and probably wrote.</p>

<p>Until the spring of 1866 Seward's old friends believed he had remained
in the Cabinet to dispose of diplomatic questions which the war left
unsettled, but after his speech at Auburn on May 22 the men who once
regarded him as a champion of liberty and equality dropped him from
their list of saints. He argued that the country wanted reconciliation
instead of reconstruction, and denied that the President was
unfaithful to the party and its cardinal principles of public policy,
since his disagreements with Congress on the Freedman's Bureau and
Civil Rights Bills &quot;have no real bearing upon the question of
reconciliation.&quot; Nor was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.148" id="Page_iii.148">iii. 148</a></span> any &quot;soundness in our political
system, if the personal or civil rights of white or black, free born
or emancipated, are not more secure under the administration of a
State government than they could be under the administration of the
National government.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> This sentiment brought severe criticism.
&quot;Mr. Seward once earned honour by remembering the negro at a time when
others forgot him,&quot; said the <i>Independent</i>; &quot;he now earns dishonour by
forgetting the negro when the nation demands that the negro should be
remembered.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Seward's participation in the President's tour of the country
contributed to destroy his popularity. This Quixotic junketing journey
quickly passed into history as the &quot;swinging-around-the-circle&quot; trip,
which Lowell described as an &quot;advertising tour of a policy in want of
a party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Seward had many misgivings. The memory of the
President's condition on inauguration day and of his unfortunate
speech on February 22 did not augur well for its success. &quot;But it is a
duty to the President and to the country,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and I shall go
on with right good heart.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> In the East the party got on very
well, but at Cleveland and other Western cities the President acted
like a man both mad and drunk, while people railed at him as if he
were the clown of a circus. &quot;He sunk the Presidential office to the
level of a grog-house,&quot; wrote John Sherman.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Seward's position throughout was pathetic. His apologies and
commonplace appeals for his Chief contrasted strangely with the
courageous, powerful, and steady fight against the domination of
slavery which characterised his former visits to Cleveland, and the
men who had accepted him as their ardent champion deprecated both his
acts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.149" id="Page_iii.149">iii. 149</a></span> his words. It called to mind Fillmore's desertion of his
anti-slavery professions, and Van Buren's revengeful action in 1848.
&quot;Distrusted by his old friends,&quot; said the <i>Nation</i>, &quot;he will never be
taken to the bosom of his old enemies. His trouble is not that the
party to which he once belonged is without a leader, but that he
wanders about like a ghost&#8212;a leader without a party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> knowledge that Republicans, to overcome the President's vetoes,
must have a two-thirds majority in Congress, precipitated a State
campaign of unusual energy. The contest which began on April 9, when
Johnson disapproved the Civil Rights Bill, was intensified by the
Philadelphia convention and the President's &quot;swing-around-the-circle;&quot;
but the events that made men bitter and deeply in earnest were the
Memphis and New Orleans riots, in which one hundred and eighty negroes
were killed and only eleven of their assailants injured. To the North
this became an object-lesson, illustrating the insincerity of the
South's desire, expressed at Philadelphia, for reconciliation and
peace.</p>

<p>The Republican State convention, meeting at Syracuse on September 5,
echoed this sentiment. In the centre of the stage the Stars and
Stripes, gracefully festooned, formed a halo over the portrait of
Abraham Lincoln, while a Nast caricature of President Johnson betrayed
the contempt of the enthusiastic gathering. Weed and Raymond were
conspicuous by their absence. The Radicals made Charles H. Van Wyck
chairman, Lyman Tremaine president, George William Curtis chairman of
the committee on resolutions, and Horace Greeley the lion of the
convention. At the latter's appearance delegates leaped to their feet
and gave three rounds of vociferous cheers. The day's greatest
demonstration, however, occurred when the chairman, in his opening
speech, stigmatised the New York friends of the President.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Van
Wyck prudently censored his bitterness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.151" id="Page_iii.151">iii. 151</a></span> from the press copy, but the
episode reflected the intense unpopularity of Seward, Weed, and
Raymond.</p>

<p>In the privacy of the club Seward's old-time champions had spoken of
&quot;the decline of his abilities,&quot; &quot;the loss of his wits,&quot; and &quot;that
dry-rot of the mind's noble temper;&quot; but now, in a crowded public
hall, they cheered any sentiment that charged a betrayal of trust and
the loss of principles. Of course Seward had not lost his principles,
nor betrayed his trust. He held the opinions then that he entertained
before the removal of the splints and bandages from the wounds
inflicted by the bowie-knife of the would-be assassin. He had been in
thorough accord with Lincoln's amnesty proclamation, issued in
December, 1863, as well as with his &quot;Louisiana plan&quot; of
reconstruction, and Johnson's proclamation and plan of reconstruction,
written under Seward's influence, did not differ materially. But
Seward's principles which rarely harmonised with those of the
Radicals, now became more conspicuous and sharply defined because of
the tactlessness and uncompromising spirit of Lincoln's successor.
Besides, he was held responsible for the President's follies. To a
convention filled with crutches, scarred faces, armless sleeves, and
representatives of Andersonville and Libby Prisons, such an attitude
seemed like a betrayal of his trust, and the resentment of the
delegates, perhaps, was not unnatural.</p>

<p>If Seward was discredited, Reuben E. Fenton was conspicuously trusted.
According to Andrew D. White, a prominent State senator of that day,
the Governor was not a star of the magnitude of his Republican
predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Others probably held the same opinion. Fenton's
party, however, renominated him by acclamation, and then showed its
inconsistency by refusing a like honour to Thomas G. Alvord, the
lieutenant-governor. The service of the Onondaga Chief, as his friends
delighted to call him, had been as creditable if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.152" id="Page_iii.152">iii. 152</a></span> not as important as
the Governor's, but the brilliant gifts of Stewart L. Woodford, a
young soldier of patriotic impulses, attracted a large majority of the
convention.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Up to that time, Woodford, then thirty years of age,
was the youngest man nominated for lieutenant-governor. He had made a
conspicuous sacrifice to become a soldier. In 1861 Lincoln appointed
him an assistant United States attorney, but the silenced guns of
Sumter inspired him to raise a company, and he marched away at its
head, leaving the civil office to another. Later he became commandant
of the city that sheltered the guns first trained upon the American
flag, and after his return, disciplined and saddened by scenes of
courage and sacrifice, the clarion notes of the young orator easily
commanded the emotions of his hearers. No one ever wearied when he
spoke. His lightest word, sent thrilling to the rim of a vast
audience, swayed it with the magic of control. He was not then at the
fulness of his power or reputation, but delegates had heard enough to
desire his presence in the important campaign of 1866, and to
stimulate his activity they made him a candidate.</p>

<p>The platform declared that while the constitutional authority of the
Federal government cannot be impaired by the act of a State or its
people, a State may, by rebellion, so far rupture its relations to the
Union as to suspend its power to exercise the rights which it
possessed under the Constitution; that it belonged to the legislative
power of the government to determine at what time a State may safely
resume the exercise of its rights; and that the doctrine that such
State is itself to judge when it is in proper condition to resume its
place in the Union is false, as well as the other doctrine that the
President was alone sole judge of the period when such suspension
shall be at an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.153" id="Page_iii.153">iii. 153</a></span></p>

<p>If these propositions created no surprise, the refusal squarely to
meet the suffrage issue created much adverse comment. One resolution
expressed a hope that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment would
tend to the equalisation of all political rights among citizens of the
Union, but although Greeley submitted a suffrage plank, as he did in
the preceding year, Curtis carefully avoided an expression favourable
even to the colored troops.</p>

<p>&quot;Extreme opinions usually derive a certain amount of strength from
logical consistency,&quot; wrote Raymond. &quot;Between the antecedent
proposition of an argument and its practical conclusion there is
ordinarily a connection which commends itself to the advocates of
principle. But the radicalism which proposes to reconstruct the Union
has not this recommendation. Its principles and its policy are not
more alike than fire and water. What it contends for theoretically it
surrenders practically.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Although this was clearly a just
criticism, the radicalism of Congress showed more leniency in practice
than in theory. The Northern people themselves were not yet ready for
negro suffrage, and had the South promptly accepted the Fourteenth
Amendment and the congressional plan of reconstruction, it is doubtful
if the Fifteenth Amendment would have been heard of.</p>

<p>Conservative Republicans, however, were too well satisfied with their
work at Philadelphia to appreciate this tendency of Congress. The
evidence of reconciliation had been spectacular, if not sincere, and
they believed public opinion was with them. The country, it was
argued, required peace; the people have made up their minds to have
peace; and to insure peace the Southern States must enjoy their
constitutional right to seats in Congress. &quot;This is the one question
now before the country,&quot; said the <i>Post</i>; &quot;and all men of every party
who desire the good of the country and can see what is immediately
necessary to produce this good, will unite to send to Congress only
men who will vote for the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.154" id="Page_iii.154">iii. 154</a></span>mediate admission of Southern
representatives.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> In the opinion of such journals the situation
presented a rare opportunity to the Democratic party. By becoming the
vehicle to bring real peace and good will to the country, it would not
only efface its questionable war record, but it could &quot;spike the guns&quot;
of the Radicals, control Congress, sustain the President, and carry
the Empire State. This was the hope of Raymond and of Weed, back of
whom, it was said, stood tens of thousands of Republicans.</p>

<p>To aid in the accomplishment of this work, great reliance had been
placed upon the tour of the President. Raymond reluctantly admitted
that these anticipations were far from realised,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> although the
managers thought the tour through New York, where the President had
been fairly discreet, was of value in marshalling the sentiment of
Republicans. Besides, it seemed to them to show, in rural districts
and towns as well as in the commercial centres, a decided preference
for a policy aimed to effect the union of all the States according to
the Constitution.</p>

<p>To encourage the co&#246;peration of Republicans, the Democrats, led by
Dean Richmond, agreed, temporarily at least, to merge their name and
organisation in that of the National Union party. This arrangement was
not easily accomplished. The <i>World</i> hesitated and the <i>Leader</i>
ridiculed, but when the Democracy of the State approved, these
journals acquiesced.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> In obedience to this understanding the
Democratic State committee called a National Union State convention,
and invited all to participate who favoured the principles enunciated
by the Philadelphia convention. The obscuration of State policies and
partisan prejudices made this broad and patriotic overture, devoted
exclusively to a more perfect peace, sound as soft and winning as the
spider's invitation to the fly. &quot;If the action of the convention is in
harmony with the spirit of the call,&quot; wrote Ray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.155" id="Page_iii.155">iii. 155</a></span>mond, &quot;it cannot fail
to command a large degree of popular support.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> As county
delegations equally divided between Republicans and Democrats arrived
at Albany on September 11, it was apparent that the invitation had
been accepted at its face value. Although no Republican of prominence
appeared save Thurlow Weed, many Republicans of repute in their
respective localities answered to the roll call. These men favoured
John A. Dix for governor. To them he stood distinctly for the specific
policy announced at Philadelphia. In his opening address at that
convention he had sounded the key-note, declaring a speedy restoration
of the Union by the admission of Southern representatives to Congress
a necessary condition of safe political and party action. Besides, Dix
had been a Democrat all his life, a devoted supporter of the
government during the war, and it was believed his career would
command the largest measure of public confidence in the present
emergency.</p>

<p>This had been the opinion of Dean Richmond, whose death on August 27
deprived the convention of his distinguished leadership. This was also
the view of Edwards Pierrepont, then as afterward a powerful factor in
whatever circle he entered. Although a staunch Democrat, Pierrepont
had announced, at the historic meeting in Union Square on April 20,
1861, an unqualified devotion to the government, and had accepted,
with James T. Brady and Hamilton Fish, a place on the union defence
committee. Later, he served on a commission with Dix to try prisoners
of state, and in 1864 advocated the election of Lincoln. There was no
dough about Pierrepont. He had shown himself an embodied influence,
speaking with force, and usually with success. He possessed the grit
and the breadth of his ancestors, one of whom was a chief founder of
Yale College, and his presence in the State convention, although he
had not been at Philadelphia, encouraged the hope that it would
concentrate the conservative sentiment and strength of New York, and
restore Democracy to popular confidence. Stimulated by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.156" id="Page_iii.156">iii. 156</a></span>
earnestness, the up-State delegates, when the convention opened, had
practically settled Dix's nomination.</p>

<p>There were other candidates. A few preferred Robert H. Pruyn of
Albany, a Republican of practical energy and large political
experience, and until lately minister to Italy, while others thought
well of Henry C. Murphy of Brooklyn, a Democrat and State senator of
recognised ability. But next to Dix the favourite was John T. Hoffman,
then mayor of New York. It had been many years since the Democrats of
the metropolis had had a State executive. Edwards Pierrepont said that
&quot;no man in the convention was born when the last Democratic governor
was elected from New York or Brooklyn.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> This, of course, was
hyperbole, since Pierrepont himself could remember when, at the
opening of the Erie Canal, Governor DeWitt Clinton, amidst the roar of
artillery and the eloquence of many orators, passed through the locks
at Albany, uniting the waters of Lake Erie with those of the Hudson.
Perhaps the thought of Clinton, climbing from the mayoralty to the
more distinguished office of governor, added to the desire of Hoffman,
for although the latter's capacity was limited in comparison with the
astonishing versatility and mental activity of Clinton, he was not
without marked ability.</p>

<p>Hoffman's life had been full of sunshine and success. He was a
distinguished student at Union College, an excellent lawyer, an
effective speaker, and a superb gentleman. Slenderly but strongly
built, his square, firm chin and prominent features, relieved by large
brown eyes, quickly attracted attention as he appeared in public. &quot;In
the winter of 1866,&quot; wrote Rhodes, &quot;I used frequently to see him at an
early morning hour walking down Broadway on his way to the City Hall.
Tall and erect, under forty and in full mental and physical vigor, he
presented a distinguished appearance and was looked at with interest
as he passed with long elastic strides. He was regarded as one of the
coming men of the nation. He had the air of a very successful man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.157" id="Page_iii.157">iii. 157</a></span>
is well satisfied with himself and confident that affairs in general
are working for his advantage.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Not always overstocked with eligibles whom it could admire and trust,
Tammany, proud of the young man's accomplishments, elected him in
1860, at the age of thirty-two, recorder of the city, the presiding
officer of what was then the principal criminal court. Here he
acquitted himself, especially in the draft riot of 1863, with such
credit that Republicans and Democrats united in re-electing him, and
in 1865, before the expiration of his second term as recorder, Tammany
made him mayor. It was a hard, close contest. Indeed, success could
not have come to Tammany without the aid of Hoffman's increasing
popularity. This office, however, plunged him at once into partisan
politics, and gave to his career an uncertain character, as if a turn
of chance would decide what path of political life he was next to
follow. Now, at the age of thirty-eight, Tammany proposed making him
governor.</p>

<p>But Hoffman represented neither the principles nor the purposes of the
Philadelphia convention. The success of that movement depended largely
upon the pre-eminent fitness of the men who led it. The question was,
would the State be safer in the hands of a well-known Democratic
statesman like Dix than in the control of Fenton and the Radicals? Dix
stood for everything honest and conservative. For more than three
decades his prudence had been indissolubly associated with the wise
discretion of William L. Marcy and Silas Wright, while Hoffman, the
exponent of unpurged Democracy, charged with promoting its welfare and
success, was the one man whom conservative Republicans wished to
avoid, and whom, in their forcible presentation of Dix, they were
driving out of the race.</p>

<p>Democratic leaders saw the situation with alarm. They had endorsed the
Philadelphia movement to get into power,&#8212;not to give it to Dix and
the Conservatives. The Presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.158" id="Page_iii.158">iii. 158</a></span>dent's reconstruction policy, benefiting
their party in the South and thus strengthening it in national
elections, had been adopted with sincerity, but they did not seriously
propose to merge their organisation in the State with another, giving
it the reins and the whip. &quot;The New York delegation to Philadelphia,&quot;
said the <i>World</i>, &quot;was appointed by a gathering of politicians at
Saratoga, who neither represented, had any authority to bind, nor made
any pretence of binding the Democratic organisation of the
State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Indeed, it was treated as a surprising revelation that
conservative Republicans and Dix Democrats should come to Albany with
such a notion. However, the Dix appeal, developing wonderful strength,
could not be reasoned with, and in their desperation the Democrats
sought an adjournment until the morrow. This the convention refused,
granting only a recess until four o'clock. In the meantime Dix's
chances strengthened. It was plain that his nomination, on lines
approved by Seward, meant a split in Republican ranks, and the
up-State delegates, fearing delay, stood for early action. Then came
the inevitable trick. On reassembling a motion to adjourn was voted
down three to one, but Sanford E. Church, the chairman, declaring it
carried, put on his hat and quickly left the hall. It was an audacious
proceeding. Two-thirds of the convention stood aghast, and Church, the
next morning, found it necessary to make an abject apology.
Nevertheless, his purpose had been accomplished. Adjournment gave
Tammany the time fiercely to assail Dix, who was now charged with
consigning Democrats to Fort Lafayette, suppressing Democratic
legislatures, and opposing Seymour in 1864. John Morrissey, the
pugilist and congressman, declared that Dix could not poll twenty
thousand votes in New York City. Meanwhile Democratic leaders, closing
the door against Weed and the Conservatives, quietly agreed upon
Hoffman. Had Dean Richmond lived a month longer this <i>coup d'&#233;tat</i>
would probably not have occurred. In vigour of intellect, in terseness
of expression, and in grasp of ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.159" id="Page_iii.159">iii. 159</a></span>tions presented for consideration,
Richmond was recognised as the first unofficial man in America, and he
had long thought it time for the Democratic party to get into step
with the progress of events.</p>

<p>The next morning, as prearranged, Edwards Pierrepont took the floor,
and after characterising the assembly as a Democratic convention whose
programme had been settled in advance by Democrats, he formally and
apparently with the assent of Dix coolly withdrew the latter's name,
moving that the nomination of John T. Hoffman be made by
acclamation.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This was carried with shouts of wild exultation.
Many Dix supporters, anticipating the outcome, had silently left the
hall, but enough remained to hear, with profound astonishment, the
confession of Pierrepont that he had united with Tammany for the
nomination of Hoffman before the meeting of the Philadelphia
convention. Why, then, it was asked, did he advocate Dix the day
before? and upon whose authority did he withdraw Dix's name? After
such an exposure it could not be said of Pierrepont that he was
without guile. &quot;It was the occasion of especial surprise and regret,&quot;
wrote Weed, &quot;that even before the National Union State convention had
concluded its labours, Judge Pierrepont should have assumed that it
was a Democratic convention, and that its programme had been settled
in advance by Democrats. This was not less a surprise when I
remembered that on the day previous to that announcement, Judge
Pierrepont concurred fully with me in the opinion that the nomination
of General Dix for governor was expedient and desirable.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>But the worst blow to a union of political interests was yet to come.
To afford the people safety in their persons, security in their
property, and honesty in the administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.160" id="Page_iii.160">iii. 160</a></span> of their government, a
Republican Legislature had placed the affairs of New York City largely
in control of Boards and Commissions. Tammany naturally resented this
invasion of home rule, and after reaffirming the principles of the
Philadelphia movement, the convention declared that &quot;recent
legislation at Albany has usurped a supreme yet fitful control of the
local affairs which counties and municipalities are entitled to
regulate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> To Conservatives nothing could have been more
offensive than such a declaration. &quot;There are thousands of
Republicans,&quot; said Raymond, &quot;who long for a restoration of the Union
by the admission to their seats in Congress of loyal men from loyal
States, but who will be quite likely to prefer taking their chances of
securing this result from the action of the Republican party, modified
as it may be by reflection and moderate counsels, rather than seek it
in the way marked out for them by the Albany Democratic
convention.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Thus the clash began. Conservatives resented the evident intention of
the Democrats to strengthen their party at the expense of the
Philadelphia movement. &quot;We desire to call special attention,&quot; said a
Buffalo paper, &quot;to the necessity of carrying out in good faith the
understanding which was entered into at the Philadelphia convention
that all old party antecedents and future action should be merged in
the National Union organisation. It was not contemplated then, or
since, to strengthen the Democratic party by that movement, and any
effort in that direction now cannot fail to be mischievous.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Before the month of September expired Raymond warned the <i>World</i> that
he was not pledged to the action of the Albany convention. &quot;No
Republican went into it for any such purpose,&quot; he said. &quot;No hint of
putting it to any such use was given in the call or in any of its
preliminary proceedings. The convention was called to give effect to
the principles and policy of the Philadelphia convention, and
Republicans who approved those principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.161" id="Page_iii.161">iii. 161</a></span> concurred in the call. But
how did this give that convention the right to commit them in favour
of measures alien from its ostensible purpose, and at war with their
entire political action? It is utterly preposterous to suppose that
they can co&#246;perate with the Democratic party in the accomplishment of
any such design.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Five days later Raymond announced his support of the Republican
ticket.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> It was significant of his sincerity that he declined to
run again for Congress. Thomas E. Stewart, a conservative Republican,
was easily elected in the Sixth District, and Raymond could have had
the same vote, but without &quot;the approval of those who originally gave
me their suffrage,&quot; he said, &quot;a seat in Congress ceases to have any
attraction. With the Democratic party, as it has been organised and
directed since the rebellion broke out, I have nothing in
common.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> It is impossible not to feel a high respect for the
manner in which Raymond, having come to this determination, at once
acted upon it. He resented no criticism; he allowed no gleam of
feeling to creep into his editorials. Few men could have avoided the
temptation to assume the tone of the wronged one who endures much and
will not complain. Instinctively, however, Raymond felt the bad taste
and unwisdom of such a style, and he joined heartily and
good-naturedly in the effort to elect Reuben E. Fenton.</p>

<p>Thurlow Weed, on the other hand, remained a Conservative. Indeed, he
went a step farther in the way of irreconciliation, preferring Hoffman
and Tammany, he said, to &quot;the reckless, red-radicalism which rules the
present Congress.... The men who now lead the radical crusade against
the President,&quot; he continued, explanatory of his course, &quot;attempted
during the war to divide the North. That calamity was averted by the
firmness and patriotism of conservative Republicans. In 1864 the same
leaders, as hostile to Mr. Lincoln as they are to President Johnson,
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.162" id="Page_iii.162">iii. 162</a></span>tempted to defeat his election by a flank movement at Cleveland.
Mr. Greeley wrote private letters to prominent Republicans inviting
their co&#246;peration in a scheme to defeat Mr. Lincoln's election. The
same leaders went to Washington last December with the deliberate
intention to quarrel with the President, who up to that day and hour
had followed in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor. Their
denunciations have been systematic and fiendish. If, under a keen
sense of injustice, he has since erred in judgment or temper, none
will deny the sufficiency of the provocation. That it would have been
wiser, though less manly, to forbear, I admit. But no nature, merely
human, excepting, perhaps, that of Abraham Lincoln, can patiently
endure wanton public indignities and contumely.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>After the October elections it became apparent that the North would
support Congress rather than the President. One cause of distrust was
the latter's replacement of Republican office-holders with men noted
for disloyalty during the war. Weed complained that the appointment of
an obnoxious postmaster in Brooklyn &quot;has cost us thousands of votes in
that city.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> During the campaign Johnson removed twelve hundred
and eighty-three postmasters, and relatively as many custom-house
employ&#233;s and internal revenue officers.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Among the latter was
Philip Dorsheimer of Buffalo. Indeed, the sweep equalled the violent
action of the Council of Appointment in the days when DeWitt Clinton
and Ambrose Spencer, resenting opposition to Morgan Lewis, sent Peter
B. Porter to the political guillotine for supporting Aaron Burr. Such
wholesale removals, however, did not arrest the progress of the
Republican party. After Johnson's &quot;swing around the circle,&quot;
Conservatives were reduced to a few prominent men who could not
consistently retrace their steps, and to hungry office-holders who
were known as &quot;the bread and butter brigade.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.163" id="Page_iii.163">iii. 163</a></span> <i>Post</i>, a
loyal advocate of the President's policy, thought it a melancholy
reflection &quot;That its most damaging opponent is the President, who
makes a judicious course so hateful to the people that no argument is
listened to, and no appeals to reason, to the Constitution, to common
sense, can gain a hearing.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Henry Ward Beecher voiced a similar
lament. The great divine had suffered severe criticism for casting his
large influence on the side of Johnson, and he now saw success melting
away because of the President's vicious course. &quot;Mr. Johnson just now
and for some time past,&quot; he wrote, &quot;has been the greatest obstacle in
the way of his own views. The mere fact that he holds them is their
condemnation with a public utterly exasperated with his rudeness and
violence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> A few weeks later the Brooklyn minister, tired of the
insincerity of the President and of his Philadelphia movement, opened
the campaign with a characteristic speech in support of the Republican
candidates.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>In animation, frequent meetings, and depth of interest, the campaign
resembled a Presidential contest. The issues were largely national. As
one of the disastrous results of Johnson's reconstruction policy,
Republicans pointed to the New Orleans and Memphis massacres,
intensified by the charge of the Southern loyalists that &quot;more than a
thousand devoted Union citizens have been murdered in cold blood since
the surrender of Lee.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The horrors of Andersonville, illuminated
by eye witnesses, and the delay to try Jefferson Davis, added to the
exasperation. On the other hand, Democrats traced Southern conditions
to opposition to the President's policy, charging Congress with a base
betrayal of the Constitution in requiring the late Confederate States
to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment as a condition precedent to the
admission of their representatives. The great debate attracted to the
rostrum the ablest and best known speakers. For the Republicans,
Roscoe Conkling, sounding the ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.164" id="Page_iii.164">iii. 164</a></span>cepted key-note, now for the first
time made an extended tour of the State, speaking in fourteen towns
and cities. On the other hand, true to the traditions of his life,
John A. Dix threw his influence on the side of the President.</p>

<p>Hoffman, also, patiently traversed the State, discussing
constitutional and legal principles with the care of an able lawyer.
There was much in Hoffman himself to attract the enthusiasm of popular
assemblages. Kind and sympathetic, with a firm dignity that avoided
undue familiarity, he was irresistibly fascinating to men as he moved
among them. He had an attractive presence, a genial manner, and a good
name. He had, too, a peculiar capacity for understanding and pleasing
people, being liberal and spontaneous in his expressions of sympathy,
and apparently earnest in his attachment to principle. He was not an
orator. He lacked dash, brilliant rhetoric, and attractive figures of
speech. He rarely stirred the emotions. But he pleased people. They
felt themselves in the presence of one whom they could trust as well
as admire. The Democratic party wanted a new hero, and the favourite
young mayor seemed cut out to supply the want.</p>

<p>However, Hoffman did not escape the barbed criticism of the Republican
press. Raymond had spoken of his ability and purity, and of his course
during the war as patriotic.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Weed, also, had said that &quot;during
the rebellion he was loyal to the government and Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> To
overcome these certificates of character, the <i>Tribune</i> declared that
&quot;Saturn is not more hopelessly bound with rings than he. Rings of
councilmen, rings of aldermen, rings of railroad corporations, hold
him in their charmed circles, and would, if he were elected, use his
influence to plunder the treasury and the people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> It also
charged him with being disloyal. In 1866 and for several years later
the standing of pronounced Copperheads was similar to that of Tories
after the Revolution, and it seriously crippled a candidate for office
to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.165" id="Page_iii.165">iii. 165</a></span> classed among them. Moreover, it was easy to discredit a
Democrat's loyalty. To most members of the Union party the name itself
clothed a man with suspicion, and the slightest specification, like
the outcropping of a ledge of rocks, indicated that much more was
concealed than had been shown. On this theory, the Republican press,
deeming it desirable, if not absolutely essential, to put Hoffman into
the disloyal class, accepted the memory of men who heard him speak at
Sing Sing, his native town, in 1864. As they remembered, he had
declared that &quot;Democrats only had gone to war;&quot; that &quot;volunteering
stopped when Lincoln declared for an abolition policy;&quot; and that he
&quot;would advise revolution and resistance to the government&quot; if Lincoln
was elected without Tennessee being represented in the electoral
college.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Other men told how &quot;at one of the darkest periods of the
war, Hoffman urged an immediate sale of United States securities, then
under his control and held by the sinking fund of the city.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In
the <i>Tribune's</i> opinion such convenient recollections of unnamed and
unknown men made him a &quot;Copperhead.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Although New York indicated the same direction of the popular will
that had manifested itself in Pennsylvania and other October States,
the heavy and fraudulent registration in New York City encouraged the
belief that Tammany would overcome the up-State vote.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> However,
the pronounced antagonism to the President proved too serious a
handicap, and the Radicals, electing Fenton by 13,000 majority,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
carried both branches of the Legislature, and twenty out of thirty-one
congressmen. It was regarded a great victory for Fenton, who was
really opposed by one of the most formidable combinations known to the
politics of the State. Besides the full strength of the Democratic
party, the combined liquor interest antagonised him, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.166" id="Page_iii.166">iii. 166</a></span> Weed
forces, backed by the Johnsonised federal officials, were not less
potent. Indeed, Seward publicly predicted Republican defeat by 40,000
majority.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>The result also insured the election of a Republican to the United
States Senate to succeed Ira Harris on March 4, 1867. Candidates for
the high honour were numerous. Before the end of November Horace
Greeley, having suffered defeat for Congress in the Fourth District,
served notice of his desire.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> George William Curtis had a like
ambition. Lyman Tremaine, too, was willing. Charles J. Folger, the
strong man of the State Senate, belonged in the same class, and Ransom
Balcom of Binghamton, who had achieved an enviable reputation as a
Supreme Court judge, also had his friends. But the three men seriously
talked of were Ira Harris, Noah Davis, and Roscoe Conkling.</p>

<p>Harris had been something of a disappointment. He had performed the
duties of judge and legislator with marked ability, but in Washington,
instead of exercising an adequate influence on the floor of the
Senate, he contented himself with voting, performing committee work,
and attending to the personal wants of soldiers and other
constituents. President Lincoln, referring to the Senator's
persistency in pressing candidates for office, once said: &quot;I never
think of going to sleep now without first looking under my bed to see
if Judge Harris is not there wanting something for somebody.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Davis had been on the Supreme bench since 1857, and although he had
had little opportunity to develop statesmanship, his enthusiastic
devotion to the Union had discovered resources of argument and a
fearless independence which were destined to win him great fame in the
trial of William M. Tweed. People liked his nerve, believed in his
honesty, confided in his judgment, and revelled in the retorts that
leaped to his lips. There was no question, either, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.167" id="Page_iii.167">iii. 167</a></span> he would stand
if called to vote upon the impeachment of the President, a proceeding
already outlined and practically determined upon by the majority in
Congress. This could not be said with confidence of Ira Harris.
Although his radicalism had stiffened as the time for a re-election
approached, he had not always been terribly in earnest. It was not his
nature to jump to the support of a measure that happened to please the
fancy of the moment. Yet his votes followed those of Senator
Fessenden, and his voice, if not strong in debate, expressed the
wisdom and judgment of a safe counsellor.</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives Conkling had displayed real ability.
Time had vindicated his reasons for demanding a bankrupt law, and his
voice, raised for economy in the public expense, had made him of
special service during the war. He voted to reduce the mileage of
congressmen, he opposed the creation of wide-open commissions, and he
aided in uncovering frauds in the recruiting service. In the darkest
hour of rebellion he approved Vallandigham's arrest and refused to
join a movement to displace Lincoln for another candidate. On his
return to Congress, after his defeat in 1862, he had passed to the
Committee on Ways and Means, and to the Joint Committee on
Reconstruction. Of the Radicals no one surpassed him in diligence and
energy. He voted to confiscate the property of rebels, he stood with
Stevens for disfranchising all persons who voluntarily adhered to the
late insurrection until July 4, 1870, and he would agree to no plan
that operated to disfranchise the coloured population. Indeed, to the
system of constructive legislation which represented the plan of
reconstruction devised by Congress, he practically devoted his time.</p>

<p>Of the New York delegation Conkling was admittedly the ablest speaker,
although in a House which numbered among its members James A.
Garfield, Thaddeus Stevens, and James G. Blaine, he was not an
admitted star of the first magnitude. Blaine's serious oratorical
castigation, administered after a display of offensive manners, had
disarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.168" id="Page_iii.168">iii. 168</a></span> him except in resentment.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The <i>Times</i> spoke of him as
of &quot;secondary rank,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and the <i>Tribune</i>, the great organ of the
party, had declined to put upon him the seal of its approval. Besides,
his vanity and arrogance, although not yet a fruitful subject of the
comic literature of the day, disparaged almost as much as his
brilliant rhetoric exalted him. Careful observers, however, had not
failed to measure Conkling's ability. From Paris, William Cullen
Bryant wrote his friends to make every effort to nominate him, and
Parke Godwin extended the same quality of support.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> His recent
campaign, too, had made men proud of him. Although disaffected
Republicans sought to drive him from public life, and the <i>Tribune</i>
had withheld its encouragement, he gained a great triumph.</p>

<p>But men talked geography. Seward and Preston King had represented
western New York, and since Morgan had succeeded King, a western man,
it was argued, should suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.169" id="Page_iii.169">iii. 169</a></span>ceed Harris. This strengthened Noah Davis.
Never in the history of the State, declared his friends, had a United
States senator been taken from territory west of Cayuga Bridge, a
section having over one million people, and giving in the recent
election 27,000 Republican majority. On this and the strength of their
candidate the western counties relied, with the further hope of
inheriting Harris' strength whenever it left him. On the other hand,
Harris sought support as the second choice of the Davis men. Greeley
never really got into the race. Organisation would probably not have
availed him, but after serving notice upon his friends that their
ardent and button-holing support would not be sanctioned by him, the
impression obtained that Greeley was as ridiculous as his letter.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
When Lyman Tremaine withdrew from the contest he threw his influence
to Conkling. This jolted Harris. Then Andrew D. White changed from
Curtis to the Oneidan. Curtis understood the situation too well to
become active. &quot;The only chance,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is a bitter deadlock
between the three, or two, chiefs. The friends of Davis proposed to me
to make a combination against Conkling, the terms being the election
of whichever was stronger now,&#8212;Davis or me,&#8212;and the pledges of the
successful man to support the other two years hence. I declined
absolutely.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> As Harris weakened, Reuben E. Fenton, hopeful of
becoming Edwin D. Morgan's successor in 1869, restrained any rush to
Davis.</p>

<p>The potential influence of Ellis H. Roberts, editor of the Utica
<i>Herald</i>, a paper of large circulation in northern and central New
York, proved of great assistance to Conkling. Roberts was of Welsh
origin, a scholar in politics, strong with the pen, and conspicuously
prominent in the discussion of economic issues. When in Congress
(1871-75) he served upon the Ways and Means Committee. In 1867 his
friends sent him to the Assembly especially to promote the election of
Utica's favourite son, and in his sincere, earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.170" id="Page_iii.170">iii. 170</a></span> efforts he very
nearly consolidated the Republican press of the State in Conkling's
behalf. During the week's fierce contest at Albany he marshalled his
forces with rare skill, not forgetting that vigilance brings
victory.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>Thus the strife, without bitterness because free from factional
strife, remained for several days at white-heat. &quot;On reaching here
Tuesday night,&quot; Conkling wrote his wife, &quot;the crowd took and held
possession of me till about three o'clock the next morning. Hundreds
came and went, and until Thursday night this continued from early
morning to early morning again. The contest is a very curious and
complex one. Great sums of money are among the influences here. I have
resolutely put down my foot that no friend of mine, even without my
knowledge, shall pay a cent, upon any pretext nor in any strait, come
what will. If chosen, it will be by the men of character, and if
beaten this will be my consolation. The gamblers say that I can have
$200,000 here from New York in a moment if I choose, and that the
members are fools to elect me without it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> As evidence of the
want of faith in legislative virtue, the <i>Times</i> gave the answer of a
veteran lobbyist, who was asked respecting the chances of Freeman
Clarke. &quot;Who's Clark?&quot; he inquired. &quot;Formerly the comptroller of the
currency,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the lobbyist; &quot;and if he
controlled the currency now, he would have a sure thing of it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Conkling's winning card was his forensic ability. In the United State
Senate, since the days of Seward, New York had been weak in debating
power, and the party's desire to be represented by one who could place
the Empire State in the front rank of influence appealed strongly to
many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.171" id="Page_iii.171">iii. 171</a></span> legislators. Andrew D. White, therefore, raised a
whirlwind of applause at the caucus when he declared, in seconding
Conkling's nomination, that what the Empire State wanted was not
judicial talent &quot;but a voice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, so evenly did the members divide that it took five
ballots to make a nomination. Conkling led on the first ballot and
Davis on the second. On the third, Conkling stood one ahead, and three
on the fourth, with Harris clinging to six votes. The disposition of
these six would make a senator, and by gaining them Conkling became
the nominee on the fifth ballot.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Had they gone to Noah Davis,
Fenton's way to the Senate in 1869 must have been blocked. But the
Governor was watchful. At the critical moment on the last ballot, one
vote which had been twice thrown for Davis went back to Folger. The
Chautauquan did not propose to take any chances.</p>

<h2>THE RISE OF TWEEDISM</h2>

<h2>1867</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> election of Roscoe Conkling to the United States Senate made him
the most prominent, if not the most influential politician in New
York. &quot;No new senator,&quot; said a Washington paper, &quot;has ever made in so
short a time such rapid strides to a commanding position in that
body.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Conkling was not yet established, however. His friends who wished to
make him chairman of the Republican State convention which assembled
at Syracuse on September 24, 1867, discovered that he was not beloved
by the Radical leaders. He had a habit of speaking his own mind, and
instead of confining his thoughts to the committee room, or whispering
them in the ears of a few alleged leaders, it was his custom to take
the public into his confidence. Horace Greeley, jealous of his
prerogative, disapproved such independence, and Governor Fenton, the
<i>Tribune's</i> prot&#233;g&#233;, had apprehensions for his own leadership.
Besides, it was becoming more apparent each day that the men who did
not like Greeley and preferred other leadership to Fenton's, thought
well of Conkling. He was not a wild partisan. Although a stiff Radical
he had no reason to feel bitter toward men who happened to differ with
him on governmental policies. His life did not run back into the
quarrels between Greeley and Thurlow Weed, and he had no disposition
to be tangled up with them; but when he discovered that Greeley had
little use for him, he easily formed friendships among men who had
little use for Greeley. It was noticeable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.173" id="Page_iii.173">iii. 173</a></span> Conkling did not
criticise Raymond's erratic run after Andrew Johnson. He heard
Shellabarger's stinging reply, he listened to the editor's hopeless
appeal for support, and he voted against the resolution of confidence
in the President, but he added nothing to Raymond's humiliation.
Perhaps this accounted for the latter's appreciation of the young
Senator. At all events, the <i>Times</i> complimented while the <i>Tribune</i>
remained silent. It was evident the great Republican organ did not
intend advertising the ability of the strenuous, self-asserting
Senator, who was rapidly becoming a leader.</p>

<p>The existence of this jealousy quickly betrayed itself to Conkling's
admirers at the State convention. On the surface men were calm and
responsive. But in forming the committee on permanent organisation
Fenton's supporters, who easily controlled the convention, secretly
arranged to make Lyman Tremaine chairman. When this plan came to the
ears of the Conkling men, one of them, with the shrewdness of a
genuine politician, surprised the schemers by moving to instruct the
committee to report the Senator for permanent president. This made it
necessary to accept or squarely to reject him, and wishing to avoid
open opposition, the Governor's managers allowed the convention to
acquiesce in the motion amid the vociferous cheers of the Senator's
friends.</p>

<p>Conkling's speech on this occasion was one of interest. He outlined a
policy for which, he contended, his party in the Empire State ought to
stand. This was a new departure in New York. Heretofore, its chosen
representatives, keeping silent until a way had been mapped out in
Washington or elsewhere, preferred to follow. Conkling preferred to
lead. There was probably not a Republican in the State capable of
forming an opinion who did not know that from the moment Conkling
became a senator the division of the party into two stout factions was
merely a question of time. That time had not yet come, but even then
it was evident to the eye of a close observer that the action of the
Radicals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.174" id="Page_iii.174">iii. 174</a></span> led by Fenton, turned in a measure upon their distrust of
Conkling and his supporters.</p>

<p>This was manifest in the cool treatment accorded the New York City
delegates who represented the bolting Republicans of the year before.
Conkling's friends, disposed to be liberal, argued that the vote of a
&quot;returning sinner&quot; counted as much on election day as that of a saint.
On the other hand, the Fenton forces, while willing to benefit by the
suffrage of Conservatives, were disinclined to admit to the convention
men tainted with the sin of party treason, who would naturally
strengthen their adversaries. In the end, after a fierce struggle
which absorbed an entire session, the Conservatives were left out.</p>

<p>Opposition to the State officials who had shown a disposition to
favour the Senator was less open but no less effective. The exposure
of canal frauds in the preceding winter, showing that for a period of
six years trifling causes had been deemed sufficient to displace low
bids for high ones, thus greatly enriching a canal ring at the expense
of the State, involved only the Canal Commissioner. Indeed, every
reason existed why Barlow and his soldier associates whose army
records had strengthened their party in 1865 should receive the usual
endorsement of a renomination; but to avoid what, it was claimed,
might otherwise be regarded an invidious distinction, the Greeley
Radicals cleverly secured a new ticket.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> &quot;In their zeal to become
honest,&quot; said Horatio Seymour, &quot;the Republicans have pitched overboard
all the officials who have not robbed the treasury.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The platform no longer revealed differences in the party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.175" id="Page_iii.175">iii. 175</a></span> It affirmed
impartial suffrage, protested against maladministration and corruption
in State affairs, supported Congress in its policy of reconstruction,
and rebuked all tampering with the financial obligations of the Union.
Upon these plain, simple issues Conservatives and Radicals stood
united. Those who, in 1865, thought the restoration of the Union on
the President's plan would have been wise, conceded that under the
changed conditions in 1867 it would be impracticable as well as unsafe
and impolitic. Indeed, in his conduct of the <i>Times</i>, Raymond was
again in accord with the Republicans, but he did not seek to renew his
former relations with the party. Being complimented for &quot;keeping in
the background,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> he replied that &quot;when, a year ago, he declined a
re-election to Congress, it was for the purpose of devoting himself
wholly to the editorship of the <i>Times</i>, a position more to his taste
than any other, and which carries with it as much of influence,
honour, and substantial reward as any office in the gift of Presidents
or political parties.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Had he appreciated the truth of this wise
statement in 1864 his sun might not have set in a cloud. &quot;His
parliamentary failure,&quot; says Blaine, &quot;was a keen disappointment to
him, and was not improbably one among many causes which cut short a
brilliant and useful life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The passing of Raymond and the advent of John T. Hoffman as a factor
in the State illustrate the curious work often wrought by political
changes. Raymond's efforts in behalf of reconciliation and peace
happened to concur in point of time with the demands of Tammany for
Hoffman and home-rule, and the latter proved the more potent.</p>

<p>Hoffman's appearance in State politics marked the beginning of a new
era. The increased majority in New York City in 1866, so
disproportionate to other years, and the naturalisation of immigrants
at the rate of one thousand a day, regardless of the period of their
residence in the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.176" id="Page_iii.176">iii. 176</a></span>try,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> indicated that a new leader of the
first magnitude had appeared, and that methods which differentiated
all moral principles had been introduced. For ten years William Marcy
Tweed had been sachem or grand sachem of Tammany and chairman of its
general committee. In climbing the ladder of power he had had his ups
and downs. He endured several defeats, notably for assistant alderman,
for re-election to Congress after a service of one term, and for
sheriff of New York County. But his popularity suffered no eclipse.
Ever since he led the ropes as a volunteer fireman, carrying a
silver-mounted trumpet, a white fire coat, and a stiff hat, the young
men of his class had made a hero of the tall, graceful, athletic
chief. His smiles were winning and his manners magnetic. From leading
a fire company he quickly led the politics of his district and then of
his ward, utilising his popularity by becoming in 1859 a member of the
Board of Supervisors, and in 1863 deputy street commissioner. As
supervisor he influenced expenditures and the making of contracts,
while the street deputy-ship gave him control of thousands of
labourers and sent aldermen after him for jobs for their ward
supporters. Thus intrenched he dropped chair-making, a business
inherited from his father, put up the sign of lawyer, and became known
to friends and foes as Boss Tweed, a title to which he did not object.</p>

<p>Like Hoffman, Tweed had a most agreeable personality. Always
scrupulously neat in his dress and suave in manner, he possessed the
outward characteristics of a gentleman, being neither boastful nor
noisy, and never addicted to the drink or tobacco habit. To his
friends the warmth of his greeting and the heartiness of his
hand-shake evidenced the active sympathies expressed in numberless
deeds of kindness and charity. Yet he could be despotic. If he desired
a motion carried in his favour he neglected to call for negative
votes, warning opponents with significant glances of the danger of
incurring his displeasure. Once, when his ruling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.177" id="Page_iii.177">iii. 177</a></span> as chairman of a
Tammany nominating convention raised a storm of protests, he blocked
the plans of his adversaries by adjourning the meeting and turning off
the gas.</p>

<p>Although Tweed, perhaps, was often at fault in his estimate of men who
frequently deceived him, he selected his immediate lieutenants with
intelligent care. In 1857 he had George G. Barnard elected recorder
and Peter B. Sweeny district attorney. About the same time Richard B.
Connolly became county clerk. When Barnard's term expired in 1860 he
advanced him to the Supreme Court and took up Hoffman for recorder.
Later Hoffman became mayor and Connolly city comptroller. After
Hoffman's second promotion A. Oakey Hall was made mayor. In his way
each of these men contributed strength to the political junta which
was destined to grow in influence and power until it seemed
invincible. Hall had been a versifier, a writer of tales in prose, a
Know-nothing, a friend of Seward, and an anti-Tammany Democrat. As a
clubman, ambitious for social distinction, he was known as &quot;elegant
Oakey.&quot; Although &quot;without ballast,&quot; as Tweed admitted, he was
indispensable as an interesting speaker of considerable force, who
yielded readily to the demands of a boss. Connolly, suave and courtly,
was at heart so mean and crafty that Tweed himself held him in the
utmost contempt as a &quot;Slippery Dick.&quot; But he was a good bookkeeper.
Besides, however many leeches he harboured about him, his intimate
knowledge of Tweed's doings kept him in power. Perhaps Barnard, more
in the public eye than any other, had less legal learning than wit,
yet in spite of his foppish dress he never lacked sufficient dignity
to float the appearance of a learned judge. He was a handsome man,
tall and well proportioned, with peculiarly brilliant eyes, a jet
black moustache, light olive complexion, and a graceful carriage.
Whenever in trouble Tweed could safely turn to him without
disappointment. But the man upon whom the Boss most relied was Sweeny.
He was a great manipulator of men, acquiring the cognomen of Peter
Brains Sweeny in recognition of his admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.178" id="Page_iii.178">iii. 178</a></span> ability. He had little
taste for public life. Nevertheless, hidden from sight, without
conscience and without fear, his sly, patient intrigues surpassed
those of his great master. The <i>Tribune</i> called him &quot;the
Mephistopheles of Tammany.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>The questionable doings of some of these men had already attracted the
attention of the press. It was not then known that a thirty-five per
cent. rake-off on all bills paid by the city was divided between Tweed
and Connolly, or that Sweeny had stolen enough to pay $60,000 for his
confirmation as city chamberlain by the Board of Aldermen;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> but
the prompt subscription of $175,000 by a few members of Tammany for
the erection of a new hall on Fourteenth Street, the cornerstone of
which was laid on July 4, 1867, showed that some folks were rapidly
getting rich.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> In the year after Hoffman's defeat for governor the
aim of Tweed and his lieutenants was to carry city elections and
control State conventions, with dreams of making Hoffman governor and
then President, and of electing Tweed to the United States Senate.</p>

<p>With this ambitious scheme in view the Tammany braves, reaching Albany
on October 3, 1867, demanded that Hoffman be made president of the
Democratic State convention. It was a bold claim for a defeated
candidate. After Fenton's election in 1864 Seymour had deemed it
proper to remain in the background, and for two years did not attend a
State convention. He had now reappeared, and the up-State delegates,
delighted at his return, insisted upon his election as president.
Instantly this became the issue. The friends of the Governor pointed
to his achievements and to his distinguished position as the great
apostle of Democracy. On the other hand, Tammany, with its usual
assurance, talked of its 50,000 majority given the Democratic ticket
in 1866, declared that Seymour had had enough, and that Hoffman needed
the endorsement to secure his re-election as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.179" id="Page_iii.179">iii. 179</a></span> mayor in the following
December. Thus the contest raged. Tammany was imperious and the
country delegates stubborn. One year before these men had allowed
their better judgment to be coerced into a condemnation of John A. Dix
because of his alleged ill treatment of Democrats; but now, standing
like a stone wall for Seymour, they followed their convictions as to
the best interests of the party. In the end Hoffman became temporary
chairman and Seymour president. The generous applause that greeted
Hoffman's appearance must have satisfied his most ardent friend until
he witnessed the spontaneous and effusive welcome accorded Seymour. If
it was noisy, it was also hearty. It had the ring of real joy, mingled
with an admiration that is bestowed only upon a leader who captivates
the imagination by recalling glorious victory and exciting high hopes
of future success.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>The selection of candidates provoked no real contests,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> but the
platform presented serious difficulties. The Democratic party
throughout the country found it hard to digest the war debt. Men who
believed it had been multiplied by extravagance and corruption in the
prosecution of an unholy war, thought it should be repudiated
outright, while many others, especially in the Western States, would
pay it in the debased currency of the realm. To people whose
circulating medium before the war was mainly the bills of wild-cat
banks, greenbacks seemed like actual money and the best money they had
ever known. It was attractive and everywhere of uniform value.
Moreover, as the Government was behind it the necessity for gold and
silver no longer appealed to them. The popular policy, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.180" id="Page_iii.180">iii. 180</a></span>
made the 5-20 bonds payable in greenbacks instead of coin. Of the
whole interest-bearing debt of $2,200,000,000, there were outstanding
about $1,600,000,000 of 5-20's, or securities convertible into them,
and of these $500,000,000 became redeemable in 1867. Their redemption
in gold, worth from 132 to 150, it was argued, would not only be a
discrimination in favour of the rich, but a foolish act of generosity,
since the law authorising the bonds stipulated that the interest
should be paid in &quot;coin&quot; and the principal in &quot;dollars.&quot; As greenbacks
were lawful money they were also &quot;dollars&quot; within the meaning of the
legal tender act, and although an inflation of the currency, made
necessary by the redemption of bonds, might increase the price of gold
and thus amount to practical repudiation, it would in nowise modify
the law making the bonds payable in paper &quot;dollars.&quot; This was known as
the &quot;Ohio idea.&quot; It was a popular scheme with debtors, real estate
owners, shopkeepers, and business men generally, who welcomed
inflation as an antidote for the Secretary of the Treasury's
contraction of the currency. Democratic politicians accepted this
policy the more readily, too, because of the attractive cry&#8212;&quot;the same
currency for the bondholder and the ploughboy.&quot;</p>

<p>There was much of this sentiment in New York. Extreme Democrats,
taught that the debt was corruptly incurred, resented the suggestion
of its payment in gold. &quot;Bloated bondholders&quot; became a famous
expression with them, to whom it seemed likely that the $700,000,000
of United States notes, if inflated to an amount sufficient to pay the
bonds, would ultimately force absolute repudiation. These views found
ready acceptance among delegates to the State convention, and to put
himself straight upon the record, John T. Hoffman, in his speech as
temporary chairman, boldly declared &quot;the honour of the country pledged
to the payment of every dollar of the national debt, honestly and
fully, in the spirit as well as in the letter of the bond.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.181" id="Page_iii.181">iii. 181</a></span></p>
<p>Seymour, with his usual dexterity, declined to commit himself or his
party to any decided policy. Although he would &quot;keep the public
faith,&quot; and &quot;not add repudiation to the list of crimes which destroy
confidence in republican governments,&quot; his arguments shed no light on
the meaning of those words. He declared that &quot;waste and corruption had
piled up the national debt,&quot; and that it was &quot;criminal folly to exempt
bonds from taxation.&quot; Then, entering into a general discussion of
finance, he arraigned the war party for its extravagance, infidelity,
and plundering policy. &quot;Those who hold the power,&quot; he said, &quot;have not
only hewed up to the line of repudiation, but they have not tried to
give value to the public credit. It is not the bondholder, it is the
office holder who sucks the blood of the people. If the money
collected by the government was paid to lessen our debt we could
command the specie of the world. We could gain it in exchange for our
securities as the governments of Europe do. Now, they are peddled out
at half price in exchange for dry-goods and groceries. The reports of
the Secretary of the Treasury show that we could swiftly wipe out our
debt if our income was not diverted to partisan purposes. Do not the
columns of the press teem with statements of official plunder and
frauds in every quarter of our land, while public virtue rots under
this wasteful expenditure of the public fund? It is said it is
repudiation to force our legal tenders upon the bondholders. What
makes it so? The low credit of the country. Build that up; make your
paper as good as gold, and this question cannot come up. The
controversy grows out of the fact that men do not believe our legal
tenders ever will be as good as gold. If it is repudiation to pay such
money, it is repudiation to make it, and it is repudiation to keep it
debased by waste and by partisan plans to keep our country in disorder
and danger.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps no American ever possessed a more irritating way of presenting
the frailties of an opposite party. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.182" id="Page_iii.182">iii. 182</a></span> unwholesome sentiment of his
Tweddle Hall and draft-riot speeches, so shockingly out of key with
the music of the Union, provoked the charge of sinning against clear
light; but ordinarily he had such a faculty for skilfully blending
truth with hyperbole in a daring and spirited argument that Greeley,
who could usually expose the errors of an opponent's argument in a
dozen sentences, found it woven too closely for hasty answer. On this
occasion his speech compelled the committee on resolutions, after an
all day and night session, to refer the matter to Samuel J. Tilden and
two associates, who finally evaded the whole issue by declaring for
&quot;equal taxation.&quot; This meant taxation of government bonds without
specification as to their payment. John McKeon of New York City
attacked the words as &quot;equivocal&quot; and &quot;without moral effect,&quot; but the
influence of Seymour and Tilden carried it with practical unanimity.</p>

<p>The power of Seymour, however, best exhibited itself in the treatment
accorded Andrew Johnson. The conventions of 1865 and 1866 had
sustained the President with energy and earnestness, endorsing his
policy, commending his integrity, and encouraging him to believe in
the sincerity of their support. In recognition Johnson had displaced
Republicans for Democrats until the men in office resembled the
appointees of Buchanan's administration. The proceedings of the
convention of 1867, however, contained no evidence that the United
States had a Chief Executive. Nothing could have been more
remorseless. The plan, silently matured, was suddenly and without
scruple flashed upon the country that Andrew Johnson, divested of
respect, stripped of support, and plucked of offices, had been coolly
dropped by the Democracy of the Empire State.</p>

<p>The campaign opened badly for the Republicans. Weighted with canal
frauds the party, with all its courage and genius, seemed unequal to
the odds against which it was forced to contend. The odious
disclosures showed that the most trifling technicalities, often only a
misspelled or an interlined word, and in one instance, at least,
simply an ink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.183" id="Page_iii.183">iii. 183</a></span> blot, had been held sufficient to vacate the lowest
bids, the contracts afterward being assigned to other bidders at
largely increased amounts. So insignificant were these informalities
that in many cases the official who declared the bids irregular could
not tell upon the witness stand wherein they were so, although he
admitted that in no instance did the State benefit by the change.
Indeed, without cunning or reason, the plunderers, embracing all who
made or paid canal accounts, declared bids informal that contracts at
increased prices might be given to members of a ring who divided their
ill-gotten gains. These increases ranged from $1,000 to $100,000 each,
aggregating a loss to the State of many hundreds of thousands of
dollars. &quot;The corruption is so enormous,&quot; said the <i>World</i>, &quot;as to
render absurd any attempt at concealment.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>Republicans offered no defence except that their party, having had the
courage to investigate and expose the frauds and the methods of the
peculators, could be trusted to continue the reform. To this the
<i>World</i> replied that &quot;a convention of shoddyites might, with as good a
face, have lamented the rags hanging about the limbs of our shivering
soldiers, or a convention of whisky thieves affect to deplore the
falling off of the internal revenue.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Moreover, Democrats claimed
that the worst offender was still in office as an appointee of
Governor Fenton,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and that the Republican nominee for canal
commissioner had been guilty of similar transactions when
superintendent of one of the waterways.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> These charges became the
more glaring because Republicans refused to renominate senators who
had been chiefly instrumental in exposing the frauds. &quot;They take great
credit to themselves for having found out this cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.184" id="Page_iii.184">iii. 184</a></span>ruption in the
management of the canals,&quot; said Seymour. &quot;But how did they exhibit
their hatred of corruption? Were the men who made these exposures
renominated? Not by the Republicans. One of them is running upon our
ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> On another occasion he declared that &quot;not one of the
public officers who are charged and convicted by their own friends of
fraud and robbery have ever been brought to the bar of justice.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
The severity of such statements lost none of its sting by the
declaration of Horace Greeley, made over his own signature, that
Republican candidates were &quot;conspicuous for integrity and for
resistance to official corruption.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The practical failure of the constitutional convention to accomplish
the purpose for which it assembled also embarrassed Republicans. By
the terms of the Constitution of 1846 the Legislature was required, in
each twentieth year thereafter, to submit to the people the question
of convening a convention for its revision, and in 1866, an
affirmative answer being given, such a convention began its work at
Albany on June 4, 1867. Of the one hundred and sixty delegates,
ninety-seven were Republicans. Its membership included many men of the
highest capacity, whose debates, characterised by good temper and
forensic ability, showed an intelligent knowledge of the needs of the
State. Their work included the payment of the canal and other State
debts, extended the term of senators from two to four years, increased
the members of the Assembly, conferred the right of suffrage without
distinction of colour, reorganised the Court of Appeals with a chief
justice and six associate justices, and increased the tenure of
supreme and appellate judges to fourteen years, with an age limit of
seventy.</p>

<p>Very early in the life of the convention, however, the press, largely
influenced by the New York <i>Tribune</i>, began to discredit its work.
Horace Greeley, who was a member, talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.185" id="Page_iii.185">iii. 185</a></span> often and always well, but
the more he talked the more he revealed his incapacity for safe
leadership. He seemed to grow restive as he did in Congress over
immaterial matters. Long speeches annoyed him, and adjournments from
Friday to the following Tuesday sorely vexed him, although this
arrangement convenienced men of large business interests. Besides,
committees not being ready to report, there was little to occupy the
time of delegates. Nevertheless, Greeley, accustomed to work without
limit as to hours or thought of rest, insisted that the convention
ought to keep busy six days in the week and finish the revision for
which it assembled. When his power to influence colleagues had
entirely disappeared, he began using the <i>Tribune</i>, whose acrid
arguments, accepted by the lesser newspapers, completely undermined
all achievement. Finally, on September 24, the convention recessed
until November 12.</p>

<p>Democrats charged at once that the adjournment was a skulking
subterfuge not only to avoid an open confession of failure, but to
evade submitting negro suffrage to a vote in November. The truth of
the assertion seemed manifest. At all events, it proved a most serious
handicap to Republicans, who, by an act of Congress, passed on March
2, 1867, had forced negro suffrage upon the Southern States. Their
platform, adopted at Syracuse, also affirmed it. Moreover, their
absolute control of the constitutional convention enabled them, if
they had so desired, to finish and submit their work in the early
autumn. This action subjected their convention resolve for &quot;impartial
suffrage&quot; to ridicule as well as to the charge of cowardice. If you
shrink from giving the ballot to a few thousand negroes at home, it
was asked, why do you insist that it should be conferred on millions
in the South? If, as you pretend, you wish the blacks of this State to
have the ballot, why do you not give it to them? How can you blame the
South for hesitating when you hesitate? &quot;It is manifest,&quot; said the
<i>World</i>, &quot;that the Republicans do not desire the negroes of this State
to vote. Their refusal to present the question in this election is a
confession that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.186" id="Page_iii.186">iii. 186</a></span> the party is forcing on the South a measure too
odious to be tolerated at home.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>This charge, perhaps, was the most disturbing influence Republicans
had to meet in the campaign. Responsibility for canal frauds made them
wince, since it appealed strongly and naturally to whatever there was
of discontent among the people, but their apparent readiness to force
upon the South what they withheld in New York seemed so unreasonable
and unjust that it aided materially in swelling the strength of the
Democrats.</p>

<p>James T. Brady, Henry C. Murphy, John T. Hoffman, and Samuel J. Tilden
made the campaign attractive, speaking with unsparing severity to the
great audiences gathered in New York City. Although somewhat
capricious in his sympathies, Brady seemed never to care who knew what
he thought on any subject, while the people, captivated by his
marvellously easy mode of speech, listened with rapture as he
exercised his splendid powers. It remained for Seymour, however, to
give character to the discussion in one of his most forcible
philippics. He endeavoured to show that the ballot, given to a few
negroes in New York, could do little harm compared to the
enfranchisement of millions of them in the Southern States. The
Radicals, he said, not only propose to put the white men of the South
under the blacks, but the white men of the North as well. To allow
three millions of negroes, representing ten Southern States, to send
twenty senators to Washington, while more than half the white
population of the country, living in nine Northern States, have but
eighteen senators, is a home question. &quot;Will you sanction it?&quot; he
asked. &quot;Twenty senators, recollect, who are to act in relation to
interests deeply affecting you. Can you afford to erect such a
government of blacks over the white men of this continent? Will you
give them control in the United States Senate and thus in fact
disfranchise the North? This to you is a local question. It will
search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.187" id="Page_iii.187">iii. 187</a></span> you out just as surely as the tax-gatherer searches you
out.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Republicans acknowledged their weakness. An opposition that invited
attention to disclosures as sensational and corrupt as they were
indefensible had deeper roots than ordinary political rivalry, while
the question of manhood suffrage, like a legacy of reciprocal hate,
aroused the smouldering prejudices that had found bitter expression
during the discussion of emancipation. Moreover, the feeling developed
that the narrow and unpatriotic policy which ruled the Syracuse
convention had displaced good men for unsatisfactory candidates. This
led to the substitution of Thomas H. Hillhouse for comptroller, whose
incorruptibility made him a candidate of unusual strength. But the
sacrifice did not change the political situation, aggravated among
other things by hard times. The wave of commercial depression which
spread over Europe after the London financial panic of May, 1866,
extended to this country during the last half of 1867. A reaction from
the inflated war prices took place, quick sales and large profits
ceased, and a return to the old methods of frugality and good
management became necessary. In less than two years the currency had
been contracted $140,000,000, decreasing the price of property and
enhancing the face value of debts, and although Congress, in the
preceding February, had suspended further contraction, business men
charged financial conditions to contraction and the people held the
party in power responsible.</p>

<p>Indeed, the people had become tired of Republican rule, and their
verdict changed a plurality of 13,000, given Fenton in 1866, to a
Democratic majority of nearly 48,000, with twenty-two majority on
joint ballot in the Legislature. New York City gave the Democrats
60,000 majority. Thousands of immigrants had been illegally
naturalised, and a fraudulent registration of 1,500 in one ward
indicated the extent of the enormous frauds that had been practised by
Boss Tweed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.188" id="Page_iii.188">iii. 188</a></span> and his gang;<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> but the presence of large Democratic
gains in the up-State counties showed that Republican defeat was due
to other causes than fraudulent registration and illegal voting.
&quot;Outside the incapables and their miserable subalterns who managed the
Syracuse convention,&quot; said one Republican paper, &quot;a pervading
sentiment existed among us, not only that we should be beaten, but
that we needed chastisement.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Another placed the responsibility
upon &quot;a host of political adventurers, attracted to the party by
selfish aggrandisements.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The <i>Tribune</i> accepted it as a
punishment for cowardice on the negro suffrage question. &quot;To say that
we are for manhood suffrage in the South and not in the North is to
earn the loathing, contempt, and derision alike of friends and
foes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Thus had Republican power disappeared like Aladdin's
palace, which was ablaze with splendour at night, and could not be
seen in the morning.</p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> fall elections of 1867 made a profound impression in the Empire
State. Pennsylvania gave a small Democratic majority, Ohio defeated a
negro suffrage amendment by 50,000, besides electing a Democratic
legislature, and New York, leading the Democratic column, surprised
the nation with a majority of nearly 48,000. In every county the
Republican vote had fallen off. It was plain that reconstruction and
negro suffrage had seriously disgruntled the country. The policy of
the Republicans, therefore, which had hitherto been one of delay in
admitting Southern States to representation in Congress, now changed
to one of haste to get them in, the party believing that with negro
enfranchisement and white disfranchisement it could control the South.
This sudden change had alarmed conservatives of all parties, and the
Democratic strength shown at the preceding election encouraged the
belief that the radical work of Congress might be overthrown. &quot;The
danger now is,&quot; wrote John Sherman, &quot;that the mistakes of the
Republicans may drift the Democratic party into power.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>The action of Congress after the removal of Edwin M. Stanton, then
secretary of war, did not weaken this prediction. The Senate had
already refused its assent to the Secretary's suspension, and when the
President, exercising what he believed to be his constitutional power,
appointed Adjutant-General Thomas in his place, it brought the contest
to a crisis. Stanton, barricaded in the War Office, refused to leave,
while Thomas, bolder in talk than in deeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.190" id="Page_iii.190">iii. 190</a></span> threatened to kick him
out.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> In support of Stanton a company of one hundred men, mustered
by John A. Logan, a member of Congress, occupied the basement of the
War Department. Not since the assassination of Lincoln had the country
been in such a state of excitement. Meanwhile former propositions of
impeachment were revived, and although without evidence of guilty
intent, the House, on February 14, resolved that Andrew Johnson be
impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours. This trial, which
continued for nearly three months, kept the country flushed with
passion.</p>

<p>New York Democrats greatly enjoyed the situation. To them it meant a
division of the Republican party vastly more damaging than the one in
1866. Opposition to Grant's candidacy also threatened to widen the
breach. The Conservatives, led by Thurlow Weed, wishing to break the
intolerant control of the Radicals by securing a candidate free from
factional bias, had pronounced for the Soldier's nomination for
President as early as July, 1867,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and although the current of
Republican journalism as well as the drift of party sentiment tended
to encourage the movement, the Radicals opposed it. Grant's report on
the condition of the South in 1865, and his attendance upon the
President in 1866 during the famous swing-around-the-circle, had
provoked much criticism. Besides, his acceptance of the War Office
after Stanton's suspension indicated marked confidence in the Chief
Executive. Indeed, so displeasing had been his record since the close
of the war that the <i>Tribune</i> ridiculed his pretensions, predicting
that if any man of his type of politics was elected it would be by the
Democrats.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Even after the loss of the elections the <i>Tribune</i>
continued its opposition. &quot;We object to the Grant movement,&quot; it said.
&quot;It is of the ostrich's simple strategy that deceives only himself.
There are times in which personal preference and personal popularity
go far; but they are not these times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.191" id="Page_iii.191">iii. 191</a></span> Does any one imagine that
General Grant, supported by the Republicans, would carry Maryland or
Kentucky, under her present Constitution, against Seymour or
Pendleton?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Many agreed with Greeley. Indeed, a majority of the
Radicals, deeming Grant unsound on reconstruction and the negro,
preferred Chief Justice Chase.</p>

<p>Very unexpectedly, however, conditions changed. Stanton's suspension
in August, 1867, led to Grant's appointment as secretary of war, but
when the Senate, early in the following January, refused to concur in
Johnson's action, Grant locked the door of the War Office and resumed
his post at army headquarters. The President expressed surprise that
he did not hold the office until the question of Stanton's
constitutional right to resume it could be judicially determined. This
criticism, delivered in Johnson's positive style, provoked a long and
heated controversy, involving the veracity of each and leaving them
enemies for life. The quarrel delighted the Radicals. It put Grant
into sympathy with Congress, and Republicans into sympathy with Grant.
Until then it was not clear to what party he belonged. Before the war
he acted with the Democrats, and very recently the successors of the
old Albany Regency had been quietly preparing for his nomination.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
Now, however, he was in cordial relation with Republicans, whose
convention, held at Syracuse on February 5, 1868, to select delegates
to the National convention, indorsed his candidacy by acclamation. The
Conservatives welcomed this action as their victory. Moreover, it was
the first formal expression of a State convention. Republicans of
other Commonwealths had indicated their readiness to accept Grant as a
candidate, but New York, endorsing him before the termination of his
controversy with the President, anticipated their action and set the
party aflame. Indeed, it looked to Republicans as if this nomination
assured success at a moment when their chances had seemed hopeless.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.192" id="Page_iii.192">iii. 192</a></span></p>
<p>In like manner the convention recommended Reuben E. Fenton for
Vice-President. Fenton had made an acceptable governor. Under his
administration projects for lengthening the locks on the Erie Canal
and other plans for extending the facilities of transportation were
presented. Another memorable work was the establishment of Cornell
University, which has aptly been called &quot;the youngest, the largest,
and the richest&quot; of the nearly thirty colleges in the State. Even the
<i>Times</i>, the great organ of the Conservatives, admitted that the
Governor's &quot;executive control, in the main, has been a success.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
Opposition to his promotion, however, presented well-defined lines. To
Thurlow Weed he represented the mismanagement which defeated the
party,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and to Conkling he appealed only as one on whom to employ
with effect, when occasion offered, his remarkable resources of
sarcasm and rhetoric. The Governor understood this feeling, and to
avoid its influence delegates were instructed to vote for him as a
unit, while three hundred devoted friends went to Chicago. Daniel E.
Sickles became chairman of the delegation.</p>

<p>The Republican convention convened at Chicago on May 20, and amidst
throat-bursting cheers and salvos of artillery Ulysses S. Grant was
nominated for President by acclamation. For Vice-President a dozen
candidates were presented, including Henry Wilson of Massachusetts,
Reuben E. Fenton of New York, Benjamin Wade of Ohio, and Schuyler
Colfax of Indiana. Fenton's friends, finding the Northern States
pre-empted by other candidates, turned to the South, hoping to benefit
as Wade's strength receded. Here, however, it was manifest that Wilson
would become the Buckeye's residuary legatee. Fenton also suffered
from the over-zeal of friends. In seconding his nomination an Illinois
delegate encountered John A. Logan, who coolly remarked that Fenton
would get three votes and no more from his State. To recover prestige
after this blow Daniel E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.193" id="Page_iii.193">iii. 193</a></span> Sickles, in a brief speech, deftly included
him with Morton of Indiana, Curtin of Pennsylvania, Andrew of
Massachusetts, and other great war governors. In this company Fenton,
who had served less than four months at the close of the war, seemed
out of place, and Sickles resumed his seat undisturbed by any
demonstration except by the faithful three hundred.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Fenton's
vote, however, was more pronounced than the applause, although his
strength outside of New York came largely from the South, showing that
his popularity centred in a section whose representatives in National
Republican conventions have too often succumbed to influences other
than arguments.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>The echo of Fenton's defeat seriously disturbed the Syracuse State
convention (July 8). The Conservatives of New York City, many of whom
had now become the followers of Conkling, objected to the Fenton
method of selecting delegates, and after a bitter discussion between
Matthew Hale of Albany and Charles S. Spencer, the Governor's ardent
friend, the convention limited the number of delegates from a city
district to the Republican vote actually cast, and appointed a
committee to investigate the quarrel, with instructions to report at
the next State convention.</p>

<p>The selection of a candidate for governor also unsettled the
Republican mind. Friends of Lyman Tremaine, Charles H. Van Wyck,
Frederick A. Conkling (a brother of the Senator), Stewart L. Woodford,
and John A. Griswold had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.194" id="Page_iii.194">iii. 194</a></span> not neglected to put their favourites into
the field at an early day, but to all appearances Horace Greeley was
the popular man among the delegates. Although Conkling had snuffed out
his senatorial ambition, he had been the directing power of the
February convention, and was still the recognised guide-post of the
party. Besides, the withdrawal of Tremaine, Van Wyck, and Conkling
practically narrowed the rivalry to Greeley and Griswold. Indeed, it
seemed as if the ambition of the editor's life was at last to be
satisfied. Weed was in Europe, Raymond still rested &quot;outside the
breastworks,&quot; and the Twenty-third Street organisation, as the
Conservatives were called, sat on back seats without votes and without
influence.</p>

<p>Greeley did not go to Syracuse. But his personal friends appeared in
force, led by Reuben E. Fenton, who controlled the State convention.
Greeley believed the Governor sincerely desired his nomination.
Perhaps he was also deceived in the strength of John A. Griswold. The
people, regarding Griswold's change from McClellan to Lincoln as a
political emancipation, had doubled his majority for Congress in 1864
and again in 1866. The poor loved him, the workmen admired him, and
business men backed him. Though but forty-six years old he had already
made his existence memorable. In their emphasis orators expressed no
fear that the fierce white light which beats upon an aspirant for high
office would disclose in him poor judgment, or any weakness of
character. To these optimistic speeches delegates evinced a
responsiveness that cheered his friends.</p>

<p>But the real noise of the day did not commence until Chauncey M. Depew
began his eulogy of the great editor. The applause then came in drifts
of cheers as appreciative expressions fell from the lips of his
champion. It was admitted that Depew's speech adorned the day's
work.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> He referred to Greeley as &quot;the embodiment of the principles
of his party,&quot; &quot;the one man towering above all others in in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.195" id="Page_iii.195">iii. 195</a></span>tellect,&quot;
who &quot;has contributed more than any other man toward the
enfranchisement of the slaves,&quot; and &quot;with his pen and his tongue has
done more for the advancement of the industrial classes.&quot; In
conclusion, said the speaker, &quot;he belongs to no county, to no
locality; he belongs to the State and to the whole country, because of
the superiority of his intellect and the purity of his
patriotism.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> As the speaker finished, the applause, lasting &quot;many
minutes,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> finally broke into several rounds of cheers, while
friends of Griswold as well as those of Greeley, standing on chairs,
swung hats and umbrellas after the fashion of a modern convention.
Surely, Horace Greeley was the favourite.</p>

<p>The roll-call, however, gave Griswold 247, Greeley 95, Woodford 36.
For the moment Greeley's friends seemed stunned. It was worse than a
defeat&#8212;it was utter rout and confusion. He had been led into an
ambuscade and slaughtered. The <i>Tribune</i>, in explaining the affair,
said &quot;it was evident in the morning that Griswold would get the
nomination. His friends had been working so long and there were so
many outstanding pledges.&quot; Besides, it continued, &quot;when the fact
developed that he had a majority, it added to his strength
afterward.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Why, then, it was asked, did Greeley's friends put
him into a contest already settled? Did they wish to humiliate him?
&quot;Had Greeley been here in person,&quot; said the <i>Times</i>, with apparent
sympathy, &quot;the result might have been different.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The <i>Nation</i>
thought otherwise. &quot;In public,&quot; it said, &quot;few members of conventions
have the courage to deny his fitness for any office, such are the
terrors inspired by his editorial cowskin; but the minute the voting
by ballots begins, the cowardly fellows repudiate him under the veil
of secrecy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The great disparity between the applause and the
vote for the editor became the subject of much suppressed amusement.
&quot;The highly wrought eulogium pronounced by Depew was applauded to the
echo,&quot; wrote a correspondent of the <i>Times</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.196" id="Page_iii.196">iii. 196</a></span> &quot;but the enthusiasm
subsided wonderfully when it came to putting him at the head of the
ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Depew himself appreciated the humour of the situation.
&quot;Everybody wondered,&quot; said the eulogist, speaking of it in later
years, &quot;how there could be so much smoke and so little fire.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> To
those conversant with the situation, however, it was not a mystery.
Among conservative men Greeley suffered discredit because of his
ill-tempered criticisms, while his action in signing Jefferson Davis's
bail-bond was not the least powerful of the many influences that
combined to weaken his authority. It seemed to shatter confidence in
his strength of mind. After that episode the sale of his <i>American
Conflict</i> which had reached the rate of five hundred copies a day,
fell off so rapidly that his publishers lost $50,000.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>The platform approved the nomination of Grant and Colfax, held
inviolate the payment of the public debt in the spirit as well as the
letter of the law, commended the administration of Fenton, and
demanded absolute honesty in the management and improvement of the
canals; but adopting &quot;the simple tactics of the ostrich&quot; it maintained
the most profound silence in regard to suffrage of any kind&#8212;manhood,
universal, impartial, or negro.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>The day the Syracuse convention avoided Greeley, the National
Democratic convention which had assembled in Tammany's new building on
July 4, accepted a leader under whom victory was impossible. It was an
historic gathering. The West sent able leaders to support its
favourite greenback theory, the South's delegation of Confederate
officers recalled the picturesque scenes at Philadelphia in 1866, and
New England and the Middle States furnished a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.197" id="Page_iii.197">iii. 197</a></span> array of their
well-known men. Samuel J. Tilden headed the New York delegation,
Horatio Seymour became permanent president, and in one of the chairs
set apart for vice presidents, William M. Tweed, &quot;fat, oily, and
dripping with the public wealth,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> represented the Empire State.</p>

<p>The chairmanship of the committee on resolutions fell to Henry C.
Murphy of Brooklyn. Murphy was a brave fighter. In 1832, when barely
in his twenties, he had denounced the policy of chartering banks in
the interest of political favourites and monopolists, and the reform,
soon after established, made him bold to attack other obnoxious fiscal
systems. As mayor of Brooklyn he kept the city's expenditures within
its income, and in the constitutional convention of 1846 he stood with
Michael Hoffman in preserving the public credit and the public faith.
To him who understood the spirit of the Legal Tender Act of 1862, it
seemed rank dishonesty to pay bonds in a depreciated currency, and he
said so in language that did not die in the committee room. But
opposed to him were the extremists who controlled the convention.
These Greenbackers demanded &quot;that all obligations of the government,
not payable by their express terms in coin, ought to be paid in lawful
money,&quot; and through them the Ohio heresy became the ruling thought of
the Democratic creed.</p>

<p>Although New York consented to the Pendleton platform, it determined
not to sacrifice everything to the one question of finance by
permitting the nomination of the Ohio statesman. There were other
candidates. Andrew Johnson was deluded into the belief that he had a
chance; Winfield S. Hancock, the hero of the famous Second Army Corps,
who had put himself in training while department commander at New
Orleans, believed in his star; Salmon P. Chase, chief justice of the
United States Supreme Court, having failed to capture the nomination
at Chicago, was willing to lead whenever and by whomsoever called;
while Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana, then a United States senator
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.198" id="Page_iii.198">iii. 198</a></span> supporter of the &quot;Ohio idea,&quot; hoped to succeed if Pendleton
failed. Of these candidates Seymour favoured Chase. If nominated, he
said, the Chief Justice would disintegrate the Republican party, carry
Congress, and by uniting conservative Republicans and Democrats secure
a majority of the Senate. It was known that the sentiments of Chase
harmonised with those of Eastern Democrats except as to negro
suffrage, and although on this issue the Chief Justice declined to
yield, Seymour did not regard it of sufficient importance to quarrel
about. Indeed, it was said that Seymour had approved a platform,
submitted to Chase by Democratic progressionists, which accepted negro
suffrage.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Samuel J. Tilden, appreciating the importance of defeating Pendleton,
at once directed all the resources of a cold, calculating nature to a
solution of the difficult problem. To mask his real purpose he pressed
the name of Sanford E. Church until the eighth ballot, when he
adroitly dropped it for Hendricks. It was a bold move. The Hoosier was
not less offensive than the Buckeye, but it served Tilden's purpose to
dissemble, and, as he apprehended, Hendricks immediately took the
votes of his own and other States from the Ohioan. This proved the end
of Pendleton, whose vote thenceforth steadily declined. On the
thirteenth ballot California cast half a vote for Chase, throwing the
convention into wild applause. For the moment it looked as if the
Chief Justice, still in intimate correspondence with influential
delegates, might capture the nomination. Vallandigham, who preferred
Chase to Hendricks, begged Tilden to cast New York's vote for him, but
the man of sheer intellect was not yet ready to show his hand.
Meanwhile Hancock divided with Hendricks the lost strength of
Pendleton. Amidst applause from Tammany, Nebraska, on the seventeenth
and eighteenth ballots, cast three votes for John T. Hoffman. This
closed the fourth day of the convention, the eighteenth ballot
registering 144&#189; votes for Hancock, 87 for Hendricks, 56&#189; for
Pendleton, and 28 scattering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.199" id="Page_iii.199">iii. 199</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the fifth and last day, the New York delegation,
before entering the convention, decided by a vote of 37 to 24 to
support Chase provided Hendricks could not be nominated. Seymour
favoured the Chief Justice in an elaborate speech, which he intended
delivering on the floor of the convention, and for this purpose had
arranged with a delegate from Missouri to occupy the chair. It was
known, too, that Chase's strength had increased in other delegations.
Eleven Ohio delegates favoured him as their second choice, while
Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Georgia, and Wisconsin could be
depended upon. Indeed, it was in the air that the Chief Justice would
be nominated. When the convention opened, however, a letter several
days old was read from Pendleton withdrawing from the contest. This
quickly pushed Hendricks to 107. On the twenty-first ballot he rose to
132 and Hancock fell off to 135&#189;, while four votes for Chase, given
by Massachusetts, called out hisses<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> as well as applause,
indicating that the ambitious Justice was not entirely <i>persona grata</i>
to all of the Westerners. To the confused delegates, worn out with
loss of sleep and the intense heat, the situation did not excite hopes
of an early settlement. New York could not name Chase since
Pendleton's withdrawal had strengthened Hendricks, while the
nomination of a conservative Union soldier like Hancock, so soon after
the close of the war, would inevitably exasperate the more radical
element of the party. Thus it looked as if the motion to adjourn to
meet at St. Louis in September presented the only escape. Pending a
roll-call, however, this motion was declared out of order, and the
voting continued until the Ohio delegation, having returned from a
conference, boldly proposed the name of Horatio Seymour. The
delegates, hushed into silence by the dominating desire to verify
rumours of an impending change, now gave vent to long, excited
cheering. &quot;The folks were frantic,&quot; said an eyewitness; &quot;the delegates
daft. All other enthusiasms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.200" id="Page_iii.200">iii. 200</a></span> as babbling brooks to the eternal
thunder of Niagara. The whole mass was given over to acclaims that
cannot even be suggested in print.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Seymour had positively declined a score of times. As early as
November, 1867, after the Democratic victories of that month, he had
addressed a letter to the <i>Union</i>, a Democratic paper of Oneida,
stating that for personal reasons which he need not give, he was not
and could not be a candidate. Other letters of similar purport had
frequently appeared in the press. To an intimate friend he spoke of
family griefs, domestic troubles, impaired health, and the
impossibility of an election. Besides, if chosen, he said, he would be
as powerless as Johnson, a situation that &quot;would put him in his grave
in less than a year.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> In the whole convention there was not a man
who could truthfully say that the Governor, by look, or gesture, or
inflection of voice, had encouraged the hope of a change of mind.
Within forty-eight hours every Democrat of influence had sounded him
and gone away sorrowful. Now, when order was restored, he declined
again. His expressions of gratitude seemed only to make the
declaration stronger. &quot;I do not stand here,&quot; he said, &quot;as a man proud
of his opinion or obstinate in his purposes, but upon a question of
duty and of honour I must stand upon my own convictions against the
world. When I said here, at an early day, that honour forbade my
accepting a nomination, I meant it. When I said to my friends I could
not be a candidate, I meant it. And now, after all that has taken
place here, I could not receive the nomination without placing myself
in a false position. Gentlemen, I thank you for your kindness, but
your candidate I cannot be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Vallandigham replied that in times of great public exigency personal
consideration should yield to the public good, and Francis Kernan,
disclaiming any lot or part in Ohio's motion, declared that others
than the New York delegation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.201" id="Page_iii.201">iii. 201</a></span> must overcome the sensitiveness of the
chairman. Still, he said, Horatio Seymour ought to abide the action of
the convention. These speeches over, the roll-call monotonously
continued, each State voting as before until Wisconsin changed from
Doolittle to Seymour. In an instant the chairman of each State
delegation, jumping to his feet, changed its vote to the New Yorker.
The pandemonium was greater than before, in the midst of which
Seymour, apparently overwhelmed by the outcome, retired to a committee
room, where Church, Joseph Warren of the Buffalo <i>Courier</i>, and other
friends urged him to yield to the demands of the Democracy of the
country. He was deeply affected. Tears filled his eyes, and he
piteously sought the sympathy of friends.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Soon after he left the
building. Meanwhile Tilden rose to change the vote of the Empire State
from Hendricks to Seymour. &quot;It is fit on this occasion,&quot; he said,
&quot;that New York should wait for the voice of all her sister States.
Last evening I did not believe this event possible. There was one
obstacle&#8212;Horatio Seymour's earnest, sincere, deep-felt repugnance to
accept this nomination. I did not believe any circumstance would make
it possible except that Ohio, with whom we have been unfortunately
dividing our votes, demanded it. I was anxious that whenever we should
leave this convention there should be no heart-burnings, no jealousy,
no bitter disappointment; and I believe that in this result we have
lifted the convention far above every such consideration. And I
believe further that we have made the nomination most calculated to
give us success.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>This did not then seem to be the opinion of many men outside the
convention. The nomination did not arouse even a simulated enthusiasm
upon the streets of the metropolis.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> In Washington Democratic
congressmen declared that but one weaker candidate was before the
convention,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> while dispatches from Philadelphia and Boston
represented &quot;promi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.202" id="Page_iii.202">iii. 202</a></span>nent Democrats disgusted at Seymour and the
artifices of his friends.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Even Tammany, said the <i>Times</i>,
&quot;quailed at the prospect of entering upon a canvass with a leader
covered with personal dishonour, as Seymour had said himself he would
be, if he should accept. Men everywhere admit that such a nomination,
conferred under such circumstances, was not only pregnant with
disaster, but if accepted stained the recipient with personal
infamy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>Not since the Democratic party began holding national conventions had
the tactics practised at New York been equaled. The convention of 1844
must always be ranked as a masterpiece of manipulation, but its
diplomacy was played to defeat Van Buren rather than nominate a
candidate. In 1852 circumstances combined to prevent the nomination of
the convention's first or second choice, and in the end, as a
ball-player at the bat earns first base through the errors of a
pitcher, Franklin Pierce benefited. But in 1868 nothing was gained by
errors. Although there was a chief candidate to defeat, it was not
done with a bludgeon as in 1844. Nor were delegates allowed to
stampede to a &quot;dark horse&quot; as in 1852. On the contrary, while the
leading candidate suffered slow strangulation, the most conspicuous
man in the party was pushed to the front with a sagacity and firmness
that made men obey the dictates of a superior intelligence, and to
people who studied the ballots it plainly appeared that Samuel J.
Tilden had played the game.</p>

<p>Tilden had not sought prominence in the convention. He seldom spoke,
rarely figured in the meeting of delegates, and except to cast the
vote of the New York delegation did nothing to attract attention. But
the foresight exhibited in changing from Church to Hendricks on the
eighth ballot discovered a mind singularly skilled in controlling the
actions of men. The play appeared the more remarkable after the
revelation of its influence. New York did not want Hendricks. Besides,
up to that time, the Hoosier had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.203" id="Page_iii.203">iii. 203</a></span> less than forty votes, his
own State refusing to unite in his support. Moreover, since adjoining
States save Michigan warmly advocated Pendleton, all sources of growth
seemed closed to him. Yet Tilden's guiding hand, with infallible
sagacity, placed New York's thirty-three votes on Indiana and
absolutely refused to move them. To dispose of Hendricks, Vallandigham
and other Ohio delegates offered to support Chase, and if the chairman
of the New York delegation had led the way, a formidable coalition
must have carried the convention for the Chief Justice. But the man
whose subtile, mysterious influence was already beginning to be
recognised as a controlling factor in the party desired Seymour, and
to force his nomination he met at Delmonico's, on the evening of the
fourth day, Allen G. Thurman, George E. Pugh, Washington McLean,
George W. McCook, and George W. Morgan, Ohio's most influential
delegates, and there arranged the <i>coup d'&#233;tat</i> that succeeded so
admirably. This scheme remained a profound secret until the Ohio
delegation retired for consultation after the twenty-first ballot, so
that when Seymour was addressing the New York delegation in behalf of
Chase, Tilden knew of the pending master-stroke. &quot;The artful Tilden,&quot;
said Alexander Long, a well-known politician of the day, &quot;is a
candidate for the United States Senate, and he thinks that with
Seymour the Democrats can carry both branches of the New York
Legislature.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Tilden disclaimed all instrumentality in bringing about the
nomination. &quot;I had no agency,&quot; he wrote, &quot;in getting Governor Seymour
into his present scrape.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> He likewise professed ignorance as to
what the convention would do. &quot;I did not believe the event possible,&quot;
he said, &quot;unless Ohio demanded it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> This admission, frankly
conceding the necessity of Ohio's action which he had himself forced,
shattered the sincerity of Tilden's disclaimer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.204" id="Page_iii.204">iii. 204</a></span></p><p>Seymour also had difficulty in preserving the appearance of sincerity.
The press claimed that when he saw the nomination coming to him with
the approval of Pendleton's supporters he quickly retired instead of
further insisting upon his declination. This insinuation allied his
dramatic performance with Tilden's tactics, and he hesitated to expose
himself to such a compromising taunt. In this emergency Tilden
endeavoured very adroitly to ease his mind. &quot;My judgment is,&quot; he wrote
a mutual friend, &quot;that acceptance under present circumstances would
not compromise his repute for sincerity or be really misunderstood by
the people; that the case is not analogous to the former instances
which have made criticism possible; that the true nature of the
sacrifice should be appreciated, while on the other hand the opposite
course would be more likely to incite animadversion; that, on the
whole, acceptance is the best thing. I think a decision is necessary,
for it is not possible to go through a canvass with a candidate
declining. I am sincerely willing to accept such action as will be
most for the honour of our friend; at the same time my personal wish
is acceptance. You may express for me so much on the subject as you
find necessary and think proper.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>On August 4, when Seymour finally accepted, he neither apologised nor
explained. &quot;The nomination,&quot; he wrote, &quot;was unsought and unexpected. I
have been caught up by the overwhelming tide which is bearing us on to
a great political change, and I find myself unable to resist its
pressure.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Those who recalled the Governor's alleged tortuous
course at Chicago and again at Albany in 1864 did not credit him with
the candour that excites admiration. &quot;Such men did not believe in the
sincerity of Seymour's repeated declinations,&quot; said Henry J. Raymond,
&quot;and therefore accepted the final result with the significant remark,
'I told you so.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Horace Greeley was more severe. &quot;The means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.205" id="Page_iii.205">iii. 205</a></span> by
which Horatio Seymour obtained his nomination,&quot; he wrote, &quot;are
characteristic of that political cunning which has marked his career.
The whole affair was an adroit specimen of political hypocrisy, by
which the actual favourite of the majority was not only sold, but was
induced to nominate the trickster who had defeated him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>After Seymour's nomination the first expression of the campaign
occurred in Vermont. Although largely Republican the Democrats made an
unusually animated contest, sending their best speakers and furnishing
the needed funds. Nevertheless, the Republicans added 7,000 to their
majority of the preceding year. This decisive victory, celebrated in
Albany on September 2, had a depressing influence upon the Democratic
State convention then in session, ending among other things the
candidacy of Henry C. Murphy for governor. The up-State opponents of
the Tweed ring, joined by the Kings County delegation, hoped to make a
winning combination against John T. Hoffman, and for several days
Murphy stood up against the attacks of Tammany, defying its threats
and refusing to withdraw. But he wilted under the news from Vermont.
If not beaten in convention, he argued, defeat is likely to come in
the election, and so, amidst the noise of booming cannon and parading
Republicans, he allowed Hoffman to be nominated by acclamation.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>In the selection of a lieutenant-governor Tammany did not fare so
well. Boss Tweed, in return for Western support of Hoffman, had
declared for Albert P. Laning of Buf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.206" id="Page_iii.206">iii. 206</a></span>falo, and until District Attorney
Morris of Brooklyn seconded the nomination of another, Laning's
friends had boasted a large majority. Morris said he had no objection
to Laning personally. He simply opposed him as a conspirator who had
combined with Tammany to carry out the programme of a grasping clique.
He wished the country delegates who had unconsciously aided its
wire-pulling schemes to understand that it sought only its own
aggrandisement. It cared nothing for the Democratic party except as it
contributed to its selfish ends. This corrupt oligarchy, continued the
orator, his face flushed and his eyes flashing with anger, intends
through Hoffman to control the entire patronage of the State, and if
Seymour is elected it will grasp that of the whole country. Suppose
this offensive ring, with its unfinished courthouse and its thousand
other schemes of robbery and plunder, controls the political power of
the State and nation as it now dominates the metropolis, what honest
Democrat can charge corruption to the opposite party? Did men from the
interior of the State understand that Hoffman for governor means a
ring magnate for United Sates senator? That is the game, and if it
cannot be played by fair means, trickery and corruption will
accomplish it. Kings County, which understands the methods of this
clique, has not now and he hoped never would have anything in common
with it, and he warned the country members not to extend its wicked
sway.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Morris' speech anticipated the startling disclosures of 1871, and as
the orator raised his voice to a pitch that could easily be heard
throughout the hall, the up-State delegates became deeply interested
in his words. He did not deal in glittering generalities. He was a
prosecuting officer in a county adjoining Tammany, and when he
referred to the courthouse robbery he touched the spot that reeked
with corruption. The Ring winced, but remained speechless. Tweed and
his associate plunderers, who had spent three millions on the
courthouse and charged on their books an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.207" id="Page_iii.207">iii. 207</a></span> expenditure of eleven, had
no desire to stir up discussion on such a topic and be pilloried by a
cross-examination on the floor of the convention. A majority of the
delegates, however, convinced that Tammany must not control the
lieutenant-governor, nominated Allen C. Beach of Jefferson, giving him
77 votes to 47 for Laning.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>In the light of this result Murphy's friends seriously regretted his
hasty withdrawal from the contest. Morris intended arraigning Tammany
in his speech, nominating the Brooklyn Senator for governor, and the
latter's supporters believed that Hoffman, whom they recognised as the
personal representative of the Tweed ring, must have gone down under
the disclosures of the District Attorney quite as easily as did
Laning. This hasty opinion, however, did not have the support of
truth. Hoffman's campaign in 1866 strengthened him with the people of
the up-counties. To them he had a value of his own. In his speeches he
had denounced wrongs and rebuked corruption, and his record as mayor
displayed no disposition to enrich himself at the expense of his
reputation. He was careful at least to observe surface proprieties.
Besides, at this time, Tammany had not been convicted of crime.
Vitriolic attacks upon the Tweed Ring were frequent, but they came
from men whom it had hurt. Even Greeley's historic philippic, as
famous for its style as for its deadly venom, came in revenge for
Tweed's supposed part in defeating him for Congress in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<h2>THE STATE CARRIED BY FRAUD</h2>

<h2>1868</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Horatio Seymour&#8217;s</span> nomination for President worried his Republican
opponents in New York. It was admitted that he would adorn the great
office, and that if elected he could act with more authority and
independence than Chief Justice Chase, since the latter must have been
regarded by Congress as a renegade and distrusted by Democrats as a
radical. It was agreed, also, that the purity of Seymour's life, his
character for honesty in financial matters, and the high social
position which he held, made him an especially dangerous adversary in
a State that usually dominated a national election. On the other hand,
his opponents recalled that whenever a candidate for governor he had
not only run behind his ticket, but had suffered defeat three out of
five times. It was suggested, too, that although his whole public life
had been identified with the politics of the Commonwealth, his name,
unlike that of Daniel D. Tompkins, DeWitt Clinton, or Silas Wright,
was associated with no important measure of State policy. To this
criticism Seymour's supporters justly replied that as governor, in
1853, he had boldly championed the great loan of ten and one-half
millions for the Erie Canal enlargement.</p>

<p>As usual national issues controlled the campaign in New York. Although
both parties denounced corruption in the repair of the Erie Canal, the
people seemed more concerned in a return of good times and in a better
understanding between the North and South. The financial depression of
the year before had not disappeared, and an issue of greenbacks in
payment of the 5-20 bonds, it was argued, would over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.209" id="Page_iii.209">iii. 209</a></span>come the policy
of contraction which had enhanced the face value of debts and
decreased the price of property. Pendleton's tour through Maine
emphasised this phase of the financial question, and while Democrats
talked of &quot;The same currency for ploughboy and bondholder,&quot;
Republicans insisted upon &quot;The best currency for both ploughboy and
bondholder.&quot;</p>

<p>The campaign in Maine, however, satisfied Republicans that the
Southern question, forced into greater prominence by recent acts of
violence, had become a more important issue than the financial
problem. In Saint Mary's parish, Louisiana, a Republican sheriff and
judge were shot, editors and printers run out of the county, and their
newspaper offices destroyed. But no arrests followed. In Arkansas a
Republican deputy sheriff was tied to a negro and both killed with one
shot. In South Carolina a colored State senator, standing on the
platform of a street car, suffered the death penalty, his executioners
publicly boasting of their act. In Georgia negro members of the
Legislature were expelled. Indeed, from every Southern State came
reports of violence and murder. These stories were accentuated by the
Camilla riot in Georgia, which occurred on September 19. With banners
and music three hundred Republicans, mostly negroes, were marching to
Camilla to hold a mass meeting. Two-thirds of them carried arms.
Before reaching the town the sheriff endeavoured to persuade them to
lay aside their guns and revolvers, and upon their refusal a riot
ensued, in which eight or nine negroes were killed and twenty or
thirty wounded. As usual their assailants escaped arrest and injury.
General Meade, commander of the department, reported that &quot;the authors
of this outrage were civil officers who, under the guise of enforcing
the law and suppressing disorder, had permitted a wanton sacrifice of
life and blood.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>The mere recital of these incidents aroused Northern feeling. It was
the old story&#8212;murder without arrests or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.210" id="Page_iii.210">iii. 210</a></span> investigation. The
knowledge, too, that it was in part the work of the Ku-Klux-Klan, a
secret organisation pledged to disfranchise the negro by intimidation,
intensified the bitterness. It is probably true that many reported
atrocities were merely campaign stories. It is likely, too, that horse
thieves and illicit distillers screened their misdeeds behind the
Ku-Klux. It is well understood, also, that ambitious carpet-bag
agitators, proving bad instructors for negroes just emerging from
slavery, added largely to the list of casualties, making crime appear
general throughout the South. But whether violence was universal or
sporadic Republicans believed it a dangerous experiment to commit the
government to the hands of &quot;rebels and copperheads,&quot; and in their
contest to avoid such an alleged calamity they emphasised Southern
outrages and resurrected Seymour's speech to the draft rioters in
July, 1863. To give the latter fresh interest Nast published a cartoon
entitled &quot;Matched,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> which represented Grant demanding the
unconditional surrender of Vicksburg, while Seymour, addressing a mob
of foreigners wet with the blood of their victims, called them &quot;my
friends.&quot; Nast presented another cartoon which disturbed the
Democracy. It represented John T. Hoffman standing before a screen
behind which a gang of thieves was busily rifling the city treasury.
The face of Hoffman only was depicted, but the picture's serious note
of warning passed for more than a bit of campaign pleasantry. Frank P.
Blair, the Democratic candidate for Vice-President, also furnished a
text for bitter invective because of his declaration that &quot;there is
but one way to restore the government and the Constitution and that is
for the President-elect to declare the Reconstruction Acts null and
void, compel the army to undo its usurpations at the South, disperse
the carpet-bag State governments, allow the white people to reorganise
their own governments and elect senators and representatives.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Republicans charged that this represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.211" id="Page_iii.211">iii. 211</a></span> the Democratic policy. On
the other hand, the closing sentence of Grant's brief letter of
acceptance, &quot;Let us have peace,&quot; became the shibboleth of his
followers, who claimed that the courteous and deferential spirit shown
at Appomattox would characterise his administration. Indeed, the issue
finally resolved itself to &quot;Blair and Revolution&quot; or &quot;Grant and
Peace,&quot; and after a contest of unusual bitterness Republicans carried
the October States, although with greatly reduced majorities.
Pennsylvania gave only 10,000, Ohio 17,000, and Indiana less than
1,000.</p>

<p>Though these elections presaged a Republican victory in November,
Democrats, still hopeful of success, renewed their efforts with great
energy. Blair went to the rear and Seymour took the stump. With
studied moderation Seymour had written his letter of acceptance to
catch the wavering Republican voter. He made it appear that the South
was saved from anarchy by the military, and that the North, to the
sincere regret of many Republicans and their ablest journals, was no
longer controlled by the sober judgment of the dominant party's safest
leaders. &quot;There is hardly an able man who helped to build up the
Republican organisation,&quot; he said, &quot;who has not within the past three
years warned it against its excesses.&quot; These men he pictured as forced
to give up their sentiments or to abandon their party, arguing that
the latter's policy must be more violent in future unless checked by a
division of political power. &quot;Such a division,&quot; he said, adroitly
seeking to establish confidence in himself, &quot;tends to assure the peace
and good order of society. The election of a Democratic Executive and
a majority of Democratic members to the House of Representatives would
not give to that party organisation the power to make sudden or
violent changes, but it would serve to check those extreme measures
which have been deplored by the best men of both political
organisations.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Preaching this gospel of peace Seymour passed through Western New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.212" id="Page_iii.212">iii. 212</a></span> Illinois, attempting to
overcome the prestige of Grant's great fame, and to stem the tide of
Northern prejudice against Southern outrages. Meanwhile Roscoe
Conkling, having returned from a pleasure trip to Denver, entered the
campaign with earnestness against his brother-in-law. He desired
especially to carry Oneida County, to which he devoted his energies in
the closing days of the contest, making a schoolhouse canvass that
lifted the issue above local pride in its distinguished citizen who
headed the Democratic ticket. In going the rounds he met &quot;Black
Paddy,&quot; a swarthy Irishman and local celebrity, who announced that he
had &quot;turned Democrat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How so?&quot; asked the Senator.</p>

<p>&quot;Shure, sir,&quot; replied the quick-witted Celt, &quot;O'im payin' ye a
compliment in votin' for your brother-in-law.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Near the close of the campaign, in accordance with the habit of many
years, William H. Seward returned to Auburn to speak to his neighbors
and townsmen. No one then realised that this was to be his last
political meeting, or that before another presidential election
occurred he would have entered upon his long sleep on Fort Hill. But
the hall was as full as if it had been so advertised. He was neither
an old man, being sixty-seven, nor materially changed in appearance.
Perhaps his face was a trifle thinner, his hair lighter, and his jaw
more prominent, but his mental equipment survived as in the olden days
when the splendid diction hit the tone and temper of the anti-slavery
hosts. His speech, however, showed neither the spirit that nerved him
in the earlier time, nor the resources that formerly sustained him in
vigorous and persuasive argument. He spoke rather in a vein of
extenuation and reminiscence, as one whose work, judged by its
beginnings, had perhaps ended unsatisfactorily as well as illogically,
and for which there was no sufficient reason.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>This speech had the effect of widening the breach between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.213" id="Page_iii.213">iii. 213</a></span> him and his
old associates, who bitterly resented his apparent indifference in the
great contest, while men of a younger generation, looking at him with
wonder and interest, found it hard to realise that he had been one of
the most conspicuous and energetic figures in political life. How
complete was the loss of his political influence is na&#239;vely
illustrated by Andrew D. White. &quot;Mr. Cornell and I were arranging a
programme for the approaching annual commencement when I suggested Mr.
Seward for the main address. Mr. Cornell had been one of Mr. Seward's
lifelong supporters, but he received this proposal coldly, pondered it
for a few moments silently, and then said dryly: 'Perhaps you are
right, but if you call him you will show to our students the deadest
man that ain't buried in the State of New York.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Samuel J. Tilden voiced the supreme ante-election confidence of the
Democrats. &quot;Speaking from an experience of more than thirty years in
political observation and political action,&quot; he said, &quot;I do not
hesitate to say that in no presidential conflict since the days of
Andrew Jackson have omens of victory to any party or any cause been so
clear, so numerous, and so inspiring as those which now cheer the
party of the national Democracy to battle in the cause of American
liberty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The victory of 1867, in the opinion of leading
Democrats, had removed the Empire State from the doubtful list, but
while proclaiming their confidence of success many of them knew that a
confidential circular, issued from the rooms of the Democratic State
Committee and bearing the signature of Samuel J. Tilden, instructed
certain persons in each of the up-State counties to telegraph William
M. Tweed, &quot;the minute the polls close and at his expense,&quot; the
probable Republican majority.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Its purpose was plain. The
conspirators desired to know how many fraudulent votes would be needed
to overcome the Republi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.214" id="Page_iii.214">iii. 214</a></span>can superiority, and their method, then novel
and ingenious, avoided all chance of failure to carry the State.
Tilden denied knowledge of this circular. He also disclaimed its evil
purpose, but preferred to remain silent rather than denounce the
forgers.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Forewarned by the returns of 1867 Griswold's supporters, fearing fraud
in the metropolis, invoked the aid of the United States Court to
prevent the use of forged naturalisation papers, which resulted in the
indictment of several men and the publication of fraudulent registry
lists. Against such action John T. Hoffman, as mayor, violently
protested. &quot;We are on the eve of an important election,&quot; said his
proclamation. &quot;Intense excitement pervades the whole community.
Unscrupulous, designing, and dangerous men, political partisans, are
resorting to extraordinary means to increase it. Gross and unfounded
charges of fraud are made by them against those high in authority.
Threats are made against naturalised citizens, and a federal grand
jury has been induced to find, in great haste and secrecy, bills of
indictment for the purpose, openly avowed, of intimidating them in the
discharge of their public duties.... Let no citizen, however, be
deterred by any threats or fears, but let him assert his rights boldly
and resolutely, and he will find his perfect protection under the laws
and the lawfully constituted authorities of the State. By virtue of
authority invested in me I hereby offer a reward of $100 to be paid on
the arrest and conviction of any person charged ... with intimidating,
obstructing or defrauding any voter in the exercise of his right as an
elector.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Thus did the Tweed Ring strike back.</p>

<p>The result of the election in the country at large deeply disappointed
the Democrats. Grant obtained 214 electoral votes in twenty-six
States, while Seymour secured 80 in eight States. In New York,
however, the conspirators did their word well. Although the
Republicans won a majority in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.215" id="Page_iii.215">iii. 215</a></span> both branches of the Legislature and
elected eighteen of the thirty-one congressmen, Seymour carried the
State by 10,000 and Hoffman by 27,946.</p>

<p>After the election the Union League Club charged that in New York City
false naturalisation and fraudulent voting had been practised upon a
gigantic scale. It appeared from its report that one man sold seven
thousand fraudulent naturalisation certificates; that thousands of
fictitious names, with false residences attached, were enrolled, and
that gangs of repeaters marched from poll to poll, voting many times
in succession. The <i>Tribune</i> showed that in twenty election districts
the vote cast for Hoffman largely exceeded the registry lists, already
heavily padded with fictitious names, and that by comparison with
other years the aggregate State vote clearly revealed the work of the
conspirators.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Instead of being the choice of the people, it said,
&quot;Hoffman was 'elected' by the most infamous system of fraud.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
Andrew D. White wrote that &quot;the gigantic frauds perpetrated in the
sinks and dens of the great city have overborne the truthful vote and
voice of the Empire State. The country knows this, and the Democratic
party, flushed with a victory which fraud has won, hardly cares to
deny it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> A few months later Conkling spoke of it as a well known
fact that John T. Hoffman was counted in. &quot;The election was a
barbarous burlesque,&quot; he continued. &quot;Many thousand forged
naturalisation papers were issued; some of them were white and some
were coffee-coloured. The same witnesses purported to attest hundreds
and thousands of naturalisation affidavits, and the stupendous fraud
of the whole thing was and is an open secret.... Repeating, ballot-box
stuffing, ruffianism, and false counting decided everything. Tweed
made the election officers, and the election officers were corrupt.
Thirty thousand votes were falsely added to the Democratic majority in
New York and Brooklyn alone. Taxes and elections were the mere spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.216" id="Page_iii.216">iii. 216</a></span>
and booty of a corrupt junta in Tammany. Usurpation and fraud
inaugurated a carnival of corrupt disorder; and obscene birds without
number swooped down to the harvest and gorged themselves on every side
in plunder and spoliation.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>When Congress convened a committee, appointed to investigate
naturalisation frauds in the city of New York, reported that prior to
1868 the Common Pleas and Superior Courts, controlling matters of
naturalisation, annually averaged, from 1856 to 1867, 9,000 new
voters, but that after the Supreme Court began making citizens on
October 6, 1868, the number rapidly increased to 41,112. Several
revelations added interest to this statement. Judge Daly served in the
Common Pleas, while McCunn, Barnard, Cardozo, and others whom Tweed
controlled, sat in the Supreme and Superior Courts. Daly required from
three to five minutes to examine an applicant, but McCunn boasted that
he could do it in thirty seconds, with the result that the Supreme
Court naturalised from 1,800 to 2,100 per day, whereas the Common
Pleas during the entire year acted upon only 3,140. On the other hand,
the Supreme and Superior Courts turned out 37,967. &quot;One day last week
one of our 'upright judges,'&quot; said the <i>Nation</i>, &quot;invited a friend to
sit by him while he played a little joke. Then he left off calling
from the list before him and proceeded to call purely imaginary names
invented by himself on the spur of the moment: John Smith, James
Snooks, Thomas Noakes, and the like. For every name a man instantly
answered and took a certificate. Finally, seeing a person scratching
his head, the judge called out, 'George Scratchem!' 'Here,' responded
a voice. 'Take that man outside to scratch,' said his honour to an
usher, and resumed the more regular manufacture of voters.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>To show that a conspiracy existed to commit fraud, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.217" id="Page_iii.217">iii. 217</a></span> committee
submitted valuable evidence contributed by the clerks of these courts.
Instead of printing the usual number of blank certificates based on
the annual average of 9,000, they ordered, between September 16 and
October 23, more than seven times as many, or 69,000, of which 39,000
went to the Supreme Court. As this court had just gone into the
naturalisation business the order seemed suspiciously large. At the
time of the investigation 27,068 of these certificates were
unaccounted for, and the court refused an examination of its records.
However, by showing that the vote cast in 1868, estimated upon the
average rate of the increase of voters, should have been 131,000
instead of 156,000, the committee practically accounted for them. The
<i>Nation</i> unwittingly strengthened this measured extent of the fraud,
declaring on the day the courts finished their work, that of &quot;the
35,000 voters naturalised in this city alone, 10,000 are perhaps
rightly admitted, 10,000 have passed through the machine without
having been here five years, and the other 15,000 have never been near
the courtroom.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> A table also published by the committee showed
the ratio of votes to the population at each of the five preceding
presidential elections to have been 1 to 8, while in 1868 it was 1 to
4.65. &quot;The only fair conclusion from these facts would be,&quot; said the
<i>Nation</i>, &quot;that enormous frauds were perpetrated.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the Democratic minority of the committee, after
examining Hoffman and Tweed, who disclaimed any knowledge of the
transactions and affected to disbelieve the truth of the charges,
pronounced the facts cited &quot;stale slanders,&quot; and most of the witnesses
&quot;notorious swindlers, liars, and thieves,&quot; declaring that the
fraudulent vote did not exceed 2,000, divided equally between the two
parties. Moreover, it pronounced the investigation a shameful effort
to convict the Democracy of crimes that were really the result of the
long-continued misgovernment of the Republicans. If that party
controlled the city, declared one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.218" id="Page_iii.218">iii. 218</a></span> critic, it would become as adept in
&quot;repeating&quot; as it was in &quot;gerrymandering&quot; the State, whose Legislature
could not be carried by the Democrats when their popular majority
exceeded 48,000 as in 1867. This sarcastic thrust emphasised the
notorious gerrymander which, in spite of the Tammany frauds, gave the
Republicans a legislative majority of twenty-four on joint-ballot.</p>

<h2>INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN SENATORIAL ELECTIONS</h2>

<h2>1869</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> election of a legislative majority in 1868 plunged the Republicans
into a fierce contest over the choice of a successor to Edwin D.
Morgan, whose term in the United States Senate ended on March 4. In
bitterness it resembled the historic battle between Weed and Greeley
in 1861. Morgan had made several mistakes. His support of Johnson
during the first year of the latter's Administration discredited him,
and although he diligently laboured to avoid all remembrance of it,
the patronage which the President freely gave had continued to
identify him with the Johnsonised federal officials. To overcome this
distrust he presented letters from Sumner and Wade, testifying to his
loyalty to the more radical element of the party.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> A revival of
the story of his opposition to Wadsworth in 1862 also embarrassed him.
He had overcome it when first elected to the Senate by the sustaining
hand of Thurlow Weed, whose position in the management of the party
was strengthened by Wadsworth's defeat; but now Weed was absent, and
to aid in meeting the ugly charges which rendered his way devious and
difficult, Morgan had recourse to Edwin M. Stanton, who wrote that
Wadsworth, distinguishing the Senator from his betrayers, repeatedly
spoke of him as a true friend and faithful supporter.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Morgan's strength, though of a negative kind, had its head concealed
under the coils of Conkling's position. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.220" id="Page_iii.220">iii. 220</a></span> manifest that the
latter's admirers were combining to depose Reuben E. Fenton, Morgan's
chief competitor for the senatorial toga. Chester A. Arthur, looking
into the future, had already recognised the need of a new alignment,
and the young Senator evidenced the qualities that appealed to him.
There was a common impression that if Morgan were re-elected, he would
yield to the greater gifts of Conkling and the purpose, now so
apparent, was to crush Fenton and make Conkling the head of an
organisation which should include both Senators. John A. Griswold
understood this and declined to embarrass Morgan by entering the race.</p>

<p>Fenton at this time was at the height of his power. His lieutenants,
headed by Waldo M. Hutchins, the distributor of his patronage,
excelled in the gifts of strategy, which had been illustrated in the
election of Truman G. Younglove for speaker. They were dominated,
also, by the favourite doctrine of political leaders that organisation
must be maintained and victory won at any cost save by a revolution in
party policy, and they entered the senatorial contest with a courage
as sublime as it was relentless. Their chief, too, possessed the
confidence of the party. His radicalism needed no sponsors. Besides,
his four years' service as governor, strengthened by the veto of
several bills calculated to increase the public burdens, had received
the unmistakable approval of the people.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was heavily handicapped. Greeley, still smarting under
Fenton's failure to support him for governor in 1868, declared for
Marshall O. Roberts, while Noah Davis, surprised at his insincerity,
aided Morgan. If Greeley's grievance had merit, Davis' resentment was
certainly justified. The latter claimed that after Conkling's election
in 1867, Fenton promised to support him in 1869, and that upon the
Governor's advice, to avoid the prejudice against a judge who engaged
in politics, he had resigned from the Supreme Court and made a winning
race for Congress.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.221" id="Page_iii.221">iii. 221</a></span></p>
<p>But the <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>, a journal then conducted by
Conservatives, placed the most serious obstacle in Fenton's pathway,
charging that an intimate friend of the Governor had received $10,000
on two occasions after the latter had approved bills for the New York
Dry Dock and the Erie Railroad Companies.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Although the <i>Sun</i>
promptly pronounced it &quot;a remarkable piece of vituperation,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and
the <i>Tribune</i>, declaring &quot;its source of no account,&quot; called it &quot;a most
scurrilous diatribe,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> the leading Democratic journal of the State
accepted it as &quot;true.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The story was not new. In the preceding
summer, during an investigation into the alleged bribery of members of
the Legislature of 1868, Henry Thompson, an Erie director, was asked
if his company paid Governor Fenton any money for approving the bill
legalising the acts of its directors in the famous &quot;Erie war.&quot;
Thompson refused to answer as the question fell without the scope of
the committee's jurisdiction. Thereupon Thomas Murphy testified that
Thompson told him that he saw two checks of $10,000 each paid to
Hamilton Harris, the Governor's legal adviser, under an agreement that
Fenton should sign the bill. Murphy added that afterwards, as chairman
of a Republican political committee, he asked Jay Gould, president of
the Erie company, for a campaign contribution, and was refused for the
reason that he had already given $20,000 for Fenton. Harris and Gould
knew nothing of the transaction.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Matthew Hale, chairman of the Senate investigating committee, did not
include this testimony in his report, and the startling and improbable
publication in the <i>Commercial Advertiser</i> must have withered as the
sensation of a day, had not the belief obtained that the use of money
in senatorial contests played a prominent and important part. This
scandalous practice was modern. Until 1863 nothing had been heard of
the use of money in such contests. But what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.222" id="Page_iii.222">iii. 222</a></span> then whispered, and
openly talked about in 1867 as Conkling testified, now became a common
topic of conversation. &quot;It is conceded on all hands,&quot; said the
<i>Times</i>, editorially, &quot;that money will decide the contest.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Talk of this kind appealed to the pessimist who believes a legislator
is always for sale, but Speaker Younglove, an assemblyman of long
experience, knowing that good committee appointments were more potent
than other influences, tactfully withheld the announcement of his
committees. Such a proceeding had never before occurred in the history
of the State, and twelve years later, when George H. Sharpe resorted
to the same tactics, William B. Woodin declared that it made Younglove
&quot;a political corpse.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Nevertheless, Morgan soon understood that
chairmanships and assignments on great committees were vastly more
attractive than anything he had to offer, and on January 16 (1869) the
first ballot of the caucus gave Fenton 52 votes to 40 for Morgan. A
month later, Richard M. Blatchford, then a justice of the United
States Supreme Court, wrote Thurlow Weed: &quot;Morgan loses his election
because, you being sick, his backbone was missing.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<h2>TWEED CONTROLS THE STATE</h2>

<h2>1869-70</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">William M. Tweed</span> had become a State senator in 1867. At this time he
held seventeen city offices.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> But one more place did not embarrass
him, and in entering upon his new career he promptly invoked the
tactics that strengthened him in the metropolis. Through the influence
of a Republican colleague on the Board of Supervisors he secured
appointments upon the important committees of Finance and Internal
Affairs, the first passing upon all appropriations, and the second
controlling most of the subordinate legislation in the State including
Excise measures. This opportunity for reviewing general legislation
gave him the advantage of a hawk circling in the sky of missing no
chance for plunder. By means of generous hospitality and a natural
affability he quickly won the esteem of his fellow senators, many of
whom responded to his gentle suggestion of city clerkships for
constituents. In his pretended zeal to serve Republicans he had
offered, during the recent contest for United States senator, to
marshal the Democrats to the support of Charles J. Folger, the leader
of the Senate, provided two Republican senators and twelve assemblymen
would vote for him.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Persons familiar with Tweed's true character
understood that a senator of Folger's integrity and ability would be
less in the way at Washington than in Albany, but his apparent desire
to help the Genevan did him no harm.</p>

<p>Thus intrenched in the good will of his colleagues Tweed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.224" id="Page_iii.224">iii. 224</a></span> early in
the session, began debauching the tax levies for the city and county
of New York. His party controlled the Assembly, and his henchman,
William Hitchman, whom he had made speaker, controlled its committees.
What the Senate did, therefore, would be approved in the House. The
tax levies contained items of expense based upon estimates by the
different departments of the municipal and county governments. They
were prepared by the comptroller, examined by the city council and
county supervisors respectively, and submitted to the Legislature for
its approval. In the process they might be swelled by the comptroller
and the two boards, but the Legislature, acting as an outside and
disinterested party, usually trimmed them. Tweed, however, proposed to
swell them again. Accordingly projects for public improvements,
asylums, hospitals, and dispensaries that never existed except on
paper, appeared as beneficiaries of county and city. The comptroller
concealed these thefts by the issue of stocks and bonds and the
creation of a floating debt, which formed no part of his
statements.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> When the committee on appropriations reported these
additions, &quot;the increase,&quot; it was claimed in the progress of the
discussion, &quot;was called for only by plunderers.&quot;</p>

<p>The passage of these vicious appropriations, requiring the help of
Republicans, gave rise to numerous charges of bribery and corruption.
&quot;It was fully believed here,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>, &quot;that tax levies
supplied the means for fabricating naturalisation papers and hiring
repeaters whereby Republicans were swindled out of the vote of this
State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Other corrupt practices in connection with important
railroad legislation, having special reference to the passage of the
so-called &quot;Erie Bill,&quot; likewise attracted public attention. But
Matthew Hale's investigating committee, after a long and fruitless
session in the summer of 1868, expressed the opinion that the crime of
bribery could not be proven under the law as it then existed, since
both parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.225" id="Page_iii.225">iii. 225</a></span> to the transaction were liable to punishment. This led
to a new statute exempting from prosecution the giver of a bribe which
was accepted.</p>

<p>However, the Legislature elected in November, 1868, proved no less
plastic in the hands of the Boss, who again corrupted the tax levies.
After allowing every just item the committee coolly added six
millions,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> an amount subsequently reduced to three.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> This
iniquity was immediately denounced and exposed through pamphlets,
journals, and debates. Men frankly admitted that no reason or economic
principle justified the existence of such monstrous levies. Indeed,
every honest influence, legal, social, and political, opposed it. The
press condemned it, good men mourned over it, and wise men unmasked
it. But with the help of twenty Republicans, backed by the approval of
John T. Hoffman, the bill became a law. This time, however,
indignation did not die with the Legislature. The <i>Tribune</i>, charging
that the twenty Republican assemblymen whose names it published were
&quot;bought and paid with cash stolen by means of tax levies,&quot; insisted
that &quot;the rascals&quot; should not be renominated. &quot;We firmly believe,&quot; it
added, &quot;that no Republican voted for these levies except for pay ...
and we say distinctly that we do not want victory this fall if it is
to be in all respects like the victory of last fall.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>Local party leaders, resenting the <i>Tribune's</i> declarations, packed
conventions, renominated the black-listed legislators, and spread such
demoralisation that George William Curtis, Thomas Hillhouse, and John
C. Robinson withdrew from the State ticket. As a punishment for his
course the State Committee, having little faith in the election of its
candidates, substituted Horace Greeley for comptroller in place of
Hillhouse.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> In accepting the nomination Greeley ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.226" id="Page_iii.226">iii. 226</a></span>pressed the
hope that it never would be said of him that he asked for an office,
or declined an honourable service to which he was called.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>If corruption had demoralised Republicans, fear of a repetition of the
Tweed frauds paralysed them. The plan of having counties telegraph the
votes needed to overcome an up-State majority could be worked again as
successfully as before, since the machinery existed and the men were
more dexterous. Besides, danger of legal punishment had disappeared.
The Union League Club had established nothing, the congressional
investigation had resulted in no one's arrest, and Matthew Hale's
committee had found existing law insufficient. Moreover, Hale had
reported that newspaper charges were based simply upon rumours
unsupported by proof.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Tweed understood all this, and his confidence whetted an ambition to
control the State as absolutely as he did the city. At the Syracuse
convention which assembled in September (1869) Tilden represented the
only influence that could be vitalised into organised opposition.
Tilden undoubtedly despised Tweed. Yet he gave him countenance and
saved the State chairmanship.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.227" id="Page_iii.227">iii. 227</a></span></p>
<p>The campaign pivoted on the acceptance or rejection of the new State
constitution, framed by the convention of 1867 and submitted by the
Legislature of 1869. From the first the constitutional convention had
become a political body. Republicans controlled it, and their
insistence upon unrestricted negro suffrage gave colour to the whole
document, until the Democrats, demanding its defeat, focused upon it
their united opposition. As a candidate for comptroller Horace Greeley
likewise became an issue. Democrats could not forget his impatient,
petulant, and, as they declared, unfair charges of election frauds,
and every satirist made merry at his expense. To denunciation and
abuse, however, Greeley paid no attention. &quot;They shall be most welcome
to vote against me if they will evince unabated devotion to the cause
of impartial suffrage.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> But the people, tired of Republican rule,
turned the State over to the Democrats regardless of men.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>Although this result was not unexpected, no one dreamed that the
Democracy would win every department of the State government,
executive, legislative, and judicial. For seventeen years the
Democrats had twice elected the governor and once secured the
Assembly, while the Republicans, holding the Senate continuously and
the governorship and Assembly most of the time, had come to regard
themselves the people's lawmakers and the representatives of executive
authority. But Tweed's quiet canvass in the southern tier of counties
traversed by the Erie Railroad exhibited rare cunning in the capture
of the State Senate. Until this fortress of Republican opposition
surrendered, Hoffman's appointments, like those of Seward in 1839,
could not be confirmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.228" id="Page_iii.228">iii. 228</a></span></p>

<p>After this election William M. Tweed's supremacy was acknowledged. In
1867 he had captured the Assembly and elected most of the State
officials; in 1868, after forcing the nomination of John T. Hoffman,
he made him governor by a system of gigantic frauds; and now in 1869,
having employed similar tactics in the southern tier of counties, he
had carried the Senate by four majority, secured the Assembly by
sixteen, and for the third time elected the State officials. This made
him leader of the State Democracy. Seymour so understood it, and
Tilden knew that he existed only as a figure-head.</p>

<p>Tweed's power became more apparent after the Legislature opened in
January, 1870. He again controlled the Assembly committees through
William Hitchman, his speaker; he arranged them to his liking in the
Senate through Allen C. Beach, the lieutenant-governor; and he
sweetened a majority of the members in both houses with substantial
hopes of large rewards. This defeated an organisation, called the
Young Democracy, which hoped to break his power by the passage of a
measure known as the Huckleberry Charter, transferring the duties of
State commissions to the Board of Aldermen. Then Tweed appeared with a
charter. Sweeny was its author and home-rule its alleged object. It
substituted for metropolitan commissions, devised and fostered by
Republicans, municipal departments charged with equivalent duties,
whose heads were appointed by the mayor. It also created a department
of docks, and merged the election of city and state officials. Its
crowning audacity, however, was the substitution of a superintendent
of public works for street commissioner, to be appointed by the mayor
for a term of four years, and to be removable only after an
impeachment trial, in which the entire six judges of the Common Pleas
Court must participate. It was apparent that this charter perpetuated
whatever was most feared in the system of commissions, and obliterated
all trace of the corrective. It was obvious, also, that by placing
officials beyond the reach of everybody interested in their good
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.229" id="Page_iii.229">iii. 229</a></span>haviour except the Courts, whose aid could be invoked only by the
mayor, and by him only for the extreme offense of malfeasance, it gave
a firmer hold to a Ring actuated by the resolute determination to
enrich itself at the public expense.</p>

<p>Yet this measure encountered little opposition. The Young Democracy,
backed by Tilden and the remnant of the Albany Regency, exposed its
dangerous features, the <i>Times</i> called it an &quot;abominable
charter,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> and Manton Marble bitterly denounced it. But Tweed
raised no flag of truce, and after the distribution of a million of
dollars the Sweeny charter had an easy passage through both houses,
the Senate recording but two votes against it and the Assembly only
five.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> It was said that five Republican senators received $40,000
each, and six others $10,000 each. Six hundred thousand went to a
lobbyist to buy assemblymen.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Within three days after its passage
(April 5) the Governor had approved it, the Mayor had appointed Tweed
to the position of most power, and Sweeny had taken the place of most
lucre. Thereafter, as commissioner of public works, the Boss was to be
&quot;the bold burglar,&quot; and his silent partner &quot;the dark plotter.&quot; A week
later the departments of police and health, the office of comptroller,
the park commission, and the great law bureau had passed into the
control of their pals, with Connolly as &quot;sneak-thief&quot; and Hall &quot;the
dashing bandit of the gang.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Indeed, a month had scarcely elapsed
before the <i>ad interim</i> Board of Audit, authorised by the Legislature
as an additional scheme for theft, and composed of Tweed, Hall, and
Connolly, had ordered the payment of $6,000,000, and within the year,
as subsequent revelations disclosed, its bills aggregated $12,250,000,
of which 66 per cent. went to the thieves.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.230" id="Page_iii.230">iii. 230</a></span></p><p>John T. Hoffman approved Tweed's measures. During the earlier months
of his gubernatorial career his veto of several bills granting aid to
railroads gave promise of independence, but after Tweed and Sweeny
became directors of the Erie he approved the measure enabling corrupt
operators to retain possession of the road for an indefinite period in
defiance of the stockholders. It is probable that the real character
and fatal tendency of his associates had not been revealed to him.
Nevertheless, ambition seems to have blunted a strong, alert mind. The
appointment of Ingraham, Cardozo, and Barnard to the General Term of
the Supreme Court within the city of New York, if further evidence
were needed, revealed the Governor's subserviency. To avoid the Tweed
judges as well as interruption to the business of the Courts, the Bar
Association asked the Executive to designate outside judges. Tweed
understood the real object, and before the lawyers' committee,
consisting of Charles O'Conor, Joseph H. Choate, Henry Nicoll, William
H. Peckham, and William E. Curtis, could reach Albany, the Governor,
under telegraphic instructions from the Boss, appointed the notorious
trio. Such revelations of weakness plunged the <i>Evening Post</i> and
other admirers into tribulation. &quot;The moral of Hoffman's fall,&quot; said
the <i>Nation</i>, &quot;is that respectable citizens must give up the notion
that good can be accomplished by patting anybody on the back who,
having got by accident or intrigue into high official position, treats
them to a few spasms of virtue and independence.... Had Hoffman held
out against the Erie Ring he would have had no chance of renomination,
all hope of the Presidency would be gone, and he would find himself
ostracised by his Democratic associates.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>Hoffman knew this as well as the <i>Nation</i>, and his obedience made him
the favourite of the Democratic State convention which assembled at
Rochester on September 21, 1870. It was a Tweed body. When he nodded
the delegates became unanimous. Tilden called it to order and had his
pocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.231" id="Page_iii.231">iii. 231</a></span> picked by a gentleman in attendance.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> &quot;We hope he has a
realising sense of the company he keeps,&quot; said the <i>Nation</i>, &quot;when he
opens conventions for Mr. Tweed, Mr. Hall, and Mr. Sweeny.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> A
week later it expressed the opinion that &quot;Tilden's appearance ought to
be the last exhibition the country is to witness of the alliance of
decent men for any purpose with these wretched thieves and
swindlers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> The plundering Boss denied so much as a hearing to
the Young Democracy whom Tilden encouraged, while their delegates,
without vote or voice or seat, witnessed the renomination of Hoffman
by acclamation, and saw the programme, drafted by Tweed, executed with
unanimity. Mighty was Tammany, and, mightier still, its Tweed! The
Rochester authorities urged the departure of the delegates before
dark, and upon their arrival at Jersey City the next morning the local
police made indiscriminate arrests and locked up large batches of
them, including a Commissioner of Charities and Correction.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<h2>CONKLING DEFEATS FENTON</h2>

<h2>1870</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Republican State convention which assembled at Saratoga on
September 7 was not so harmonious as the Tammany body. For several
years Senator Morgan and Governor Fenton had represented the two
sections of the party, the latter, soon after his inauguration on
January 1, 1865, having commenced building his political machine. As
an organiser he had few equals. One writer declares him &quot;the ablest
after Van Buren.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> At all events he soon became the head of the
party, controlling its conventions and distributing its patronage.
After entering the Senate he paid assiduous attention to the
President. The repeal of the Tenure-of-Office Act and an effort to
secure the confirmation of Alexander T. Stewart for secretary of the
treasury opened the way to Grant's heart, and for these and other
favours he received the lion's share of appointments. In the meantime
his opponents insisted that under cover of loud radical professions he
had relied wholly upon trickery for success, banning able men and
demoralising the party.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>To these criticisms and Conkling's advances the President presented a
listening ear. Conkling had not thrust himself upon Grant, but the
more the President tired of Fenton's importunities, the more he liked
Conkling's wit and sarcasm and forceful speech. As patronage gradually
disappeared Fenton redoubled his efforts to retain it, until in his
desperation he addressed a letter to the Chief Executive, referring to
his own presidential aspirations, and offering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.233" id="Page_iii.233">iii. 233</a></span> withdraw and give
him New York if the question of offices could be satisfactorily
arranged.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> This ended their relations.</p>

<p>Subsequent appointments, however, did not meet with more favour.
Fenton declared them fatal to party harmony, since some of the new
officials, besides holding confidential relations with Tammany, had
been friendly to the Philadelphia movement in 1866 and to Hoffman in
1868. Bitter criticism especially followed the nomination of Thomas
Murphy for collector of New York in place of Moses H. Grinnell. &quot;The
President appointed Murphy without consulting either Senator,&quot; says
Stewart, for thirty years a senator from Nevada. &quot;Grant met him at
Long Branch, and being thoroughly acquainted with the country and
quite a horseman he made himself such a serviceable friend that the
Chief Executive thought him a fit person for collector.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The New
York <i>Times</i> said, &quot;the President has taken a step which all his
enemies will exult over and his friends deplore.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> The <i>Tribune</i>
was more severe. &quot;The objection is not that he belongs to a particular
wing of the Republican party,&quot; it said, &quot;but that he does not honestly
belong to any; that his political record is one of treachery well
rewarded; his business record such that the merchants of New York have
no confidence in him; and the record of his relations to the
government such that, until cleared up, he ought to hold no place of
trust under it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Yet Murphy bore endorsements from men of the
highest respectability. &quot;Of those who in writing recommended his
appointment or confirmation,&quot; said Conkling, &quot;are Edwin D. Morgan,
George Opdyke, Henry Clews, John A. Griswold, Charles J. Folger,
Matthew Hale, George Dawson, and others. Their signatures are in my
possession.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Conkling preferred another, and until urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.234" id="Page_iii.234">iii. 234</a></span> by his
friend Stewart to secure Murphy's confirmation &quot;to avoid the possible
appointment of a less deserving man,&quot; he hesitated to act. &quot;I told him
that the struggle to confirm Murphy would enlighten the President as
to the political situation in New York, and that he would undoubtedly
accord him the influence to which he was entitled. Then, to force the
fight, Conkling, at my suggestion, objected to further
postponement.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The contest came on July 11, 1870.</p>

<p>Fenton recalled Murphy's malodorous army contracts, spoke of his
disloyalty to the party while a member of the State Senate, submitted
proof of his unscrupulous business relations with the leaders of
Tammany, and denounced his political treachery in the gubernatorial
contest of 1866. In this fierce three hours' arraignment the Senator
spared no one. He charged that Charles J. Folger and Chester A. Arthur
had appeared in Washington in Murphy's behalf, because to the latter's
potent and corrupt influence with Tammany, Folger owed his election to
the Court of Appeals in the preceding May,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> while Arthur, through
Murphy's unclean bargaining with Tweed, was fattening as counsel for
the New York City Tax Commission.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>In his reply Conkling spoke for an hour in his most vigorous style.
&quot;Every sentence,&quot; said Stewart, &quot;was replete with logic, sarcasm,
reason, and invective. Sometimes the senators would rise to their
feet, so great was the effect upon them. Toward the conclusion of his
speech Conkling walked down the aisle to a point opposite the seat of
Fenton. 'It is true,' he said, 'that Thomas Murphy is a mechanic, a
hatter by trade; that he worked at his trade in Albany supporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.235" id="Page_iii.235">iii. 235</a></span> an
aged father and mother and crippled brother, and that while thus
engaged another visited Albany and played a very different r&#244;le.' At
this point he drew from his pocket a court record, and extending it
toward Fenton, he continued,&#8212;'the particulars of which I will not
relate except at the special request of my colleague.' Fenton's head
dropped upon his desk as if struck down with a club. The scene in the
Senate was tragic.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>It was a desperate battle. For several weeks heated politicians, with
pockets full of affidavits, had hurried to Washington from all parts
of New York, and while it was admitted that the appointee was not a
shining credit to his backers, the belief obtained that the control of
the party in the State depended upon the result. The two Senators so
understood it, and their preparation for the contest omitted all
amenities. Fenton, regardless of whom he hit, relied upon carefully
drawn charges sustained by affidavits; Conkling trusted to a fire of
scathing sarcasm, supported by personal influence with his Democratic
colleagues and the President's power in his own party. The result
showed the senior Senator's shrewdness, for when he ceased talking the
Senate, by a vote of 48 to 3, confirmed the appointment.</p>

<p>From Washington the contest was transferred to Saratoga. Fenton,
desiring to impress and coerce the appointing power, made a herculean
effort to show that although Conkling had the ear of the President, he
could control the convention, and his plan included the election of
Charles H. Van Wyck for temporary chairman and himself for permanent
president. No doubt existed that at this moment he possessed great
power. Delegates crowded his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.236" id="Page_iii.236">iii. 236</a></span>quarters, and a score of lieutenants
reported him far in the lead. From Fenton's accession to the
governorship a majority of the State Committee had supported him,
while chairmen, secretaries, and inspectors of the Republican district
organisations in New York City, many of whom held municipal
appointments under Tweed, had been welded together in the interest of
the Chautauquan's ascendency. To try to break such a combine was
almost attempting the impossible. Indeed, until the President, in a
letter dated August 22, expressed the wish that Conkling might go as a
delegate, the Senator had hesitated to attend the convention.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
Even on the eve of its meeting he counselled with friends on the
policy of not taking his seat, while his backers talked of harmony and
proposed George William Curtis for chairman. The confident Fenton,
having retired for the night, would listen to no compromise. Meanwhile
the senior Senator, accompanied by Thomas Murphy, visited the rooms of
the up-State delegates, telling them that a vote for Fenton was a blow
at the Administration.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> This was the argument of desperation. It
meant to one man the loss of a federal office and to another the hope
that one might be gained. Such a significant statement, addressed by
the favourite of the President to internal revenue and post-office
officials, naturally demoralised the Fenton ranks, and when the
convention acted Curtis had 220 votes to 150 for Van Wyck.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
Promptly upon this announcement Conkling, with great cunning, as if
acting the part of a peacemaker, moved that the committee on
organisation report Van Wyck for permanent president. The acceptance
of this suggestion without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.237" id="Page_iii.237">iii. 237</a></span> dissent settled Fenton, who an hour later
heard Conkling named at the head and himself at the foot of the
committee on resolutions.</p>

<p>Thus far Conkling's success had been as unexpected as it was dazzling.
Heretofore he had been in office but not in power. Now for the first
time he had a strong majority behind him. He could do as he liked. He
possessed the confidence of the President, the devotion of his
followers, and the admiration of his opponents, who watched his
tactics in the selection of a candidate for governor with deepest
interest. It was a harrowing situation. For several weeks Horace
Greeley had been the principal candidate talked of, and although the
editor himself did not &quot;counsel or advise&quot; his nomination, he admitted
that &quot;he would feel gratified if the convention should deliberately
adjudge him the strongest candidate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Several circumstances added
to his strength. Conkling had encouraged his candidacy to checkmate
Fenton's support of Marshall O. Roberts. For this reason the President
also favoured him. Besides, Stewart L. Woodford, who really expected
little, offered to withdraw if Greeley desired it,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> while DeWitt
C. Littlejohn, always a Titan in the political arena, likewise
side-stepped. These influences, as Conkling intended, silenced Fenton
and suppressed Roberts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Greeley's old-time enemies had not disappeared. No
one really liked him,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> while party managers, the shadow of whose
ill-will never ceased to obscure his chances, shook their heads.
Reasons given in 1868 were repeated with greater emphasis, and to
prevent his nomination which now seemed imminent, influences that had
suddenly made him strong were as quickly withdrawn. It was intimated
that the President preferred Woodford, and to defeat Fenton's possible
rally to Roberts use was again made of Curtis. The latter did not ask
such preferment, but Conkling, who had made him chairman, promised him
the governorship and Curtis being human acquiesced. In the fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.238" id="Page_iii.238">iii. 238</a></span>
encounter, however, this strategy, as questionable as it was sudden,
destroyed Greeley, humiliated Curtis, and nominated Woodford.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
Conkling's tactics neither commended his judgment nor flattered his
leadership. But Conkling did not then possess the nerve openly to make
war upon Greeley. On the contrary, after secretly informing his
lieutenants of his preference for Curtis, he dodged the vote on the
first ballot and supported Greeley on the second, thus throwing his
friends into confusion. To extricate them from disorder he sought an
adjournment, while Fenton, very adroitly preventing such an excursion
to the repair-shop, forced the convention to support Woodford or
accept Greeley. The feeling obtained that Conkling had lost the
prestige of his early victory, but in securing control of the State
Committee he began the dictatorship that was destined to continue for
eleven years.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Times</i> charged Greeley's defeat upon Fenton, insisting
that &quot;the fault is not to be laid at the door of Senator
Conkling.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Conkling also explained that &quot;Greeley was
pertinaciously supported by all those connected with the custom-house.
He failed from a want of confidence in him, so general among the
delegates that electioneering and persuasion could not prevail against
it, and even those who voted for him declared, in many instances, that
they did so as a harmless compliment, knowing that he could not be
nominated.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Greeley himself avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.239" id="Page_iii.239">iii. 239</a></span> the controversy, but his
acknowledgment of Fenton's loyal support and his sharp censure of
Curtis indicated full knowledge of Conkling's strategy, to whom,
however, he imputed no &quot;bad faith,&quot; since &quot;his aid had not been
solicited and none promised.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Nevertheless, the great editor did
not forget!</p>

<h2>TWEED WINS AND FALLS</h2>

<h2>1870</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> campaign that followed the control of Tweed and Conkling combined
the spectacular and the dramatic. The platform of each party was
catchy. Both congratulated Germany for its victories and France for
its republic. Cuba also was remembered. But here the likeness ceased.
Democrats praised Hoffman, arraigned Grant, sympathised with Ireland,
demanded the release of Fenian raiders and the abolition of vexatious
taxes, declared the system of protection a robbery, and resolved that
a license law was more favourable to temperance than prohibition. On
the other hand, Republicans praised the President, arraigned the
Governor, applauded payments on the national debt and the reduction of
taxation, denounced election frauds and subventions to sectarian
schools, and resolved that so long as towns and cities have the right
to license the sale of liquor, they should also have the right to
prohibit its sale. The live issue, however, was Tammany and the Tweed
frauds. Congress had authorised Circuit Courts of the United States to
appoint in every election district one person from each party to watch
the registration and the casting and the count of votes. It had also
empowered United States marshals to appoint deputies to keep order at
the polls and to arrest for offences committed in their presence.
Against these acts the Democrats vigorously protested, declaring them
unconstitutional, revolutionary, and another step toward
centralisation, while Republicans pointed out their necessity in the
interest of a fair vote and an honest count.</p>

<p>To Conkling the result of the campaign was of the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.241" id="Page_iii.241">iii. 241</a></span> importance.
He had suddenly come into power, and success would materially aid him
in carrying out his policy of reorganising the party in the
metropolis. For many years, under an arrangement with Tammany,
Republicans had held important municipal positions. This custom had
grown out of the appointment of mixed commissions, created by
Republican legislatures, which divided the patronage between the two
parties. But since 1865, under Fenton's skilful manipulation, these
Tammany-Republicans, as they were called, had become the ardent
promoters of the Fenton machine, holding places on the general and
district committees, carrying primaries with the aid of Democratic
votes, and resorting to methods which fair-minded men did not approve.
Among other things it was charged that Fenton himself had a secret
understanding with Democratic leaders.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> These rumours had aroused
the suspicions of many Republicans, who thought it time to dissolve
the Tammany partnership, and having obtained control of the State
Committee in the late convention, Conkling proposed to reorganise the
New York general committee. Fenton was not unmindful of Conkling's
purpose. It had been disclosed in the convention, and to defeat it the
Chautauquan was indifferent to ways and means. During much of the
campaign he absented himself from the State, while threats of avenging
the appointment of Murphy and the removal of Grinnell created the
apprehension that his faction would secretly oppose the ticket.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the canvass Conkling was energetic. He spoke frequently.
That his temper was hot no one who looked at him could doubt, but he
had it in tight control. Although he encountered unfriendly
demonstrations, especially in New York, the pettiness of ruffled
vanity did not ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.242" id="Page_iii.242">iii. 242</a></span>pear. Nothing could be more easy and graceful than
his manner on these occasions. His expository statements, lucid,
smooth, and equally free from monotony and abruptness, were models of
their kind. In dealing with election frauds in New York his
utterances, without growing more vehement or higher keyed, found
expression in the fire of his eye and the resistless strength of his
words. The proud, bold nature of the man seemed to flash out,
startling and thrilling the hearer by the power of his towering
personality.</p>

<p>Revelations of fraud had been strengthened by the publication of the
Eighth Census. In many election districts it appeared that the count
was three, four, five, and even six times as large as an honest vote
could be. Proofs existed, including in some instances a confession,
that in 1868 the same men registered more than one hundred times under
different names&#8212;one man one hundred and twenty-seven times. Instances
were known and admitted in which the same man on the same day voted
more than twenty times for John T. Hoffman. &quot;To perpetuate this
infamy,&quot; declared Conkling, &quot;Mayor Hall has invented since the
publication of the census new escapes for repeaters by changing the
numbers and the boundaries of most of the election districts, in some
cases bisecting blocks and buildings, so that rooms on the same
premises are in different districts, thus enabling colonised repeaters
to register and vote often, and to find doors of escape left open by
officials who have sworn to keep them closed.&quot; The registration for
1870, although twenty thousand less than in 1868, he declared,
contained seventeen thousand known fraudulent entries.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> The
newspapers strengthened his arguments. In one of Nast's cartoons Tweed
as &quot;Falstaff&quot; reviews his army of repeaters, with Hoffman as
sword-bearer, and Comptroller Sweeny, Mayor Hall, James Fisk, Jr., and
Jay Gould as spectators.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Another pre-election cartoon, entitled
&quot;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.243" id="Page_iii.243">iii. 243</a></span> Power behind the Throne,&quot; presented Governor Hoffman crowned and
robed as king, with Tweed grasping the sword of power and Sweeny the
axe of an headsman.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>Democrats resented these attacks. People, still indifferent to or
ignorant of Tweed's misdeeds, rested undisturbed. The Citizens'
Association of New York had memorialised the Legislature to pass the
Tweed charter, men of wealth and character petitioned for its
adoption, and the press in the main approved it.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Even the
<i>World</i>, after its bitter attacks in the preceding winter upon the
Ring officials, championed their cause.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> &quot;There is not another
municipal government in the world,&quot; said Manton Marble, &quot;which
combines so much character, capacity, experience, and energy as are to
be found in the city government of New York under the new
charter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The final Democratic rally of the campaign also
contributed to Tammany's glory. Horatio Seymour was the guest of honor
and August Belmont chairman. Conspicuous in the list of
vice-presidents were Samuel J. Tilden, George Tichnor Curtis, Augustus
Schell, and Charles O'Conor, while Tweed, with Hoffman and McClellan,
reviewed thirty thousand marchers in the presence of one hundred
thousand people who thronged Union Square, attracted by an
entertainment as lavish as the f&#234;tes of Napoleon III. To many this
prodigal expenditure of money suggested as complete and sudden a
collapse to Tweed as had befallen the French Emperor, then about to
become the prisoner of Germany. In the midst of the noise Seymour,
refraining from committing himself to Tammany's methods, read a
carefully written essay on the canals.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> It was noted, too, that
Tilden did not speak.</p>

<p>The election resulted in the choice of all the Democratic candidates,
with sixteen of the thirty-one congressmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.244" id="Page_iii.244">iii. 244</a></span> a majority in each
branch of the Legislature. Hall was also re-elected mayor.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
Republicans extracted a bit of comfort out of the reduced majority in
New York City, but to all appearances Tammany had tightened its grip.
Indeed, on New Year's Day, 1871, when Hoffman and Hall, with almost
unlimited patronage to divide, were installed for a second time, the
Boss had reason to feel that he could do as he liked. From a modest
house on Henry Street he moved to Fifth Avenue. At his summer home in
Greenwich he erected a stable with stalls of finest mahogany. His
daughter's wedding became a prodigal exhibition of great wealth, and
admittance to the Americus Club, his favourite retreat, required an
initiation fee of one thousand dollars. To the poor he gave lavishly.
In the winter of 1870-71 he donated one thousand dollars to each
alderman to buy coal and food for the needy. His own ward received
fifty thousand. Finally, in return for his gifts scattered broadcast
to the press and to an army of prot&#233;g&#233;s, it was proposed to erect a
statue &quot;in commemoration of his services to the Commonwealth of New
York.&quot; His followers thought him invulnerable, and those who despised
him feared his power. In New York he had come to occupy something of
the position formerly accorded to Napoleon III by the public opinion
of Europe.</p>

<p>Tweed's legislative achievements, increasing in boldness, climaxed in
the session of 1871 by the passage of the Acts to widen Broadway and
construct the Viaduct Railroad. The latter company had power to grade
streets, to sell five millions of its stock to the municipality, and
to have its property exempted from taxation,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> while the Broadway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.245" id="Page_iii.245">iii. 245</a></span>
swindle, estimated to cost the city between fifty and sixty
millions,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> enabled members of the Ring to enrich themselves in the
purchase of real estate. To pass these measures Tweed required the
entire Democratic vote, so that when one member resigned to avoid
expulsion for having assaulted a colleague,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> he found it necessary
to purchase a Republican to break the deadlock. The character of
Republican assemblymen had materially changed for the better, and the
belief obtained that &quot;none would be brazen enough to take the risk of
selling out;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> but an offer of seventy-five thousand dollars
secured the needed vote.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Thus did the power of evil seem more
strongly intrenched than ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the constant and unsparing denunciation of the New York
<i>Times</i>, coupled with Nast's cartoons in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, excited
increasing attention to the Ring. As early as 1869 Nast began
satirising the partnership of Tweed, Sweeny, Connolly, and Hall, and
in 1870 the <i>Times</i> opened its battery with an energy and sureness of
aim that greatly disturbed the conspirators. To silence its suggestive
and relentless attacks Tweed sought to bribe its editor, making an
offer of one million dollars.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> A little later he sent word to Nast
that he could have half a million.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Failing in these attempts the
Ring, in November, 1870, secured an indorsement from Marshall O.
Roberts, Moses Taylor, John Jacob Astor, and three others of like
position, that the financial affairs of the city, as shown by the
comptroller's books, were administered correctly. It subsequently
transpired that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.246" id="Page_iii.246">iii. 246</a></span> some of these men were associated with Tweed in the
notorious Viaduct job,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> but for the time their certificate
re-established the Ring's credit more firmly than ever. &quot;There is
absolutely nothing in the city,&quot; said the <i>Times</i>, &quot;which is beyond
the reach of the insatiable gang who have obtained possession of
it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>While Roberts and his associates were certifying to the correctness of
Connolly's books, William Copeland, a clerk in the office, was making
a transcript of the Ring's fraudulent disbursements. Copeland was a
prot&#233;g&#233; of ex-sheriff James O'Brien, who had quarrelled with Connolly
because the latter refused to allow his exorbitant bills, and with the
Copeland transcript he tried to extort the money from Tweed. Failing
in this he offered the evidence to the <i>Times</i>. A little later the
same journal obtained a transcript of fraudulent armoury accounts
through Matthew J. O'Rourke, a county bookkeeper. When knowledge of
the <i>Times'</i> possessions reached the Ring, Connolly offered George
Jones, the proprietor, five million dollars to keep silent. &quot;I cannot
consider your proposition,&quot; said Jones.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Times'</i> publication of the armoury expenses furnished by O'Rourke
created a sensation, but the excitement over the Copeland evidence
grew into a fierce tempest. These figures, carefully tabulated and
printed in large type, showed that the new courthouse, incomplete and
miserably furnished, involved a steal of $8,000,000. One plasterer
received $38,187 for two days' work. Another, during a part of two
months, drew nearly $1,000,000. A carpenter received $350,000 for a
month's labour. A single item of stationery aggregated $186,495, while
forty chairs and three tables cost $179,729. In supplying aldermen
with carriages, mostly for funerals, two liverymen earned $50,000 in a
few days. Advertising in city newspapers amounted to $2,703,308.
Carpets purchased at five dollars per yard would cover City<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.247" id="Page_iii.247">iii. 247</a></span> Hall Park
three times over. As these disclosures appeared in successive issues
the people realised that a gang of very common thieves had been at
work. It was a favourite method to refuse payment for want of money
until a claimant, weary of waiting, accepted the suggestion of
Connolly's agent to increase the amount of his bill. This turned an
honest man into a conspirator and gave the Ring the benefit of the
raise.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>On September 4, 1871, a mass meeting of indignant citizens, held in
Cooper Union, created the Committee of Seventy, and charged it with
the conduct of investigations and prosecutions. Before it could act
vouchers and cancelled warrants, covering the courthouse work for 1869
and 1870, had been stolen from the comptroller's office.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> This
increased the excitement. At last Connolly, to escape becoming a
scape-goat, appointed Andrew H. Green deputy comptroller, and the
Governor designated Charles O'Conor to act in behalf of the
Attorney-General. Thus the Committee of Seventy passed into complete
control of the situation, and under the pressure of suits and arrests
the Ring rapidly lost its power and finally its existence. On October
26, 1871, Tweed was arrested and held to bail in the sum of
$1,000,000, Jay Gould becoming his chief bondsman. Soon after Sweeny
retired from the Board of Park Commissioners, Connolly resigned as
comptroller, and Tweed gave up the offices of grand sachem of Tammany,
director of the Erie Railway, and commissioner of public works. Of all
his associates Mayor Hall alone continued in office, serving until the
end of 1872, the close of his term.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>Having anticipated a little it may not be improper to anticipate a
little more, and say what became of other mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.248" id="Page_iii.248">iii. 248</a></span>bers of this historic
Ring. When the public prosecutor began his work Sweeny and Connolly
fled to Europe.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> After one mistrial, Tweed, found guilty on
fifty-one counts, was sent to prison for twelve years on Blackwell's
Island, but at the end of a year the Court of Appeals reversed the
sentence, holding it cumulative. Being immediately rearrested Tweed,
in default of bail fixed at $3,000,000, remained in jail until his
escape in December, 1875. Disguised by cutting his beard and wearing a
wig and gold spectacles, he concealed his whereabouts for nearly a
year, going to Florida in a schooner, thence to Cuba in a fishing
smack, and finally to Spain, where he was recognised and returned to
New York on a United States man-of-war. He re-entered confinement on
November 23, 1876, and died friendless and moneyless in Ludlow Street
jail on April 12, 1878.</p>

<p>Meantime the Legislature of 1871 had ordered the impeachment of
Barnard and Cardozo of the Supreme Court, and McCunn of the Superior
Court. Their offences extended beyond the sphere of Tweed's
operations, indicating the greed of a Sweeny and the disregard of all
honorable obligations. Cardozo, the most infamous of the trio, called
the Machiavelli of the Bench, weakened under investigation and
resigned to avoid dismissal. Barnard and McCunn, being summarily
removed, were forever disqualified from holding any office of trust in
the State. McCunn died three days after sentence, while Barnard,
although living for seven years, went to his grave at the early age of
fifty.</p>

<p>The aggregate of the Ring's gigantic swindles is known only
approximately. Henry F. Taintor, the auditor employed by Andrew H.
Green, estimated it between forty-five and fifty millions; an
Aldermanic committee placed it at sixty millions; and Matthew J.
O'Rourke, after thorough study, fixed it at seventy-five millions,
adding that if his report had included the vast issues of fraudulent
bonds, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.249" id="Page_iii.249">iii. 249</a></span> swindling by franchises and favours granted, and
peculation by blackmail and extortion, the grand total would aggregate
two hundred millions. Of the entire sum stolen only $876,000 were
recovered.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<h2>CONKLING PUNISHES GREELEY</h2>

<h2>1871</h2>


<p><br />&quot;<span class="smcap">It</span> were idle,&quot; said Horace Greeley, soon after the election in
November, 1870, &quot;to trace the genealogy of the feud which has divided
Republicans into what are of late designated Fenton and Conkling men.
Suffice it that the fatal distraction exists and works inevitable
disaster. More effort was made in our last State convention to triumph
over Senator Fenton than to defeat Governor Hoffman, and in selecting
candidates for our State ticket the question of Fenton and anti-Fenton
was more regarded by many than the nomination of strong and popular
candidates. Since then every Fenton man who holds a federal office has
felt of his neck each morning to be sure that his head was still
attached to his shoulders.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>Conkling's effort to obtain control of the State Committee provoked
this threnody. Subsequently, without the slightest warning, Fenton's
naval officer, general appraiser, and pension agent were removed.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
But as the year grew older it became apparent that designs more fatal
in their consequences than removals from office threatened the Fenton
organisation. It was not a secret that the Governor had kept his
control largely through the management of politicians, entitled
&quot;Tammany Republicans,&quot; of whom &quot;Hank&quot; Smith, as he was familiarly
called, represented an active type. Smith was a member of the
Republican State committee and of the Republican general city
committee. He was also a county supervisor and a Tweed police
commissioner. Moreover, he was the very model of a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.251" id="Page_iii.251">iii. 251</a></span>sourceful
leader, acute and energetic, strong and unyielding, and utterly
without timidity in politics. In supporting Fenton he appointed
Republicans to city offices, took care of those discharged from the
custom-house, and used the police and other instruments of power as
freely as Thomas Murphy created vacancies and made appointments.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
In his despotic sway he had shown little regard for opposition leaders
and none whatever for minorities, until at last a faction of the
general city committee, of which Horace Greeley was then chairman,
petitioned the State committee for a reorganisation. So long as Fenton
controlled State conventions and State committees, Smith's iron rule
easily suppressed such seceders; but when the State committee revealed
a majority of Conkling men, with Cornell as chairman, these
malcontents found ready listeners and active sympathisers.</p>

<p>Alonzo B. Cornell, then thirty-nine years old, had already entered
upon his famous career. From the time he began life as a boy of
fifteen in an Erie Railroad telegraph office, he had achieved
phenomenal success in business. His talents as an organiser easily
opened the way. He became manager of the Western Union telegraph
lines, the promoter of a steamboat company for Lake Cayuga, and the
director of a national bank at Ithaca. Indeed, he forged ahead so
rapidly that soon after leaving the employ of the Western Union, Jay
Gould charged him with manipulating a &quot;blind pool&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.252" id="Page_iii.252">iii. 252</a></span> in telegraph
stocks.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> His education and experience also made him an expert in
political manipulation, until, in 1868, he shone as the Republican
candidate for lieutenant-governor. After his defeat and Grant's
election, he became surveyor of the port of New York, a supporter of
Conkling, and the champion of a second term for the President. His
silence, deepened by cold, dull eyes, justified the title of &quot;Sphinx,&quot;
while his massive head, with bulging brows, indicated intellectual and
executive power. He was not an educated man. Passing at an early age
from his studies at Ithaca Academy into business no time was left him,
if the disposition had been his, to specialise any branch of political
economic science. He could talk of politics and the rapid growth of
American industries, but the better government of great cities and the
need of reform in the national life found little if any place among
his activities. In fact, his close identification with the
organisation had robbed him of the character that belongs to men of
political independence, until the public came to regard him only an
office-holder who owed his position to the favour of a chief whom he
loyally served.</p>

<p>Very naturally the scheme of the malcontents attracted Cornell, who
advised Horace Greeley that after careful and patient consideration
the State Committee,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> by a vote of 20 to 8, had decided upon an
entire reorganisation of his committee. Cornell further declared that
if their action was without precedent so was the existing state of
political af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.253" id="Page_iii.253">iii. 253</a></span>fairs in the city, since never before in the history of
the party had the general committee divided into two factions of
nearly equal numbers, one ordering primaries for the election of a new
committee, and the other calling upon the State committee to direct an
entire reorganisation. However, he continued, abundant precedent
existed for the arbitrary reorganisation of assembly, district, and
ward committees by county committees. Since the State committee bore
the same official relation to county committees that those committees
sustained to local organisations within their jurisdiction, it had
sufficient authority to act in the present crisis.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Conscious of the motive inspiring Cornell's action, Greeley replied
that the State committee was the creature of State conventions,
delegated with certain powers confined to the interval of time between
such conventions. It executed its annual functions and expired. When
contesting delegations from rival general committees had presented
themselves in 1868, the State convention, rather than intrust the
reorganisation to the State committee, appointed a special committee
for the purpose, and when, in 1869, that committee made its report,
the State convention resolved that the general committee of 1870
should thereafter be the regular and the only organisation. Nor was
that all. When a resolution was introduced in the State convention of
1870 to give the State committee power to interfere with the general
committee, the convention frowned and peremptorily dismissed it.
Neither did the State committee, Greeley continued, take anything by
analogy. County committees had never assumed to dissolve or reorganise
assembly or district committees, nor had the power ever been conceded
them, since assembly and district committees were paramount to county
committees. But aside from this the general committee had other and
greater powers than those of county committees, for the State
convention in 1863, in 1866, and again in 1869 ordered that Republican
electors in each city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.254" id="Page_iii.254">iii. 254</a></span> and assembly district should be enrolled into
associations, delegates from each of which composed the general
committee. No such power was conceded to county committees.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>Although this statement seemed to negative its jurisdiction to
interfere, the State committee, exposing the real reason for its
action, based its right to proceed on the existence of improper
practices, claiming that certain officers and members of the Greeley
and district committees held positions in city departments under the
control of Tammany, and that when members of Republican associations
were discharged from federal offices by reason of Democratic
affiliations, they were promptly appointed to places under Democratic
officials.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> To this the Greeley committee replied that Republicans
holding municipal offices did so under a custom growing out of mixed
commissions of Republicans and Democrats, which divided certain places
between the two parties&#8212;a custom as old as the party itself, and one
that had received the sanction of its best men. Indeed, it continued,
George Opdyke, a member of the State committee, had himself, when
mayor, appointed well-known Democrats on condition that Republicans
should share the minor offices,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> and a Republican governor and
Senate, in placing a Tammany official at the head of the
street-cleaning department, invoked the same principle of
division.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Several members of the State committee had themselves,
until recently, held profitable places by reason of such an
understanding without thought of their party fealty being questioned.
It was a recognition of the rights of the minority. As to the wisdom
of such a policy the committee did not express an opinion, but it
suggested that if members of the general committee or of district
associations, holding such city places, should be charged with party
infidelity, prompt expulsion would follow proof of guilt. It declared
itself as anxious to maintain party purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.255" id="Page_iii.255">iii. 255</a></span> and fidelity as the State
committee, and for the purpose of investigating all charges it
appointed a sub-committee.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>It was manifest from the first, however, that no investigation, no
purging of the rolls, no compromise would avail. The charge had gone
forth that &quot;Tammany Republicans&quot; controlled the Greeley committee, and
in reply to the demand for specifications the State committee accused
Henry Smith and others with using Tammany's police, taking orders from
Sweeny, and participating in Ring enterprises to the detriment of the
Republican party.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> &quot;These men,&quot; said the <i>Times</i>, &quot;are receiving
the devil's pay, and consequently, it is to be presumed, are doing the
devil's work. Republicans under Tammany cannot serve two masters. A
Republican has a right to serve Tweed if he chooses. But he ought not
at the same time to be taken into the confidence of Republicans who
wage war against Tammany for debasing the bench, the bar, and every
channel of political life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>To articles of this character Greeley replied that the Republicanism
of Cornell and Smith did not differ. They had graced the same ticket;
they had gone harmonious members of the same delegation to the last
State convention; and they were fellow members of the State committee,
created by that convention, Smith being aided thither by Cornell's
vote.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> In the presence of such evidence the Fenton faction
declared that there was neither soundness nor sincerity in the
<i>Times'</i> statements or in the State committee's charges. Nevertheless,
it was known then and publicly charged afterward that, although
thoroughly honest himself, Greeley had long been associated with the
most selfish politicians in the State outside of Murphy and the
Tammany Ring.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Thus the accusation against &quot;Tammany Republicans&quot;
became a taking cry, since the feeling generally obtained that it was
quite impossible for a man to perform service for Tweed and be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.256" id="Page_iii.256">iii. 256</a></span>
faithful Republican. Formerly the question had assumed less
importance, but Tammany, identified with fraudulent government, a
corrupt judiciary, and a dishonest application of money, could no
longer be treated as a political organisation. Its leaders were
thieves, it was argued, and a Republican entering their service must
also be corrupt. In his letter to John A. Griswold, Conkling openly
charged the Greeley committee with being corrupted and controlled by
Tammany money.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>The controversy, bitter enough before, became still more bitter now.
Conscious that all was lost if the State committee succeeded, the
Greeley organisation, by a vote of 99 to 1, declined to be
reorganised. &quot;The determination of the State committee to dissolve the
regular Republican organisation of the city of New York and to create
another, without cause and without power,&quot; it said, &quot;is an act
unprecedented in its nature, without justification, incompatible with
the principles and life of the Republican party, and altogether an act
of usurpation, unmitigated by either policy or necessity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
Greeley alone appeared willing to yield. He offered a resolution,
which, while describing the State committee's order as an injustice
and a wrong, agreed to obey it; but an adverse majority of 91 to 9
showed that his associates interpreted his real feelings.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>Thus the break had come. It was not an unusual event for the general
city committee to quarrel. For many years Republican contentions in
the metropolis had occupied the attention of the party throughout the
State. In fact a State convention had scarcely met without being
wearied with them. But everything now conspired to make the spirit of
faction unrelenting and to draw the line sharply between friend and
foe. The removal of Grinnell, the declaration of Greeley against
Grant's renomination,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> the intense bitterness between Conkling and
Fenton, and the boast of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.257" id="Page_iii.257">iii. 257</a></span> State committee that it would control
the State convention and substitute its own creature for the Greeley
committee, all coalesced against harmony and a compromise.</p>

<p>Moreover, even the appearance of relations between Greeley and
Conkling had ceased. &quot;Mr. Conkling's frenzy,&quot; said the <i>Tribune</i>,
&quot;generally comes on during executive session, when, if we may be
allowed the metaphor, he gets upon stilts and supports his dignity....
We can see the pose of that majestic figure, the sweep of that
bolt-hurling arm, the cold and awful gleam of that senatorial eye, as
he towers above the listening legislators.&quot; It spoke of him as the
&quot;Pet of the Petticoats,&quot; the &quot;Apollo of the Senate,&quot; the &quot;darling of
the ladies' gallery,&quot; who &quot;could look hyacinthine in just thirty
seconds after the appearance of a woman.&quot; Then it took a shot at the
Senator's self-appreciation. &quot;No one can approach him, if anybody can
approach him, without being conscious that there is something great
about Conkling. Conkling himself is conscious of it. He walks in a
nimbus of it. If Moses' name had been Conkling when he descended from
the Mount, and the Jews had asked him what he saw there, he would
promptly have replied, 'Conkling!' It is a little difficult to see why
Mr. Conkling did not gain a reputation during the war. Many men took
advantage of it for the display of heroic qualities. But this was not
Conkling's opportunity. Is he a man to make a reputation while his
country is in danger? He was not. Probably he knew best when to hitch
his dogcart to a star. Such a man could afford to wait. Wrapped in the
mantle of his own great opinion of himself, he could afford to let his
great genius prey upon itself until the fulness of time.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Of
course, after this there could be no relations between the editor and
the senator. These editorials recalled the Blaine episode, and
although not so steeped in bitterness, as a character-study they did
not differ from the prototype.</p>

<p>This was the condition of affairs when the Republican convention met
at Syracuse on September 27. Except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.258" id="Page_iii.258">iii. 258</a></span> Greeley every prominent leader in
the State attended. The question whether the rival general committee
created by the State organisation should be recognised involved the
whole party, and the audience assembled surpassed any previous
attendance. The presence of a multitude of federal officials as
delegates and leaders indicated that the Administration at Washington
also took a deep interest. There was much doubt and solicitude as to
the result, for no opportunity had been given the factions to measure
strength since the convention of 1870. The nomination of a minority
candidate for speaker of the Assembly in the preceding January had
been claimed as a Fenton victory, but the selection of James W.
Husted, then at the threshold of a long and conspicuous career, did
not turn on such a hinge. Husted had strength of his own. Although
never to become an orator of great power and genuine inspiration, his
quickness of perception, coupled with the manners of an accomplished
gentleman, brilliant in conversation and formidable in debate, made
him a popular favourite whose strength extended beyond faction. Now,
however, the issue was sharply drawn, and when Alonzo B. Cornell
called the convention to order, the opposing forces, marshalled for a
fight to the finish, announced Andrew D. White and Chauncey M. Depew
as their respective candidates for temporary chairman. White's recent
appointment as a commissioner to San Domingo had been a distinct gain
to the President's scheme of annexation, and he now appeared at the
convention in obedience to Cornell's solicitation.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> To gain a bit
of advantage Depew, in the interest of harmony, he said, withdrew in
favour of G. Hilton Scribner of Westchester, who had headed a young
men's association formed to allay strife between the rival senators.
The suggestion being accepted, Depew then moved to make Scribner and
White temporary and permanent chairmen. Upon the temporary chairman
depended the character of the committees, and Cornell, with a frown
upon his large, sallow, cleanly shaven face, promptly ruled the motion
out of order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.259" id="Page_iii.259">iii. 259</a></span> When a Fenton delegate appealed from the Chair's
ruling, he refused to put the question.</p>

<p>Instantly the convention was upon its feet. Demands for roll-call and
the shouts of a hundred men stifled the work of the gavel. Police
interference increased the noise. In the midst of the confusion the
stentorian voice of John Cochrane, a Fenton delegate, declared &quot;the
roll entirely wrong.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> This aggravated the situation. Finally,
when delegates and chairman had physically exhausted themselves, Waldo
M. Hutchins was allowed to suggest that in all cases of contested
seats the names of delegates be passed. To this Cornell reluctantly
agreed amidst loud applause from the Fenton faction, which desired its
action interpreted as an unselfish concession in the interest of
harmony; but the tremendous surprise subsequently displayed upon the
announcement of White's election by 188 to 159 revealed its
insincerity. It had confidently counted on twenty-one additional
votes, or a majority of thirteen.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Thus, in a moment, were
brightest hopes and fairest prospects blasted.</p>

<p>It was easy to speculate as to the cause of this overthrow. To declare
it the triumph of patronage; to assert that delegates from Republican
strongholds supported Fenton and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.260" id="Page_iii.260">iii. 260</a></span> that others from counties with
overwhelming Democratic majorities sustained Conkling; to stigmatise
the conduct of Cornell as an unprecedented exhibition of tyranny, and
to charge White with seeking the votes of Fenton members on the plea
that his action would promote harmony,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> probably did not economise
the truth. Explanations, however, could not relieve the anguish of
defeat or nerve the weak to greater effort. Many delegates, filled
with apprehension and anxious to be on the winning side, thought
annihilation more likely than any sincere and friendly understanding,
a suspicion that White's committee appointments quickly ratified.
Although the Fenton faction comprised nearly one-half the convention,
the Committee on Credentials stood 12 to 2 in favour of Conkling. Of
course the famous president of Cornell University did not select this
committee. He simply followed custom and fathered the list of names
Cornell handed him.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> &quot;But in blindly consenting to be thus used by
the State committee,&quot; wrote Greeley, &quot;he became the instrument of such
an outrage as no respectable presiding officer of any prominent
deliberative body has ever committed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>To the Fenton faction this severe criticism of a presumably fair man
seemed justified after his jug-handle committee had made its
jug-handle report. It favoured seating all contesting delegates
outside of the City, admitted the Greeley delegates and their
opponents with the right to cast half of one vote, and recognised the
organisation established by the State committee as the regular and the
only one. By this time the dullest delegate understood the trend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.261" id="Page_iii.261">iii. 261</a></span>
affairs. Indeed, dismissals and appointments in the civil service had
preceded the assembling of the convention until politicians understood
that the way to preferment opened only to those obedient to the new
dictator. Accordingly, on the next roll-call, the weak-kneed took
flight, the vote standing 202 to 116. Upon hearing the astounding
result a Fenton delegate exclaimed, &quot;Blessed are they that expect
nothing, for they shall not be disappointed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>In discussing the resolution to abolish the Greeley committee the
question narrowed itself to members holding office under Tammany, the
Greeley organisation maintaining that it had simply inherited the
custom, not created it, while Cornell and his associates, having
&quot;Hank&quot; Smith in mind, declared it impossible to avoid the custom
without destroying the committee. To some of the Conkling leaders this
seemed unnecessarily severe. Having showed their teeth they hesitated
to lacerate the party, especially after the mad rush to the winning
side had given them an overwhelming majority. At last, it fell to
Hamilton Ward, a friend of the Senator, for six years a member of
Congress, a forcible speaker, and still a young man of nerve, who was
to become attorney-general and a judge of the Supreme Court, to
propose as a substitute that the State committee be directed to
consolidate and perfect the two city organisations. The Fenton people
promptly acquiesced, and their opponents, after eliminating Smith by
disallowing a member of the organisation to hold office under Tammany,
cheerfully accepted it.</p>

<p>This compromise, thus harmoniously perfected in the presence and
hearing of the convention, was loudly applauded, and the chairman had
risen to put the motion when Conkling interrupted, &quot;Not yet the
question, Mr. President!&quot; Until then the Senator had been a silent
spectator. Indeed, not until the previous roll-call did he become a
member of the convention. But he was now to become its master. His
slow, measured utterances and deep chest-tones commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.262" id="Page_iii.262">iii. 262</a></span> instant
attention. If for a moment, as he calmly declared opposition to the
substitute, he seemed to stand alone, his declaration that a horde of
Tammany ballot-box stuffers, pirates, and robbers had controlled and
debauched the Republican organisation in the city of New York called
forth the loudest applause of the evening. His next statement, that
the time had come when such encroachments must cease, renewed the
cheering. Having thus paid his respects to the Greeley committee,
Conkling argued that a new State committee could not do in the four
weeks preceding election what it had taken the old committee months to
accomplish. The campaign must be made not with a divided organisation,
but with ranks closed up. Reading from an editorial in the <i>Tribune</i>,
he claimed that it approved the committee's report, and he begged the
convention to take the editor at his word, shake hands, bury
animosities and disappointments, make up a ticket equally of both
factions, and accept the reorganisation of the city committee, so that
double delegations might not appear at the next national convention to
parade their dissensions. He disclaimed any unkind feeling, and in
favouring the admission of both city delegations, he said, he supposed
he had worked in the interest of harmony.</p>

<p>This appeal has been called one of Conkling's &quot;most remarkable
speeches.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Unlike the Senator's usual efforts laboured
preparation did not precede it. The striking passage and the
impressive phrase are entirely wanting. Epigrammatic utterances are
the supreme test of a great orator or poet, but Conkling's speech of
September 27 added nothing to that vocabulary. It may be said to lack
every element of a well-ordered oration. As preserved in the
newspapers of the day<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> it is hard, if not impossible, to find
sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.263" id="Page_iii.263">iii. 263</a></span> rhetorical merit to entitle it to a place in any volume of
ordinary addresses. It wanted the persuasive power that allures by an
exquisite choice of words, or charms by noble and sympathetic
elocution. Even the style of his appeal for harmony was too
self-assured and his faith in his own superiority too evident.
Nevertheless, of the living who heard his explosive exclamation, &quot;Not
yet the question, Mr. President,&quot; and the flaming sentences arraigning
the Greeley Republicans as partners of Tammany, it lingers in the
memory as a forceful philippic, full of pose and gesture and dramatic
action. Its influence, however, is not so clear. The power of
patronage had already twice carried the convention, and that this
incentive would have done so again had Conkling simply whispered to
his lieutenants, must be evident to all who read the story. Ward's
motion was lost by 154 to 194, the Conkling vote being eight less than
on the preceding roll-call.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>Conkling desired a solid delegation at the next Republican National
Convention, and the recognition of the organisation established by the
State committee assured it, whereas the Ward amendment, by including
the Greeley constituency, inspired the fear of a divided one.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
Perhaps the failure of his friends to appreciate this fear justified
Conkling's interference, but a single word of dissent was sufficient
to alarm them, while a less arrogant and dominating spirit might
easily have avoided making the bitter assault which provoked a storm
of hostile criticism. Greeley's stinging retort illuminated the
Senator's insincerity. &quot;Conkling declared it right,&quot; said the editor,
&quot;to abolish the regular organisation because corrupted and controlled
by Tammany money, and then invited its delegates to an equal share in
making the platform and selecting a ticket. If he believed what he
said, he was guilty of party treason in the offer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.264" id="Page_iii.264">iii. 264</a></span> if he did not, he
added the folly of insult to the crime of foul slander.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> This was
the view of the Greeley delegates, and refusing to accept the offered
terms, Moses H. Grinnell, Marshall O. Roberts, and their associates,
amid ironical cheers, withdrew from the convention.</p>

<p>After this business progressed smoothly and easily. There were no

<h2>TILDEN CRUSHES TAMMANY</h2>

<h2>1871</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> Conkling was disposing of Greeley and the Fenton organisation,
Samuel J. Tilden prepared to crush Tammany. Tweed had reason to fear
Tilden. In 1869 he accused the Ring of being &quot;opposed to all good
government.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Afterward, in 1870, the defeat of the Young
Democracy's charter added to his bitterness. On the evening of the day
on which that vote occurred, Tweed jeered Tilden as the latter passed
through the hotel corridor, while Tilden, trembling with suppressed
emotion, expressed the belief that the Boss would close his career in
jail or in exile.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> One wonders that Tilden, being a natural
detective, should have delayed strenuous action until the <i>Times'</i>
exposure, but when, at last, a knowledge of the colossal frauds
suddenly opened the way to successful battle, he seized the advantage
with the skill and persistency of a master.</p>

<p>In his crusade he did not unite with Republicans, for whom he had no
liking. He was not only an intense partisan, but he had a positive
genius for saying bitter things in the bitterest way. To him the
quarter of a century covered by Van Buren, Marcy, and Wright, shone as
an era of honour and truth, while the twenty-four years spanned by the
Republicans and the party from whence they sprung brought shame and
disgrace upon the State. &quot;The Republicans made the morals of the
legislative bodies what they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.266" id="Page_iii.266">iii. 266</a></span> recently become. When Seward and
Weed took the place of Wright, Marcy, and Flagg, public and official
morality fell in the twinkling of an eye. Even our city government,
until 1870, was exactly what a Republican legislature made it. The
league between corrupt Republicans and corrupt Democrats, which was
formed during Republican ascendency, proved too strong for honest men.
The charter of 1870 which I denounced in a public speech, had the
votes of nearly all the Republicans and Democrats.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Still, he
admitted that Tammany was synonymous with Democracy, and that its
corruption, especially since its blighting influence had become so
notorious and oppressive, impeded and dishonoured the party. Under its
rule primaries had been absurdities and elections a farce. Without
being thoroughly reorganised, therefore, the party, in his opinion,
could not exist.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>In this spirit Tilden entered upon the great work of his life. Two
classes of Democrats faced him&#8212;the more clamorous reformers and the
enemies of all reform. To the latter reorganisation seemed a reckless
step. It argued that the loss of the Tammany vote meant the
dissolution of the party, and that a great organisation ought not to
be destroyed for the wrong of a few individuals, since the party was
not responsible for them. Besides, the executive power of the State,
with its vast official patronage scattered throughout all the
counties, would oppose such a policy. On the other hand, the first
class, possessing little faith in the party's ability to purge itself,
threatened to turn reform into political revolution. It desired a new
party. Nevertheless, Tilden did not hesitate. He issued letters to
thousands of Democrats, declaring that &quot;wherever the gangrene of
corruption has reached the Democratic party we must take a knife and
cut it out by the roots;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> he counselled with Horatio Seymour and
Charles O'Conor; he origi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.267" id="Page_iii.267">iii. 267</a></span>nated the movement that ultimately sent a
reform delegation to the State convention; he consented to stand for
the Assembly; and finally, to secure the fruit of three months' work,
he raised one-half the funds expended by the Democratic reform
organisation.</p>

<p>The Ring had not been an indifferent observer of these efforts. While
it cared little for the control of a State convention without a
governor to nominate, its continued existence absolutely depended upon
a majority in the Senate. Tweed planned to carry the five senatorial
districts in the city, and to re-elect if possible the eight
Republican senators whom he had used the year before.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> This would
insure him control. To achieve his purpose word was sent to Tilden
early in August that he could name the delegates to the State
convention and the candidates upon the State ticket if he would not
interfere with Tammany's legislative nominations. If Tilden had not
before distrusted Tweed, such a proposition must have aroused his
suspicion. But Tilden, conscious of the need of an anti-Tweed
legislature, had surmised the Ring's plan as early as Tweed devised
it, and he replied with firmness that everything beside the
legislative ticket was of minor importance to him. Similar
propositions, presented by powerful men from all parts of the State
with the plea that a compromise would &quot;save the party,&quot; received the
same answer.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Meanwhile, he laboured to shorten the life of the
Ring. To him Richard Connolly appealed for protection against Tweed's
treachery, and at Tilden's suggestion the comptroller turned over his
office to Andrew H. Green, thus assuring the protection of the records
which subsequently formed the basis of all civil and criminal actions.
Tilden's sagacity in procuring the opinion of Charles O'Conor also
secured the Mayor's acquiescence in Green's possession of the office,
while his patient investigation of the Broadway Bank accounts
discovered the judicial proofs that opened the prison doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.268" id="Page_iii.268">iii. 268</a></span></p><p>These were fatal blows to the Ring. The leading Democratic papers of
the interior, notably the Buffalo <i>Courier</i> and Albany <i>Argus</i>, came
boldly out demanding the dismissal of the shameless robbers who were
disgracing the name and destroying the future of their party.
Moreover, Tilden, like an avenging angel, with all the skill and
knowledge of his kind, had united into one great reform party the four
Democratic organisations of the city, pledged to oppose Tammany.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
This formidable combination, having complied with every requirement of
the State committee, selected delegates to the State convention. The
hearts of Tweed and his associates may well have sunk within them as
they studied this list. There were able lawyers like William E.
Curtis; powerful merchants like Havermeyer; influential editors like
Ottendorfer; solid business men like Schell; and determined members of
the Committee of Seventy like Roswell D. Hatch, who had been
conspicuous in tracking the thieves. But the name that must have shone
most formidably in the eyes of Tweed was that of Charles O'Conor. It
stood at the head of the list like a threatening cloud in the sky,
ready to bring ruin upon the Ring. The moral support of his great
legal fame, affirming the validity of Andrew H. Green's possession of
the comptroller's office, had intimidated O'Gorman, Tweed's
corporation counsel, and shattered the plot to forcibly eject Tilden's
faithful friend under colour of judicial process. Thus the reform
party seemed to be in the ascendant. With confidence Tilden expressed
the belief that the State convention would repudiate Tammany.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>Although it had become well known that Tilden would not compromise,
Tweed lost none of his former prestige. His control of the State
convention which assembled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.269" id="Page_iii.269">iii. 269</a></span> Rochester on October 4 (1871) seemed as
firm as on that day in 1870 when he renominated John T. Hoffman. It
was still the fashion to praise all he said and all he did. Before his
arrival the Reformers claimed a majority, but as the up-State
delegates crowded his rooms to bend the obsequious knee he reduced
these claims to a count, finding only forty-two disobedient members.
He was too tactful, however, to appear in the convention hall. His
duty was to give orders, and like a soldier he pitched his
headquarters near the scene of action, boasting that his friends were
everywhere ready for battle.</p>

<p>In his opening speech Tilden touched the Ring frauds with the delicacy
of a surgeon examining an abscess, and the faint response that greeted
his condemnation of corruption satisfied him that the convention did
not appreciate the danger of party blood-poisoning. The truth of this
diagnosis more fully appeared when Tammany, &quot;in the interest of
harmony,&quot; waived its right to participate in the proceedings. The
whirlwind of applause which greeted this &quot;unselfish act&quot; had scarcely
subsided when a delegate from Kings county, acting for Tweed, moved
the previous question on a resolution reciting that hereafter, on the
call of the roll, the city of New York be omitted since it presented
no delegation bearing the prestige of regularity. This threw the
Reformers into an animated counsel. They knew of the proposed
withdrawal of Tammany, which seemed to them to smooth the way for the
acceptance of their credentials, but the resolution came with
startling suddenness. It narrowed the question of their admission to a
mere technicality and cut off debate. Tilden, appreciating the
ambuscade into which he had fallen, exhausted every expedient to
modify the parliamentary situation, knowing it to be in the power of
the convention to accept another delegation regardless of its
regularity, as the Republicans had done at Syracuse in the previous
week. But the delegates derisively laughed at his awkward predicament
as they adopted the resolution by a vote of 90 to 4.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.270" id="Page_iii.270">iii. 270</a></span></p>

<p>By this act the convention clearly indicated its purpose to treat the
fraud issue as a local matter and to keep it out of the State
campaign. It intended to denounce the crime and the criminals, and to
allow no one to become a delegate who had aided or in anywise profited
by the conspiracy, but it would not recognise a delegation which
desired to reorganise the party in the metropolis by humiliating a
great association whose regularity had been accepted for many years,
and which had finally turned the State over to the Democracy. This
view had the support of every office-holder and of every appointee of
the Executive, whose great desire to &quot;save the party&quot; had its
inspiration in a greater desire to save themselves. On the other hand,
the minority argued that allowing Tammany voluntarily to withdraw from
the convention was equivalent to its endorsement, thus giving its
nominations regularity. This would compel the Democratic masses, in
order to participate in the primaries, to vote its ticket. Tilden
sought to avoid this regularity just as Conkling had destroyed the
Greeley committee, and if office-holders had supported him as they did
the Senator he must have won as easily.</p>

<p>The convention's treatment of Horatio Seymour also exhibited its
dislike of the reformer. Seymour came to the convention to be its
president, and upon his entrance to the hall had been hailed, amidst
tumultuous cheers, as &quot;Our future president in 1872.&quot; While waiting
the conclusion of the preliminary proceedings he observed Francis
Kernan sitting outside the rail with the rejected Reformers.
Hesitatingly, and in the hope, he said, of arousing no unpleasant
discussion, he moved the admission of the veteran Democrat, whom he
described as grown gray in the party harness, and whose very presence
was a sufficient credential to his title to a seat. Kernan, being in
sympathy with Tilden, was <i>non persona grata</i> to Tammany, and Seymour
had scarcely resumed his seat when the ubiquitous delegate from Kings,
with a flourish of rhetoric, promptly substituted another, who, he
alleged, was the regularly elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.271" id="Page_iii.271">iii. 271</a></span> delegate as well as &quot;the friend of
that great Democrat, John T. Hoffman.&quot; The convention, frantic with
delight at the mention of the Governor's name, saw the Oneidan grow
lividly pale with chagrin at this exhibition of Tammany's manners.
Seymour had lived long in years, in fame, and in the esteem of his
party. He could hardly have had any personal enemies. He possessed no
capricious dislikes, and his kindly heart, in spite of a stateliness
of bearing, won all the people who came near him. To be thus opposed
and bantered in a Democratic assembly was a deep humiliation, and
after expressing the hope that the Tammany man would fight for the
Democratic party as gallantly in future as he had fought against it in
the past, the illustrious statesman withdrew his motion. When, later,
his name was announced as presiding officer of the permanent
organisation, the convention discovered to its dismay that Seymour,
feigning sickness, had returned to Utica.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the day's work it was plain that Tweed had controlled
the convention. The Reformers had been excluded, the committee on
contested seats had refused them a hearing, Seymour was driven home,
and a eulogy of Tammany's political services had been applauded to the
echo. The platform did, indeed, express indignation at the &quot;corruption
and extravagance recently brought to light in the municipal affairs of
the city of New York,&quot; and condemned &quot;as unworthy of countenance or
toleration all who are responsible,&quot; but the contrast between the acts
of the convention and the words of its platform made its professions
of indignation seem incongruous if not absolutely empty. When one
speaker, with rhetorical effect, pronounced the frauds in New York
&quot;the mere dreams of Republican imagination&quot; delegates sprang to their
feet amidst ringing cheers. In the joy of victory, Tweed, with
good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.272" id="Page_iii.272">iii. 272</a></span> contempt, characterised Seymour, Tilden, and Kernan as
&quot;three troublesome old fools.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>After adjournment the Reformers made no concealment of their bitter
dissatisfaction. Oswald Ottendorfer, editor of the most powerful
German Democratic organ then in the State, threatened to issue an
address denouncing their betrayal, and William E. Curtis, referring to
the refusal of the credentials' committee, declared that a voice from
the Democratic masses of New York, seeking relief from a gang of
thieves, was stronger, higher, and more sublime than mere questions of
technicality. Under the spur of this threatened revolt, the
convention, when it reconvened the next day, listened to the
Reformers. Their recital was not a panegyric. Ottendorfer said that
the operation of the previous question exposed the party to the
suspicion that Tammany's seats would be open for their return after
the storm of indignation had subsided. O'Conor, in a letter, declared
that absolute freedom from all complicity in the great official crime
and an utter intolerance of all persons suspected of sympathy with it
must be maintained, otherwise its action would inflict a fatal wound
upon the party. Curtis characterised the question as one of life or
death to a great community weighed down by oppression and crime, and
maintained that the convention, if it sought to avoid its duty by the
subterfuge already enacted, would show both sympathy and complicity
with the oligarchy of terror and infamy. These statements did not
please the Ring men, who, with much noise, passed contemptuously out
of the hall.</p>

<p>Riotous interruption, however, did not begin until Tilden announced
that the real point of the controversy was to estop Tammany, after
nominating five senators and twenty-one assemblymen, from declaring
the Democratic masses out of the party because they refused to vote
for its candidates. The whip of party regularity was Tweed's last
reliance, and when Tilden proclaimed absolution to those who
disregarded it, the friends of Tammany drowned his words with loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.273" id="Page_iii.273">iii. 273</a></span>
calls to order. The excitement threatened to become a riot, but
Tilden, caring as little for disapprobation as the son of Tisander in
the story told by Herodotus, calmly awaited silence. &quot;I was stating,&quot;
he continued, without the slightest tremor of a singularly unmusical
voice, &quot;what I considered the objection to Tammany Hall, aside from
the cloud that now covers that concern, and I am free to avow before
this convention that I shall not vote for any one of Mr. Tweed's
members of the Legislature. And if that is to be regarded the regular
ticket, I will resign my place as chairman of the State committee and
help my people stem the tide of corruption. When I come to do my duty
as an elector, I shall cast my vote for honest men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Then, to
show his independence if not his contempt of the Tweed-bound body,
Tilden suddenly waived aside the question of the Reformers' admission
and moved to proceed to the nomination of a State ticket.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>The convention was stunned. It became dizzy when he denied Tammany's
right to be regarded as the regular organisation, but his
proclamation, defiantly and clearly made, that hereafter he should
bolt its nominations even if the convention refused to impeach its
regularity, struck a trenchant blow that silenced rather than excited.
Such courage, displayed at such a critical moment, was sublime. An
organised revolt against an association which had for years been
accepted as regular by State conventions meant the sacrifice of a
majority and an invitation to certain defeat, yet he hurled the words
of defiance into the face of the convention with the energy of the Old
Guard when called upon to surrender at Waterloo. The course taken by
Tilden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.274" id="Page_iii.274">iii. 274</a></span> on this memorable occasion made his own career, and also a new
career for his party. From that hour he became the real leader of the
Democracy. Although more than a twelvemonth must pass before his voice
gave the word of command, his genius as a born master was recognised.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Reformers strengthened the Republicans, whose
distractions must otherwise have compassed their defeat. Murphyism and
Tweedism resembled each other so much that a contest against either
presented a well-defined issue of political morality. The greater
importance of the Tammany frauds, however, obscured all other issues.
To preserve their organisation in the up-State counties the Democrats
made creditable local nominations and professed support of the State
ticket, but in the city the entire voting population, irrespective of
former party alignments, divided into Tammany and anti-Tammany
factions. As the crusade progressed the details of the great crime,
becoming better understood, made Tammany's position intolerable. Every
respectable journal opposed it and every organisation crucified it. In
a double-page cartoon, startling in its conception and splendidly
picturesque, Nast represented the Tammany tiger, with glaring eyes and
distended jaws, tearing the vitals from the crushed and robbed city,
while Tweed and his associates sat enthroned.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> &quot;Let's stop those
damned pictures,&quot; proposed Tweed when he saw it. &quot;I don't care so much
what the papers write about me&#8212;my constituents can't read; but they
can see pictures.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>On October 26 all doubt as to the result of the election was
dissipated. Until then belief in Tweed's direct profit in the Ring's
overcharges was based upon presumption. No intelligent man having an
accurate knowledge of the facts could doubt his guilt, since every
circumstance plainly pointed to it, but judicial proof did not exist
until furnished by the investigation of the Broadway Bank, which
Tilden personally conducted. His analysis of this information
dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.275" id="Page_iii.275">iii. 275</a></span>closed the fact that two-thirds of the money paid under the
sanction of the Board of Audit had passed into the possession of
public officials and their accomplices, some of it being actually
traced into Tweed's pocket, and upon this evidence, verified by
Tilden's affidavit, the Attorney-General based an action on which a
warrant issued for Tweed's arrest. This announcement flashed over the
State eleven days before the election. It was a powerful campaign
document. People had not realised what an avenging hand pursued
Tammany, but they now understood that Tweed was a common thief, and
that Tilden, by reducing strong suspicion to a mathematical certainty,
had closed the mouths of eulogists and apologists.</p>

<p>The result of the election carried dismay and confusion to Tammany.
Its register, its judges, its aldermen, a majority of its assistant
aldermen, fourteen of its twenty-one assemblymen, and four of its five
senators were defeated, while Tweed's majority fell from 22,000 in
1869 to 10,000. As expected the Republicans reaped the benefit of the
anti-Tammany vote, carrying the State by 18,000 majority and the
Legislature by 79 on joint ballot.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> To obliterate Tweedism, Tilden
had overthrown his party, but he had not fallen, Samsonlike, under the
ruin.</p>

<h2>GREELEY NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT</h2>

<h2>1872</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Tammany exposure had absorbed public attention, the
Republican party did not escape serious criticism. Reconstruction had
disappointed many of its friends. By controlling the negro vote
Republican administrations in several Southern States had wrought
incalculable harm to the cause of free-government and equal suffrage.
The State debt of Alabama had increased from six millions in 1860 to
forty millions, that of Florida from two hundred thousand to fifteen
millions, and that of Georgia from three millions to forty-four
millions. &quot;I say to-day, in the face of heaven and before all
mankind,&quot; declared Tilden, &quot;that the carpet-bag governments are
infinitely worse than Tweed's government of the city of New
York.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Following such gross misgovernment the reactionary outbreaks
influenced Congress to pass the so-called Ku-Klux Act of April 20,
1871, designed to suppress these outrages. This measure, although not
dissimilar to others which protected the negro in his right of
suffrage, met with stout Republican opposition, the spirited debate
suddenly heralding a serious party division. Trumbull held it
unconstitutional, while Schurz, reviewing the wretched State
governments of the South, the venal officials who misled the negro,
and the riotous corruption of men in possession of great authority,
attacked the policy of the law as unwise and unsound.</p>

<p>Not less disturbing was the failure of Congress to grant universal
amnesty. To this more than to all other causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.277" id="Page_iii.277">iii. 277</a></span> did the critics of the
Republican party ascribe the continuance of the animosities of the
war, since it deprived the South of the assistance of its former
leading men, and turned it over to inexperienced, and, in some
instances, to corrupt men who used political disabilities as so much
capital upon which to trade. The shocking brazenness of these methods
had been disclosed in Georgia under the administration of Governor
Bullock, who secured from Congress amnesty for his legislative friends
while others were excluded. Schurz declared &quot;When universal suffrage
was granted to secure the equal rights of all, universal amnesty ought
to have been granted to make all the resources of political
intelligence and experience available for the promotion of the welfare
of all.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>The South had expected the President to develop a liberal policy. The
spirit displayed at Appomattox, his &quot;Let us have peace&quot; letter of
acceptance, and his intervention in Virginia and Mississippi soon
after his inauguration, encouraged the belief that he would conciliate
rather than harass it. His approval of the Ku-Klux law, therefore,
intensified a feeling already strained to bitterness, and although he
administered the law with prudence, a physical contest occurred in the
South and a political rupture in the North. The hostility of the
American people to the use of troops at elections had once before
proved a source of angry contention, and the criticism which now
rained upon the Republican party afforded new evidence of the public's
animosity.</p>

<p>These strictures would have awakened no unusual solicitude in the
minds of Republicans had their inspiration been confined to political
opponents, but suddenly there came to the aid of the Democrats a
formidable array of Republicans. Although the entering wedge was a
difference of policy growing out of conditions in the Southern States,
other reasons contributed to the rupture. The removal of Motley as
minister to England, coming so soon after Sumner's suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.278" id="Page_iii.278">iii. 278</a></span>cessful
resistance to the San Domingo scheme, was treated as an attempt to
punish a senator for the just exercise of his right and the honest
performance of his duty. Nine months later Sumner was discontinued as
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. If doubt existed as to
the ground of Motley's removal, not a shadow clouded the reason for
Sumner's deposition. The cause assigned was that he no longer
maintained personal and social relations with the President and
Secretary of State, but when Schurz stigmatised it as &quot;a flimsy
pretext&quot; he voiced the opinion of a part of the press which accepted
it as a display of pure vindictiveness. &quot;The indignation over your
removal,&quot; telegraphed John W. Forney, &quot;extends to men of all parties.
I have not heard one Republican approve it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Among Sumner's
correspondents Ira Harris noted the popular disapproval and
indignation in New York. &quot;Another term of such arrogant assumption of
power and wanton acquiescence,&quot; said Schurz, &quot;may furnish the flunkies
with a store of precedents until people cease to look for ordinary
means of relief.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>More disturbing because more irritating in its effects was the
Administration's disposition to permit the control of its patronage by
a coterie of senators, who preferred to strengthen faction regardless
of its influence. Under this policy something had occurred in nearly
every Northern State to make leading men and newspapers bitter, and as
the years of the Administration multiplied censure became more
drastic. Perhaps the influence of Conkling presented a normal phase of
this practice. The Senator stood for much that had brought criticism
upon the party. He approved the Southern policy and the acquisition of
San Domingo. He indulged in a personal attack on Sumner, advised his
deposition from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, commended the
removal of Motley, and voted against the confirmation of E. Rockwood
Hoar for associate justice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.279" id="Page_iii.279">iii. 279</a></span> the Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> He also opposed
civil service reform.</p>

<p>A statesman so pronounced in his views and in control of abundant
patronage was not likely to change a contest for personal advantage
into a choice of public policies. Such an one appointed men because of
their influence in controlling political caucuses and conventions.
&quot;The last two State conventions were mockeries,&quot; declared Greeley,
&quot;some of the delegates having been bought out of our hands and others
driven out of the convention.... I saw numbers, under threats of
losing federal office, dragooned into doing the bidding of one
man.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> The removal of officials whose names stood high in the roll
of those who had greatly honoured their State deeply wounded many
ardent Republicans, but not until the appointment and retention of
Thomas Murphy did criticism scorn the veil of hint and innuendo. This
act created a corps of journalistic critics whose unflagging satire
and unswerving severity entertained the President's opponents and
amazed his friends. They spoke for the popular side at the moment of a
great crisis. Almost daily during the eighteen months of Murphy's
administration the press of the whole country, under the lead of the
<i>Tribune</i>, pictured the collector as a crafty army contractor and the
partner of Tweed. &quot;I think the warmest friends of Grant,&quot; wrote
Curtis, &quot;feel that he has failed terribly as President, not from want
of honesty but from want of tact and great ignorance. It is a
political position and he knew nothing of politics.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The
sacrifice of the best men among his cabinet advisers added greatly to
this unrest. In one of his letters, Lowell, unintentionally
overlooking Hamilton Fish, declared that E. Rockwood Hoar and Jacob D.
Cox were &quot;the only really strong men in the Cabinet.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> After the
latter's forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.280" id="Page_iii.280">iii. 280</a></span> resignation and the former's sudden exit to make room
for a Southern Republican in order to placate carpet-bag senators for
the removal of Sumner, the great critics of the Administration again
cut loose. &quot;How long,&quot; asked Bowles, &quot;does the President suppose the
people will patiently endure this dealing with high office as if it
were a presidential perquisite, to be given away upon his mere whim,
without regard to the claims of the office? It was bad enough when he
only dealt so with consulates and small post-offices; but now that he
has come to foreign ministers and cabinet officers it is
intolerable.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>Under these conditions Republicans had been losing strength. In the
election of 1870 their numbers, for the first time since 1864, had
fallen below a two-thirds majority in the national House, while the
Democrats gained four United States senators. In the same year Carl
Schurz, with the assistance of the Democrats, had carried Missouri on
the issue of universal amnesty. As the disaffection with the
Administration became more pronounced, this faction, assuming the name
of Liberal Republicans, met in convention at Jefferson City on January
24, 1872, and invited all Republicans who favoured reform to meet in
national mass convention at Cincinnati on May 1. This call acted like
a lighted match in a pile of shavings, prominent Republicans in every
State, including many leading newspapers, giving it instant and hearty
response. Among other journals in New York the <i>Nation</i> and the
<i>Evening Post</i> guardedly approved the movement, and the <i>World</i>,
although a Democratic organ, offered conditional support. The
<i>Tribune</i> also encouraged the hope that it would eventually swing into
line.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley's principles were in substantial accord with those of
his party. He had little liking for civil service re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.281" id="Page_iii.281">iii. 281</a></span>form; the
integrity of the national debt invoked his unflagging support; and the
suppression of the Ku-Klux, although favouring a liberal Southern
policy, had received his encouragement.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Nor had he said anything
in speech or writing disrespectful of the President. He did not favour
his renomination, but he had faith in the essential honesty and
soundness of Republican voters. Moreover, the demand for &quot;a genuine
reform of the tariff&quot; made it impossible to reconcile his policy with
that of the Liberal Republicans of Missouri.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Greeley's position in the Republican party had become
intolerable. Conkling controlled the city and State machines, Fenton
belonged in a hopeless minority, and Grant resented the <i>Tribune's</i>
opposition to his succession. Besides, the editor's friends had been
deeply humiliated. The appointment of Murphy was accepted as &quot;a plain
declaration of war.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The treatment of the Greeley committee,
overthrown by the power of patronage, also festered in his heart. &quot;For
more than a year,&quot; he said, &quot;to be an avowed friend of Governor Fenton
was to be marked for proscription at the White House.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Thus, with
the past unforgiven and the future without hope, the great journalist
declared that &quot;We propose to endure this for one term only.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>From the first it was apparent that the Republican schism, to be
successful, needed the support of the <i>Tribune</i>. Although its
influence had materially suffered during and since the war, it still
controlled a great constituency throughout the North, and the longer
its chief hesitated to join the new party the more earnest and
eloquent did the appeals of the Liberals become. At last, relying upon
a compromise of their economic differences, Greeley accepted the
invitation to meet the Missouri reformers in convention.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> His
action was the occasion for much rejoicing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.282" id="Page_iii.282">iii. 282</a></span> on April 13 the
Liberals of New York City began their campaign amidst the cheers of an
enthusiastic multitude assembled at Cooper Institute.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> The Fenton
leaders, conspicuously posted on the platform, indicated neither a
real love of reform nor an absence of office-seekers, but the presence
among the vice-presidents of E.L. Godkin of the <i>Nation</i> and Parke
Godwin of the <i>Post</i> removed all doubt as to the sincere desire of
some of those present to replace Grant with a President who would
discourage the use of patronage by enforcing civil service reform, and
encourage good government in the South by enacting universal amnesty.
To Schurz's charge that the national Republican convention would be
made up of office-holders, Oliver P. Morton declared, three days later
in the same hall, that there would be more office-seekers at
Cincinnati than office-holders at Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>The managers of the Liberal Republican movement preferred Charles
Francis Adams for President. Adams' public life encouraged the belief
that he would practise his professed principles, and although isolated
from all political associations it was thought his brilliant
championship of the North during the temporising of the English
government would make his nomination welcome. David Davis and Lyman
Trumbull of Illinois were likewise acceptable, and Salmon P. Chase had
his admirers. Greeley's availability was also talked of. His signature
to the bail-bond of Jefferson Davis, releasing the ex-president of the
Confederacy from prison, attracted attention to his presidential
ambition, while his loud declaration for universal amnesty opened the
way for a tour of the South. At a brilliant reception in Union Square,
given after his return, he described the carpet-bagger as &quot;a worthless
adventurer whom the Southern States hate and ought to hate,&quot; likening
him to the New York legislator &quot;who goes to Albany nominally to
legis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.283" id="Page_iii.283">iii. 283</a></span>late, but really to plunder and steal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> His excessive zeal
for Democratic support led to the intimation that he had economised
his epithets in criticising the Tweed ring.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> As early as February,
Nast, with his usual foresight, pictured &quot;H.G., the editor&quot; offering
the nomination to &quot;H.G., the farmer,&quot; who, rejoicing in the name of
Cincinnatus, had turned from the plough toward the dome of the Capitol
in the distance.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> To the charge that he was a candidate for
President, Greeley frankly admitted that while he was not an aspirant
for office, he should never decline any duty which his political
friends saw fit to devolve upon him.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the men whose earnest efforts had prepared the way for
the Liberal movement did not encourage Greeley's ambition. Especially
were his great newspaper associates dumb. A week before the convention
Bowles of the Springfield <i>Republican</i> mentioned him with Sumner and
Trumbull as a proper person for the nomination, but Godkin of the
<i>Nation</i>, Halstead of the Cincinnati <i>Commercial</i>, and Horace White of
the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> remained silent. The <i>Evening Post</i> spoke of him
as &quot;the simple-minded philanthropist, with his various scraps of
so-called principles.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Jacob D. Cox, Stanley Matthews, and George
Hoadley, the conspicuous Liberal triumvirate of Ohio, repudiated his
candidacy, and Schurz, in his opening speech as president of the
convention, without mentioning names, plainly designated Adams as the
most suitable candidate and Greeley as the weakest.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>The first New Yorker to appear at Cincinnati was Reuben E. Fenton,
followed by John Cochrane, Waldo M. Hutchins, Sinclair Tousey, and
other seceders from the Syracuse convention of 1871. These political
veterans, with the cunning practised at ward caucuses, quickly
organised the New York delegation in the interest of Greeley. On
motion of Cochrane, Hutchins became chairman of a committee to name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.284" id="Page_iii.284">iii. 284</a></span>
sixty-eight delegates, the people present being allowed to report two
delegates from their respective congressional districts. These tactics
became more offensive when the committee, instead of accepting the
delegates reported, arbitrarily assumed the right to substitute
several well-known friends of Greeley. Not content with this
advantage, the majority, on motion of Cochrane, adopted the unit rule,
thus silencing one-third of the delegation.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Henry R. Selden,
whose reputation for fair dealing had preceded him, characterised this
performance as &quot;a most infamous outrage,&quot; and upon hearing a protest
of the minority, presented by Theodore Bacon of Rochester, Schurz
denounced the proceeding &quot;as extraordinary&quot; and &quot;as indicating that
the reform movement, so far as it concerned New York, was virtually in
the hands of a set of political tricksters, who came here not for
reform, but for plunder.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Next to the &quot;tricksters&quot; the platform-makers embarrassed the
convention. It was easy to recognise the equality of all men before
the law, to pledge fidelity to the Union, to oppose the re-election of
the President, to denounce repudiation, to demand local
self-government for the Southern States, to ask &quot;the immediate and
absolute removal of all disabilities imposed on account of the
rebellion,&quot; and to favour &quot;a thorough reform of the civil service;&quot;
but for a tariff reform assemblage to frame a resolution which the
apostle of protection could accept required great patience and
persistence. The vexatious delay became so intolerable that delegates
insisted upon making a ticket before adopting a platform. Cochrane
bitterly opposed such a resolution since Greeley's candidacy, if not
his support of the movement, depended upon the convention's attitude
on the tariff. Indeed, not until the committee on resolutions had
accepted what the editor himself dictated was the knotty point finally
settled. &quot;Recognising,&quot; said the platform, &quot;that there are in our
midst honest but irreconcilable dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.285" id="Page_iii.285">iii. 285</a></span>ferences of opinion with regard to
the respective systems of protection and free-trade, we remit the
discussion of the subject to the people in their congressional
districts and to the decision of Congress thereon, wholly free from
executive interference or dictation.&quot;</p>

<p>Although the resolution was out of keeping with the spirit of the
movement, it seemed proper to pay this extortionate price for
Greeley's support, since his conspicuous championship of protection
made it impossible for him to acquiesce in any impairment of that
doctrine; but the advantage that such a concession gave his candidacy
appears not to have occurred to the leaders who embodied whatever of
principle and conviction the convention possessed. Indeed, no scheme
of the managers contemplated his nomination. To many persons Greeley's
aspiration took the form of &quot;a joke.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Nor was his name seriously
discussed until the delegates assembled at Cincinnati. Even then the
belief obtained that after a complimentary vote to him and other
favourite sons, Adams would become their beneficiary. But the work of
Fenton quickly betrayed itself. In obedience to a bargain, Gratz Brown
of Missouri, at the end of the first ballot, withdrew in favour of
Greeley, and although Adams held the lead on the next four ballots,
the strength of Davis and Trumbull shrivelled while Greeley's kept
increasing. Yet the managers did not suspect a stampede. Eighty per
cent. of the New Yorker's votes came from the Middle and Southern
States.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Moreover, the Trumbull men held the balance of power.
After several notable changes Adams still led by half a hundred. On
the sixth ballot, however, to the surprise and chagrin of the Adams
managers, Trumbull's delegates began breaking to Greeley, and in the
confusion which quickly developed into a storm of blended cheers and
hisses, Illinois and the Middle West carried the <i>Tribune's</i> chief
beyond the required number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.286" id="Page_iii.286">iii. 286</a></span> votes.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Gratz Brown was then
nominated for Vice-President.</p>

<p>Greeley's nomination astounded the general public as much as it
disappointed the Liberal leaders. Bowles called the result &quot;a fate
above logic and superior to reason,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> but the <i>Evening Post</i>
thought it due to &quot;commonplace chicanery, intrigue, bargaining, and
compromise.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Stanley Matthews, who was temporary chairman of the
convention, declared himself greatly chagrined at the whole matter. &quot;I
have concluded,&quot; he said, &quot;that as a politician and a President maker,
I am not a success.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> Hoadly published a card calling the result
&quot;the alliance of Tammany and Blair,&quot; and William Cullen Bryant, Oswald
Ottendorfer of the <i>Staats-Zeitung</i>, and other anti-protectionists of
New York, made a fruitless effort to put another candidate before the
country.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> In the end the <i>Nation</i> and the <i>Evening Post</i> supported
President Grant.</p>

<p>The nomination deeply mortified the Democrats. They had encouraged the
revolt, expecting the selection of Adams, or Trumbull, or David Davis,
whom they could readily adopt, but Greeley, a lifelong antagonist,
plunged them into trouble. No other Republican had so continuously
vilified them. From his introduction to political life in 1840 he had
waged a constant and personal warfare, often using his strong,
idiomatic English with the ferocity of a Wilkes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.287" id="Page_iii.287">iii. 287</a></span> A caricature by
Greeley was as much feared as a cartoon by Nast. He spared no one. He
had assailed Seymour with a violence that might well seem to have made
any form of political reconciliation impossible. With equal skill he
had aimed his epithets at every Democratic statesman and politician
from Van Buren to Fernando Wood, the sting of his relentless and
merciless criticism goading each one into frenzy. For them now to
assume to overlook such treatment and accept its author as a political
associate and exemplar seemed a mockery. Several Democratic journals,
following the lead of the <i>World</i>, refused to do so, while others,
shrouding their disinclination in a non-committal tone, awaited the
assembling of the State convention which met at Rochester on May 15.
Seymour did not attend this meeting, and although Tilden carefully
avoided an expression of opinion, the delegates, after approving the
Cincinnati platform, insisted upon referring the choice of candidates
to the national convention, sending John T. Hoffman as a
delegate-at-large to represent them.</p>

<p>One month later the Democratic national convention met at
Baltimore.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Although the delegates, especially those from the
South, indicated a growing sentiment in favour of Greeley, the absence
of veteran leaders from the North created much comment. Hendricks of
Indiana sent his regrets; Seymour also remained at home; and Tilden,
Kernan, and Sanford E. Church found it convenient to be otherwise
engaged. But August Belmont appeared, and for the last time, after
twelve years of service and defeat as chairman of the national
committee, called the convention to order. John T. Hoffman also
appeared. He was the best known if not the wisest delegate in the
convention, and as he actively joined the Southern leaders in
encouraging the new order of things, it was easy to understand how his
star might still have been in the ascendant had his political
associates been content with power without plunder. Samuel S. Cox,
recently characterised by Greeley as &quot;our carpet-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.288" id="Page_iii.288">iii. 288</a></span>bag representative
in Congress&quot; who had &quot;cast in his lot with thieves,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> also
smoothed the way for his critic's nomination. He could forgive if he
did not forget.</p>

<p>Next to Cox sat John Kelly, the new boss of Tammany. The combativeness
indicated by the form of the head was accentuated by the conspicuous
jaw, the firm, thin-lipped mouth, and the closely cropped hair and
beard, already fading into white; but there was nothing rough or
rowdyish in his manner or appearance. He dressed neatly, listened
respectfully, and spoke in low, gentle tones, an Irish sense of humour
frequently illuminating a square, kindly face. It was noticeable, too,
that although he began life as a mason and had handled his fists like
a professional, his hands were small and shapely. Kelly had served two
years as alderman, four years in Congress, and six years as sheriff.
He had also represented his county in the national conventions of 1864
and 1868. His character for honesty had not been above suspicion. Men
charged that he was &quot;counted in&quot; as congressman, and that while
sheriff he had obtained a large sum of money by illegal methods.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
In 1868 he suddenly sailed for Europe because of alleged ill-health,
where he remained until late in 1871. He was a rich man then.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
Now, at the age of fifty-one, he was destined to make himself not less
powerful or widely known than the great criminal whom he
succeeded.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> With the aid of Til<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.289" id="Page_iii.289">iii. 289</a></span>den, O'Conor, and other men
conspicuous in the reform movement, he had reorganised Tammany in the
preceding April, increasing a new general committee to five hundred
members, and with great shrewdness causing the appointment of
committees to co&#246;perate with the Bar Association, with the Committee
of Seventy, and with the Municipal Taxpayers' Association. These
represented regenerated Tammany. Kelly affected extreme modesty, but
as he moved about the hall of the national convention, urging the
nomination of Greeley, the delegates recognised a master in the art of
controlling men.</p>

<p>If any doubt had existed as to Greeley's treatment at Baltimore, it
quickly disappeared on the assembling of the convention, for the
question of nomination or indorsement alone disturbed it. If it
adopted him as its own candidate fear was entertained that Republicans
would forsake him. On the other hand, it was claimed that many
Democrats who could only be held by party claims would not respect a
mere indorsement. Southern delegates argued that if Democrats hoped to
defeat their opponents they must encourage the revolt by giving it
prestige and power rather than smother it by compelling Liberals to
choose between Grant and a Democrat. The wisdom of this view could not
be avoided, and after adopting the Cincinnati platform without change,
the convention, by a vote of 686 to 46, stamped the Cincinnati ticket
with the highest Democratic authority.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Little heartiness,
however, characterised the proceedings. Hoffman, in casting New York's
vote, aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.290" id="Page_iii.290">iii. 290</a></span> much enthusiasm, but the response to the announcement
of Greeley's nomination was disappointing. The <i>Tribune</i> attributed it
to the intense heat and the exhaustion of the delegates,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> but the
<i>Nation</i> probably came nearer the truth in ascribing it to &quot;boiled
crow.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> This gave rise to the expression &quot;to eat crow,&quot; meaning
&quot;to do what one vehemently dislikes and has before defiantly declared
he would not do.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<h2>DEFEAT AND DEATH OF GREELEY</h2>

<h2>1872</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> Republicans of New York welcomed the outcome of the Democratic
national convention. There was a time in its preliminary stages when
the Liberal movement, blending principle and resentment, had assumed
alarming proportions. Discontent with the Administration, stimulated
by powerful journals, seemed to permeate the whole Republican party,
and the haste of prominent men to declare themselves Liberals,
recalling the unhappy division in the last State convention and the
consequent falling off in the Republican vote, added to the
solicitude. Moreover, the readiness of the Democrats to approve the
principles of the Missouri reformers suggested a coalition far more
formidable than the Philadelphia schism of 1866. That movement was to
resist untried Reconstruction, while the Missouri division was an
organised protest against practices in the North as well as in the
South which had become intolerable to men in all parties. Gradually,
however, the Republican revolt in New York disclosed limitations which
the slim attendance at Cincinnati accentuated. Several congressional
districts had been wholly unrepresented, and few prominent men had
appeared at Cincinnati other than free-traders and Fenton leaders.
Such an exhibition of weakness had an exhilarating effect upon
Republicans, who received the nomination of Greeley with derision.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind the friends of the Administration, meeting in
State convention at Elmira on May 15, sent a delegation to
Philadelphia, headed by the venerable Gerrit Smith, which boasted that
it was without an office-holder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.292" id="Page_iii.292">iii. 292</a></span> Three weeks later the Republican
national convention, amidst great enthusiasm, unanimously renominated
Grant for President. A single ballot sufficed also for the selection
of Henry Wilson of Massachusetts for Vice-President.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The
platform, to offset the Liberals' arraignment, favoured civil service
reform, the abolition of the franking privilege, the prohibition of
further land grants to corporations, an increase in pensions, and &quot;the
suppression of violent and treasonable organisations&quot; in the South.</p>

<p>At their State convention, held in Utica on August 21, Republicans
felt no fear of factional feuds since the aggressive Fenton leaders
had passed into the Liberal camp. But reasons for alarm existed. The
election in 1871, carried by the inspiration of a great popular
uprising in the interest of reform, had given them control of the
Legislature, and when it assembled honest men rejoiced, rogues
trembled, and Tweed failed to take his seat. The people expected the
shameless Erie ring and its legislation to be wiped out, corrupt
judges to be impeached, a new charter for New York City created, the
purity of the ballot-box better protected, canal management reformed,
and a variety of changes in criminal practice. But it proved timid and
dilatory. At the end of the session the Tweed charter still governed,
the machinery of the courts remained unchanged, and reforms in canal
management, in elections, and in the city government had been
sparingly granted. In cases of proven dishonesty its action was no
less disappointing. It allowed a faithless clerk of the Senate to
resign without punishment;<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> it permitted the leaders of the
Tammany ring to continue in office; it decided that a man did not
disqualify himself for a seat in the Senate by taking bribes;<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> and
it failed to attack the Erie ring until the reign of Jay Gould was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.293" id="Page_iii.293">iii. 293</a></span>
destroyed by the bold action of Daniel E. Sickles.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Never did a
party more shamelessly fail in its duty. Even credit for the
impeachment of the Tweed judges belonged to Samuel J. Tilden. &quot;That
was all Tilden's work, and no one's else,&quot; said Charles O'Conor. &quot;He
went to the Legislature and forced the impeachment against every
imaginable obstacle, open and covert, political and personal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Such a record did not inspire the party with confidence, and its
representatives looked for a head to its State ticket who could
overcome its shortcomings. Of the names canvassed a majority seemed
inclined to William H. Robertson of Westchester. He had been an
assemblyman, a representative in Congress, a judge of his county for
twelve years, and a State senator of distinguished service. Although
prudent in utterance and somewhat cautious in entering upon a course
of action, his indefatigable pursuit of an object, coupled with
conspicuous ability and long experience, marked him as one of the
strong men of New York, destined for many years to direct the politics
of his locality.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a feeling existed that his course in the Senate had
lacked force. The New York <i>Times</i> severely criticised it, regarding
him too much of a tenderfoot in pushing the reform movement, and on
the eve of the convention it opposed his candidacy.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> The <i>Times</i>,
then the only paper in New York City upon which the party relied with
confidence to fight its battles, exerted an influence which could
scarcely be overrated. However, it is doubtful if its opposition could
have avoided Robertson's nomination had not the name of John A. Dix
been sprung upon the convention. It came with great suddenness. No
open canvass preceded it. Thurlow Weed, who had proposed it to nearly
every convention since 1861, was in Utica, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.294" id="Page_iii.294">iii. 294</a></span> Henry Clews, the
well-known banker, belonged the credit of presenting it &quot;on behalf of
the business men of New York.&quot; The captivating suggestion quickly
caught the delegates, who felt the alarming need of such a candidate,
and the audience, rising to its feet, broke into cheers, while county
after county seconded the nomination. One excited delegate, with
stentorian voice, moved that it be made by acclamation, and although
the Chair ruled the motion out of order, the withdrawal of Robertson's
name quickly opened a way for its passage.</p>

<p>This incident produced a crop of trouble. Because Clews happened to be
the guest of Conkling, Robertson, grievously disappointed, assumed
that the Senator had inspired the <i>coup d'&#233;tat</i>, and from that moment
began the dislike which subsequently ripened into open enmity. &quot;As a
matter of fact,&quot; wrote Clews, &quot;Conkling knew nothing of my intention,
but he was either too proud or too indifferent to public sentiment to
explain.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Dix's political course had been a tortuous one. He followed the Van
Burens in 1848, becoming the Barnburners' candidate for governor, and
immediately preceding the reduction of Fort Sumter advocated the
restoration of the Missouri compromise, perpetuating slavery in all
territory south of 36&#176; 30&#180;. After the war he joined President Johnson,
presided at the famous Philadelphia convention in 1866, and in return
received appointments as minister to The Hague and later to France.
For several years, under the changing conditions of Weed's leadership,
he figured as a possible candidate for governor, first of one party
and then of the other, but the Republicans declined to accept him in
1862 and 1864, and the Democrats refused to take him in 1866. After
President Grant had relieved him of the French mission by the
appointment of Elihu B. Washburne, he inclined like Weed himself to
the Liberal movement until the nomination of Greeley, whom they both
despised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.295" id="Page_iii.295">iii. 295</a></span></p>

<p>Seymour charged Dix with being &quot;a mercenary man,&quot; who &quot;rented out his
influence gained from political positions to companies of doubtful
character for large pay.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> At a later day he sketched his
readiness &quot;to change his politics&quot; for &quot;a large consideration and pay
down.&quot; It was a drastic arraignment. &quot;Starting out with a view of
being an Anti-Mason,&quot; wrote Seymour, &quot;he shifted to the Democratic
party for the office of adjutant-general. He hesitated between Cass
and Van Buren until he was nominated for governor by the Free-Soilers.
He went back to the Democratic party for the New York post-office
under Pierce. He went over to Buchanan for a place in the cabinet; and
from his Free-Soil views he became so violent for the South that he
would not vote for Douglas, but supported Breckinridge. After
presiding at an anti-war meeting he went over to Lincoln, when he was
made a major-general. To get a nomination for the French mission he
took part with President Johnson. To get confirmed he left him for
Grant. In 1868 he intrigued for a presidential nomination from the
Democratic party; as in 1866 he had tried to be nominated by the same
party for the office of governor. I think this history shows that he
valued his political principles at a high rate, and never sold them
unless he got a round price and pay down.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>Of the same age as Dix, Weed knew his history perfectly, which during
and after the war resembled his own. But he had faith that Dix's war
record would more than offset his political vagaries. &quot;When there was
danger that Washington would fall into the hands of the rebels,&quot; he
said, &quot;Dix severed his relations with the Democratic administration,
and in concert with Secretary Holt, Mr. Stanton, and Mr. Seward,
rendered services which saved the nation's capital. A few weeks
afterward, when in command of Fort McHenry, by a prompt movement
against a treasonable design of members of the Legislature, he
prevented Maryland from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.296" id="Page_iii.296">iii. 296</a></span> joining the Secessionists.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Moreover,
Weed insisted that conservative Democrats and business men, having
confidence in his integrity, would vote for him regardless of party.</p>

<p>The platform, endorsing the National Administration, failed to mention
the record of the Legislature. Praise for members of Congress
accentuated this omission. To enlarge the canal for steam navigation
it favoured an appropriation by the general government.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>The Democrats and Liberals met in separate State conventions at
Syracuse on September 4. In numbers and enthusiasm the Liberals made a
creditable showing. Many Republicans who had assisted at the birth of
their party and aided in achieving its victories, adorned the platform
and filled the seats of delegates. John Cochrane called the convention
to order, Truman G. Younglove, speaker of the Assembly in 1869, acted
as temporary chairman, Chauncey M. Depew became its president, and
Reuben E. Fenton, with Waldo M. Hutchins, Archibald M. Bliss, Edwin A.
Merritt, D.D.S. Brown, and Frank Hiscock, served upon the committee of
conference. Among others present were Sinclair Tousey, William
Dorsheimer, George P. Bradford, and Horatio N. Twombly. In his speech
on taking the chair, Depew, who had attended every Republican State
convention since 1858, declared that he saw before him the men whom he
had learned to recognise as the trusted exponents of party policy in
their several localities.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>In apportioning the State offices the Democrats, after much wrangling,
conceded to the Liberals the lieutenant-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.297" id="Page_iii.297">iii. 297</a></span>governor, prison inspector,
and fifteen of the thirty-four electors. This settlement resulted,
amidst much enthusiasm, in the nomination of Depew for
lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>The Democrats experienced more difficulty in selecting a candidate for
governor. The withdrawal of Hoffman, who &quot;usually made his
appointments to office,&quot; said John Kelly, &quot;on the recommendation of
the Tammany ring and at the solicitation of the Canal ring,&quot; was
inevitable,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and long before he declined several aspirants had
betrayed their ambition.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> But a decided majority of the delegates,
&quot;fully four-fifths&quot; declared the New York <i>Times</i>,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> preferred
Sanford E. Church, then chief judge of the Court of Appeals, who
became known as the &quot;ring candidate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> On the other hand, Kernan
had the support of Tilden, against whom the same combination arrayed
itself that controlled at Rochester in 1871. Although the Tweed ring
had practically ceased to exist, its friendships, rooted in the rural
press and in the active young men whom it had assisted to positions in
Albany and New York, blocked the way. Besides, Kernan himself had
invited open hostility by vigorously supporting Tilden in his crusade
against Tammany. Thus the contest became complicated and bitter.</p>

<p>It was an anxious moment for Tilden. Kelly stood for Schell, Kings
County presented Church, and Robinson and Beach held their friends
firmly in hand. With the skill of an astute leader, however, Tilden
weakened the support of Church by publishing his letters declining to
be a candidate, and by invoking the influences which emphasised the
division between Beach and Schell, gained Robinson for Kernan. The
audacity of such tactics staggered the opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.298" id="Page_iii.298">iii. 298</a></span> and when Beach
surrendered, Tammany and Kings hastened into line. This led to
Kernan's nomination by acclamation.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> As further evidence of
harmony Kelly moved the appointment of Tilden as a State
committeeman-at-large, and subsequently, on the organisation of the
committee, continued him as its chairman.</p>

<p>Both conventions endorsed the Cincinnati platform, denounced the
Legislature for its failure to expel dishonest members, and charged
the National Administration with corruption and favoritism. As a
farewell to the Governor, the Democrats resolved that &quot;the general
administration of John T. Hoffman meets the approbation of this
convention.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>Hoffman's political career closed under circumstances that a more
heroic soul might have avoided. In his last message he had repudiated
the Ring. He had also made some atonement by authorising such suits
against it as Charles O'Conor might advise,<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> and by vetoing the
Code Amendment Bill, devised by Cardozo and designed to confer
authority upon the judges to punish the press for attacking the Ring;
but the facts inspiring Nast's cartoon, which pictured him as the
Tammany wooden Indian on wheels, pushed and pulled by the Erie and
Tweed combination, had fixed the Governor in the popular mind as the
blind tool of rings. &quot;I saw him in 1885,&quot; says Rhodes, &quot;at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.299" id="Page_iii.299">iii. 299</a></span>
Schweizerhof in Lucerne. Accompanied by his wife he was driving
through Switzerland; and in this hotel, full of his own countrymen, he
sat neglected, probably shunned by many. The light was gone from his
eyes, the vigour from his body, the confidence from his manner;
consciousness of failure brooded in their stead. He had not become
dissipated. Great opportunities missed; this was the memory that
racked him, body and spirit, and left him nerveless and decrepit,
inviting death.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> He died in Germany in 1888.</p>

<p>For mayor of New York, John Kelly nominated Abram R. Lawrence, a
lawyer of ability and integrity, whom the Liberals endorsed. The
anti-Tammany forces, not yet willing to surrender to the new Boss,
divided their strength, the Apollo Hall Democracy nominating James
O'Brien, its founder, while the associations centring about the
Committee of Seventy supported William F. Havermeyer, whom the
Republicans endorsed. Havermeyer had twice been mayor.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> He
belonged among the enemies of jobbery, and although sixty-seven years
of age his mental and physical powers remained unimpaired. The
contest, thus narrowed to Lawrence and Havermeyer, assured a good
mayor.</p>

<p>The campaign opened encouragingly for Democrats and Liberals. &quot;The
antagonisms which civil war has created between the kindred
populations of our country,&quot; declared Tilden, in his speech at the
Syracuse convention, &quot;must be closed up now and forever.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> This
was the key-note of his party, and, apart from the personal question
of candidates, was the only serious issue of the campaign. In his
letter of acceptance Greeley added a new phrase to the vocabulary of
the common people: &quot;I accept your nomination,&quot; he said, &quot;in the
confident trust that the masses of our countrymen North and South are
eager to clasp hands across the bloody chasm.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.300" id="Page_iii.300">iii. 300</a></span></p><p>This was a taking cry, and as the great editor moved across
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, the general demonstration of interest
created considerable uneasiness at Republican headquarters. &quot;His name
had been honoured for so many years in every Republican household,&quot;
says Blaine, &quot;that the desire to see and hear him was universal, and
secured to him the majesty of numbers at every meeting.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Greeley's friends interpreted these vast audiences as indications of a
great tidal wave which would sweep Grant and his party from power. In
the latter part of September they confidently counted upon carrying
the October States. The South's endorsement of the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, its declaration that the public
credit must be sacredly maintained, and its denunciation of
repudiation in every form and guise, created the belief that the North
and South would, indeed, &quot;clasp hands across the bloody chasm.&quot;</p>

<p>In New York, however, although the Democratic leaders stood loyally by
their candidate, pushing Kernan boldly to the front wherever Greeley
seemed weak, the inequality of the fight was apparent. Tammany and
old-time Democrats could not forget that the <i>Tribune's</i> editor had
classed them with blacklegs, thieves, burglars, gamblers, and keepers
of dens of prostitution.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Moreover, only three Republican
newspapers had declared for Greeley,<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> while many leaders like
Lyman Tremaine and James W. Husted, whose criti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.301" id="Page_iii.301">iii. 301</a></span>cism of the President
had encouraged the belief that they would favour the Cincinnati
nominee, preferred Grant.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> Besides, the business men of the
country thought the Republican party without Greeley safer than the
Democratic party with Greeley.</p>

<p>After the Cincinnati convention a Republican Congress passed a General
Amnesty Act, approved May 22, and in the interest of &quot;a free breakfast
table&quot; placed tea and coffee on the free list. The reduction of the
public debt at the rate of one hundred millions a year, as well as
large annual reductions in the rate of taxation, also inspired
confidence, while to the President and his Secretary of State belonged
great credit for the Geneva arbitration. This amicable and dignified
adjustment of differences between England and the United States,
leading to new rules for the future government of Anglo-American
relations, and making impossible other than a friendly rivalry between
the two nations, sent a thrill of satisfaction through the American
people. Until then the settlement of such irritating questions had not
come by the peaceful process of law.</p>

<p>As the campaign progressed both sides indulged in bitter
personalities. In his Cooper Institute speech, an address of great
power, Conkling's invective and sarcasm cut as deeply as Nast's
cartoons.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Greeley's face, dress, and manners readily lent
themselves to caricature. &quot;I have been assailed so bitterly,&quot; wrote
Greeley, &quot;that I hardly knew whether I was running for President or
the Penitentiary.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> The <i>Tribune</i> told of a negro woman who was
heard cursing him in the streets of an Ohio river town because he had
&quot;sold her baby down South before the war.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Grant did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.302" id="Page_iii.302">iii. 302</a></span> not escape.
Indeed, he was lampooned until he declared that &quot;I have been the
subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equalled in political
history.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>Early elections increased Republican confidence. North Carolina, then
a doubtful State, gave a Republican majority in August.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Vermont
and Maine followed in September, and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana
practically settled the question in October. Finally, the election on
November 5 gave Greeley, by small majorities, Georgia, Kentucky,
Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas, or sixty-six electoral votes
to two hundred and seventy-two for Grant, whose popular majority
exceeded three-quarters of a million. Dix carried New York by 55,451
majority.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Of thirty-two congressmen the Republicans elected
twenty-three, with a legislative majority of seventy on joint ballot.
To the surprise of Tammany, Havermeyer was elected mayor by over 8,000
plurality, although Greeley carried the city by 23,000 majority.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
A comparison of the vote with that cast for Seymour in 1868 showed
that a marked percentage of Democrats refused to support Greeley, and
that a larger percent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.303" id="Page_iii.303">iii. 303</a></span>age did not vote at all.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> Other slights
added to his disappointment. &quot;I was an Abolitionist for years,&quot; he
said, &quot;when to be one was as much as one's life was worth even here in
New York, and the negroes have all voted against me. Whatever of
talents and energy I have possessed, I have freely contributed all my
life long to Protection; to the cause of our manufactures. And the
manufacturers have expended millions to defeat me. I even made myself
ridiculous in the opinion of many whose good wishes I desired, by
showing fair play and giving a fair field in the <i>Tribune</i> to Woman's
Rights; and the women have all gone against me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>Before the vote of the State was officially canvassed Greeley had gone
to his rest.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The campaign had overtaxed his strength, and upon
his return from the western speaking tour he watched at the bedside of
his wife until her decease on October 30. After the election he
resumed editorial charge of the <i>Tribune</i>, which he formally
relinquished on the 15th of the preceding May, but it was plain that
the robust animal spirits which characterised his former days were
gone.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> The loss of his wife, the mortification of defeat, the
financial embarrassment of his paper, and the exhaustion of his
physical powers had broken him. The announcement of his death,
however, although the public got an early intimation of the cruel work
which his troubles were making upon a frame that once seemed to be of
iron, came with the shock of sudden calamity. The whole country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.304" id="Page_iii.304">iii. 304</a></span>
recognised that in the field of his real conquests the most remarkable
man in American history had fallen, and it buried him with the
appreciation that attends a conqueror. At the funeral President Grant,
Vice-President Colfax, and the Vice-President-elect, Henry Wilson,
rode in the same carriage.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

21st.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> A few months later (November 8) the President, in
complimentary and generous terms, offered Conkling the place made
vacant by the death of Chief Justice Chase (May 7). His industry and
legal training admirably fitted him for the position, but for reasons
not specified he declined the distinguished preferment just as he had
refused in December, 1870, the offer of a law partnership with an
annual compensation of fifty thousand dollars. Probably the suggestion
that he become a presidential candidate influenced his decision,
especially as the President favoured his succession.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>At this time Conkling, then forty-four years old, may be said to have
reached the height of his power, if not of his fame. His opponents
were under his feet. Greeley was dead, Fenton's long and successful
career had closed in the gloom of defeat and the permanent eclipse of
his influence in public affairs, and others were weakened if not
destroyed by their party desertion. Moreover, the re-election of a
Presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.306" id="Page_iii.306">iii. 306</a></span>dent whom he had supported and defended with an opulent
vocabulary that made his studied addresses models of speech, continued
his political control. About half a dozen able lieutenants, holding
fat offices in the great patronage centres, revolved with the fidelity
of planets, while in every custom-house and federal office in the
State trained politicians performed the function of satellites. To
harness the party more securely hundreds of young men, selected from
the various counties because of their partisan zeal, filled the great
departments at Washington. &quot;In obedience to this system,&quot; said George
William Curtis, &quot;the whole machinery of the government is pulled to
pieces every four years. Political caucuses, primary meetings, and
conventions are controlled by the promise and expectation of
patronage. Political candidates for the lowest or highest positions
are directly or indirectly pledged. The pledge is the price of the
nomination, and when the election is determined, the pledges must be
redeemed. The business of the nation, the legislation of Congress, the
duties of the departments, are all subordinated to the distribution of
what is well called spoils.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>President Grant is quoted as declaring that the Senator never sought
an appointment from him.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> This statement is probably true, but not
on the theory of the Latin maxim, <i>Qui facit per alium, facit per
se</i>.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> No occasion existed for him to make requests since his
agents, well known to the President, cabinet, and collectors, could
obtain the necessary appointments without the Senator's participation
or even knowledge. Nevertheless, he relied upon public patronage as an
instrument of party and factional success, and uniformly employed it
throughout his career. The principal objection of the independent
press to his appointment as chief justice implied his devotion to
practical politics and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.307" id="Page_iii.307">iii. 307</a></span> an absence of the quality of true
statesmanship.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Indeed, in spite of his transcendent gifts, his
hold upon party and people was never stronger than the machine's,
since the influence of his control tended to transform political
action into such subserviency that men of spirit, though loving their
party, frequently held aloof from its service.</p>

<p>But Conkling used only the methods inherited with his leadership, and
to all appearances the grasp of the Republican party in New York in
January, 1873, was as firm as the most ardent partisan could desire.
This feeling controlled the State convention at Utica on September 24
to such a degree that its action resembled the partisan narrowness of
a ward caucus. Conkling did not attend, but his lieutenants, evidently
considering the party vote as a force which only needed exhortation or
intimidation to bring out, dropped Barlow, the attorney-general,
without the slightest regard to public sentiment, and visited the
penalty of party treason upon Thomas Raines, the State treasurer, for
his support of Greeley. From a party viewpoint perhaps Raines deserved
such treatment, but Francis C. Barlow's conduct of his office had been
characterised by the superb daring with which he met the dangers and
difficulties of many battlefields, making him the connecting link
between his party and the Reform movement. He had prosecuted the Erie
spoilers, and was then engaged in securing the punishment of the
Tammany ring. O'Conor spoke of his &quot;austere integrity&quot; in refusing to
accept millions as a compromise.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> Moreover it was conceded that
Barlow, with the possible exception of Tilden and O'Conor, knew more
of the canal frauds than any one in the State. The list of suits
brought by him showed the rottenness of the whole system of canal
management, while a recent letter, denouncing a leader of the Ring,
did not veil his hostility to its individual members.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> This
attack, boldly directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.308" id="Page_iii.308">iii. 308</a></span> against a prominent Republican, aroused the
fierce opposition of the contract manipulators, whose influence
sufficed not only to defeat him, but to nominate the very man he had
accused.</p>

<p>To add to its shame the party in New York City made a bargain with
Apollo Hall, an organisation gotten up by James O'Brien, the
ex-sheriff, for the purpose of selling to the highest bidder. In 1871
by skilful man&#339;uvres the party freed itself from any suspicion of
an alliance with this faction, and had thus to a very great extent
obtained the direction of the Reform movement; but now, by dropping
Barlow, ignoring his disclosures, and accepting O'Brien's offer,
already rejected by Tammany with contempt, it sacrificed its hold upon
the solid part of the community which had been taught that a vote for
the Republican ticket was the only way to obtain the fruits of
reform.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>At the Democratic convention which met in Utica on October 1, Thomas
Raines, whose adhesion to Greeley had made him a martyr, was nominated
by acclamation. Here, however, the enthusiasm ended. The overwhelming
defeat of the previous year had sapped the party of confidence, and
candidates whom the convention desired refused to accept, while those
it nominated brought neither prominence nor strength.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> The
platform denounced the &quot;salary grab,&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.309" id="Page_iii.309">iii. 309</a></span> passed in the closing hours of
the last Congress, and condemned the Cr&#233;dit Mobilier disclosures which
had recently startled the country and disgraced Congress.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Through
its executive committee the Liberal party indorsed the Democratic
nominees except for comptroller and prison inspector. For these
offices it preferred the Republicans' choice of Hopkins and Platt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the financial crash which began on September 18 by the
failure of Jay Cooke &amp; Co., spread an intense gloom over the State as
well as the country, and although by the middle of October the panic,
properly defined, had ended, a commercial crisis continued. By
November 1 several railroads had defaulted in the payment of interest
on their bonds, cotton and iron mills had closed, and many labourers
were thrown out of employment. Criticism of the Administration's
financial policy naturally followed, and men whose purchasing power
had ceased turned against the Republicans, giving the State to the
Democrats by 10,000 majority. With the aid of the Liberals, Hopkins
and Platt received about 4,000 majority. On the question of electing
or appointing judges, the people by an overwhelming vote pronounced in
favour of election.</p>

<p>As in other &quot;off years&quot; the result of this contest indicated a general
drift of political opinion. Ever since the Republican party came into
power ebbs and flows had occurred at alternating biennial periods. A
Democratic revival in 1862 followed Lincoln's election in 1860; his
re-election in 1864 saw a similar revival in 1865; and Grant's
decisive vote in 1868 brought a conservative reaction in 1870. It was
perhaps natural to expect that after the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.310" id="Page_iii.310">iii. 310</a></span> re-election in
1872 something of the kind would happen in 1873. Nevertheless, Samuel
J. Tilden saw in the result something more than the usual reaction. He
believed the failure of the Republicans to associate themselves
intimately with reformers and to manifest a loathing for all corrupt
alliances, had added greatly to their burden, and early in the summer
of 1874 he determined to run for governor.</p>

<p>On his return from Europe in the early fall of 1873 Tilden had found
thoughtful men of both parties talking of him as a successor to Dix.
To them the trials of Tweed and his confederates made it plain that
substantial reform must begin at Albany, and they wanted a man whose
experience and success in dealing with one Ring rendered it certain
that he would assault and carry the works of the other. But Tilden was
cunning. He betrayed no evidence of his desire until others confessed
their unwillingness to take the nomination. To the average
office-seeker running against Dix and his plurality of 55,000 was not
an attractive race. Meanwhile John Kelly, realising the value of
appearing honest, indicated a preference for Tilden.</p>

<p>There was something magnetic about the suggestion. Tilden was able,
rich, and known to everybody as the foe of the Tweed ring. Besides he
was capable, notwithstanding his infirmity, of making a forceful
speech, full of fire, logic and facts, his quick, retentive memory
enabling him to enter easily into political controversy. As a powerful
reasoner it was admitted that he had few equals at the bar. Indeed,
the press, crediting him with courage, perseverance, and indomitable
industry, had pictured him as a successful leader and an ideal
reformer. Tilden himself believed in his destiny, and when, at last,
the time seemed ripe to avow his candidacy he carried on a canvass
which for skill, knowledge of human nature, and of the ins and outs of
politics, had rarely been approached by any preceding master. The
press of the State soon reflected the growing sentiment in his favour.
&quot;In selecting him,&quot; said George William Curtis, &quot;the party will
designate one of its most reputable mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.311" id="Page_iii.311">iii. 311</a></span>bers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> The New York
<i>Times</i> spoke of him as a &quot;man of unsullied honour,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> and the
<i>Tribune</i> declared that &quot;his career in office, should he be elected,
would be distinguished alike by integrity, decorum, administrative
ability, and shrewd political management.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>As one county after another instructed its delegates for Tilden,
professional politicians exhibited much astonishment. To the Canal
ring the trend of public sentiment toward a man of his record and
independence was especially ominous. Suddenly, such violent opposition
appeared that the New York <i>Herald</i>, studying the Democratic papers in
the State, declared that outside of New York City only the Utica
<i>Observer</i>, which was influenced by Kernan, favoured his
nomination.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> It was openly charged that selfish ambition prompted
his prosecution of the Tweed frauds, and that he was a cunning
schemer, cold, reticent, and severe. Then men began to dissuade him.
Friends counselled him not to take the risk of a nominating
convention. Even Seymour, moved perhaps by ambitions of his own,
discouraged him. If nominated, he wrote, you must expect the martyr's
crown. &quot;There has been a widespread plan to carry the convention
against you. It was started last winter, and it shaped laws and
appointments. The State officers are against you.... You will find the
same combination at Syracuse that controlled at Rochester in 1871....
Our people want men in office who will not steal, but who will not
interfere with those who do.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Coupled with this opposition was
the suggestion that Sanford E. Church, being in no wise identified
with the Ring prosecutions, would make a more available candidate.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year Church, in an interview with Tilden, had declined
to become a candidate, but afterward, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.312" id="Page_iii.312">iii. 312</a></span> 1872, he grew anxious for
the honour, and finally gave Joseph Warren of the Buffalo <i>Courier</i> a
written consent to accept if nominated with the concurrence of other
candidates.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Armed with this statement and with letters of
withdrawal from others associated with the gubernatorial nomination,
Warren sought Tilden with confidence. By prearrangement their meeting
occurred on September 8 at the Delavan House in Albany. Several were
present&#8212;Jarvis Lord, a senator from Rochester and an extensive canal
contractor, DeWolf of Oswego, and other canal men. In the room
adjoining Reuben E. Fenton waited.</p>

<p>Tilden was not surprised at the latter's presence. He knew that in the
event of his withdrawal, Fenton intended that the Liberals should
nominate Church at their convention which assembled in Albany two days
later.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> But Tilden, long familiar with the Ring's methods, refused
to withdraw. On no theory could they make it appear to be his duty,
and the longer they talked the more determined he became. Then John
Kelly, in a published interview, gave Church's aspiration its death
blow. &quot;DeWolf of Oswego, Warren of Erie, and Senator Lord of Monroe,&quot;
he said, &quot;belong to what is called the Canal ring.... It has been
their policy to control a majority of the canal board to enable them
to control the canal contracts.... They have always been very friendly
to Judge Church and of great assistance to him personally.... There
was friendship existing between the old Tammany ring and this Canal
ring.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> John Bigelow, the friend of Tilden, subsequently used
stronger phrases. &quot;Tilden knew the Canal ring had no more servile
instrument in the State than the candidate they were urging. Church
was poor; he was ambitious; he was not content with his place on the
bench, and was only too ready at all times to combine with anybody on
any terms to se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.313" id="Page_iii.313">iii. 313</a></span>cure wealth and power.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> To Kelly's charges the
Buffalo <i>Courier</i> retorted that &quot;Tammany Hall under honest John Kelly
is exactly the same as Tammany Hall under dishonest William M.
Tweed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>When the Democratic State convention met a week later war existed
between Kelly and the Canal ring.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> Warren intensified it by giving
the Syracuse <i>Standard</i> a despatch declaring that Kelly's robberies
while sheriff were as criminal as those of Garvey's and Ingersoll's of
the Tweed ring.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> In the furious assault upon Tilden no reasons
appeared other than the fear of the Canal ring that his administration
would lead to its discomfiture. Indeed, the flankers of the reform
movement found it difficult to agree upon a candidate, and when Amasa
J. Parker finally consented to stand he did so to gratify Church's
friends in the middle and western portions of the State, who resented
the Kelly interview. That the bad blood between the Warren and Kelly
factions did not break out in the convention was probably due to
Seymour's conciliatory, tactful remarks. A single ballot, however,
banished the thought of setting Tilden aside for some man less
obnoxious to the Ring.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>The convention was not less fortunate in its selection of William
Dorsheimer of Buffalo for lieutenant-governor. Many delegates,
desiring a Democrat who would inspire enthusiasm among the younger
men, preferred Smith M. Weed of Clinton, resourceful and brilliant, if
unembarrassed by methods; but he succumbed to the earnest appeals of
DeWitt C. Littlejohn in behalf of Liberal recognition.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Dorsheimer
possessed almost all the qualities that go to make up suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.314" id="Page_iii.314">iii. 314</a></span>cess in
politics. He had courage and tact, fascination and audacity, rare
skill on the platform, creditable associations, and marked literary
attainments. Moreover, he had given up a United States attorneyship to
follow Greeley.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Not less helpful was the platform, drafted by
Seymour, which abounded in short, clear, compact statements, without
buncombe or the least equivocation. It demanded the payment of the
public debt in coin, the resumption of specie payment, taxation for
revenue only, local self-government, and State supervision of
corporations. It also denounced sumptuary laws and the third term.</p>

<p>Although John Kelly aided in nominating Tilden, his desire for
anti-ring candidates did not extend to the metropolis. William F.
Havermeyer's sudden death in November made necessary the election of a
mayor, and Kelly, to keep up appearances, selected William H. Wickham,
his neighbour, an easy-going diamond merchant, whose membership on the
Committee of Seventy constituted his only claim to such
preferment.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> But here all semblance of reform disappeared. James
Hayes, charged with making half a million dollars during the Tweed
r&#233;gime, became the candidate for register, and of fifteen persons
selected for aldermen nine belonged to the old Ring, two of whom were
under indictment for fraud.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> Evidently Warren did not betray
ignorance when he pronounced the new Tammany no better than the old.
The Republicans presented Salem H. Wales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.315" id="Page_iii.315">iii. 315</a></span> for mayor, while the
Germans, declining to act with Kelly, selected Oswald Ottendorfer, the
editor, a most able and upright citizen who had proven his fidelity to
the reform movement.</p>

<p>The Republicans renominated John A. Dix with other State officials
elected in 1872,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> and had the Custom-house sincerely desired the
Governor's re-election, the expediency of a coalition with
Ottendorfer's supporters must have appealed to it as highly important.
Dix had made an admirable executive. His decisions of questions
regardless of men and of the next election excited popular confidence,
and the power of public opinion had forced his renomination by
acclamation. But his independence could not be forgiven. Moreover, the
platform gave him little assistance. It neither denounced corruption,
demanded relief from predatory rings, nor disapproved a third term.
Except as to resumption and the payment of the public debt in coin, it
followed the beaten track of its predecessors, spending itself over
Southern outrages. Although several delegates had prepared resolutions
in opposition to a third term, no one dared present them after
Conkling had finished his eulogy of the President.</p>

<p>The Liberals who assembled at Albany on September 10 had about
finished their course as a separate party. Their creed, so far as it
represented practical, well-meditated reform, was a respectable,
healthy faith, but the magnet which attracted the coterie of
Republicans whose leadership gave it whatever influence it exerted in
the Empire State was Horace Greeley. When he died their activity
ceased. Besides, the renomination of Dix, who had little liking for
the organisation and no sympathy with a third term, now afforded them
good opportunity to return to the fold. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.316" id="Page_iii.316">iii. 316</a></span> Albany convention,
therefore, represented only a small fraction of the original
dissenters, and these adjourned without action until the 29th. On
reconvening a long, acrimonious discussion indicated a strong
disposition to run to cover. Some favoured Tilden, others Dix, but
finally, under the lead of George W. Palmer, the convention, deciding
to endorse no one, resolved to support men of approved honesty, who
represented the principles of the Cincinnati convention and opposed a
third term.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>As the days shortened the campaign became more spirited. Tilden,
putting himself in close relation with every school district in the
State, introduced the clever device of mailing a fac-simile of one of
his communications, thus flattering the receiver with the belief that
he possessed an autograph letter. His genius for detail kept a corps
of assistants busy, and the effort to inspire his desponding partisans
with hope of success made each correspondent the centre of an earnest
band of endeavourers. Meanwhile the Democratic press kept up a galling
fire of criticism. Dix had escaped in 1872, but now the newspapers
charged him with nepotism and extravagance. &quot;Governor Morgan had two
aides in time of war,&quot; wrote Seymour, &quot;while Dix has six in time of
peace. Morgan had one messenger, Dix has two. Morgan had a secretary
at $2,000; Dix had the pay put up to $3,500&#8212;and then appointed his
son.... The people think the Governor gets $4,000; in fact, under
different pretexts it is made $14,000.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> An attempt was also made
to connect him with the Cr&#233;dit Mobilier scandal because of his
presidency of the Union Pacific road at the time of the consideration
of the Oakes Ames contract.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.317" id="Page_iii.317">iii. 317</a></span> That the Governor had no interest in
or connection with the construction company availed him little. Other
men of approved honesty had become involved in the back-salary grab,
the Sanborn claims, and the Cr&#233;dit Mobilier, and the people, quickly
distrusting any one accused, classed him with the wrong-doers.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dix laboured under the disadvantage of having apathetic
party managers. &quot;They deliberately refused to support him,&quot; said his
son, &quot;preferring defeat to the re-election of one whom they desired to
be rid of.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Conkling, in his speech at Brooklyn,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> rebuked the
spirit of calumny that assails the character of public men, but he
neglected to extol the record of a patriotic Governor, or to speak the
word against a third term which would have materially lightened the
party burden.</p>

<p>When the opposition press began its agitation of a third term,
charging that the country was &quot;drifting upon the rock of
C&#230;sarism,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> few men believed such an idea sincerely entertained.
Nevertheless, as the election approached it aroused popular
solicitude. Congressmen who hurried to Washington in the hope of being
authorised to contradict the accusation, returned without an utterance
to disarm their opponents, while the Democrats not only maintained
that Grant himself was not averse to using his official position to
secure the nomination, but that eighty thousand office-holders were
plotting for this end.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> As the idea had its inception largely in
the talk of a coterie of Grant's political and personal friends,
Conkling's eulogies of the President seemed to corroborate the claim.
So plainly did the <i>Times</i> stagger under the load that rumours of the
<i>Tribune's</i> becoming a Conkling organ reached the <i>Nation</i>.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> It
could not be denied that next to the commercial depression and the
insolence of the Canal ring, the deep-seated dissatisfaction with
Grant's administration influenced public senti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.318" id="Page_iii.318">iii. 318</a></span>ment. Excluding the
inflation veto the record of his second term had not improved upon the
first, while to many his refusal to disclaim the third-term accusation
became intolerable.</p>

<p>The municipal contest in New York City also developed embarrassments.
Barring a few appointments Havermeyer had made a fair record, having
improved the public school system, kept clean streets, and paid much
attention to sanitary conditions. Moreover, he distributed the revenue
with care, and by the practice of economy in the public works reduced
expenses nearly eight millions. The winter of 1873-4 proved a severe
one for the unemployed, however, and to catch their votes Kelly, with
great adroitness, favoured giving them public employment. This was a
powerful appeal. Fifteen thousand idle mechanics in the city wanted
work more than public economy, while thousands in the poorer
districts, seeking and receiving food from Tammany, cheered the
turbulent orator as he pictured the suffering due to Havermeyer's
policy and the hope inspired by Kelly's promises.</p>

<p>Havermeyer's accusations against Kelly also recoiled upon his party.
In the course of a bitter quarrel growing out of Kelly's appointment
of Richard Croker as marshal,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> the Mayor publicly charged &quot;Honest
John&quot; with obtaining while sheriff $84,482 by other than legal
methods.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> &quot;I think,&quot; said Havermeyer, &quot;you were worse than Tweed
who made no pretensions to purity, while you avow your honesty and
wrap yourself in the mantle of purity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.319" id="Page_iii.319">iii. 319</a></span> Kelly's prompt denial,
followed by a suit for criminal libel, showed a willingness to try the
issue, but Havermeyer's sudden death from apoplexy on the morning of
the trial (November 30), leaving his proofs unpublished, strengthened
Kelly's claim that &quot;Tammany is the only reform party in existence here
to-day.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>The Republican press, apparently with effect, enlarged upon the
general excellence of Dix's administration, but early in the campaign
the people showed greater liking for reform at home than abhorrence of
outrages in the South, and the result proved a political revolution,
Tilden receiving a plurality of 50,317 and Dorsheimer 51,488.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
Besides the State ticket the Democrats carried the Assembly and
eighteen of the thirty-three congressional districts. With the
exception of James Hayes, who was defeated for register by over 10,000
majority, Tammany likewise elected its entire ticket.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>Democratic success was not confined to New York. Small majorities were
obtained in Ohio and Indiana as well as in Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, and for the first time since 1861 the House of
Representatives passed into the control of that party. The financial
depression plainly operated to the great advantage of the Democrats,
but in allowing Tilden to pre-empt the reform issue when men were
intent upon smashing rings, the Republicans opened the door for their
destruction. &quot;They [the Republican leaders] have apparently believed
the people would submit to anything and everything,&quot; said the <i>Times</i>,
&quot;and that the party was indestructible. If a newspaper warned them in
a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.320" id="Page_iii.320">iii. 320</a></span> but firm spirit against the policy of blundering, it was
treated with a mixture of the insolence and arrogance which they
exhibited toward all opposition.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<h2>RIVALRY OF TILDEN AND CONKLING</h2>

<h2>1875</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">If</span> further evidence of Tilden's supremacy in his party were needed,
the election of Francis Kernan to the United States Senate furnished
it. It had been nearly thirty years since the Democrats of New York
were represented in the Senate, and Tilden sent his staunchest
supporter to take the place of Fenton.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> This fidelity disturbed
the members of the Canal ring, who now anxiously awaited the
development of the Governor's policy. The overthrow of the Tammany
ring and the memory of Tweed's fate hung about them like the shadow of
a great fear.</p>

<p>Tilden did not strike at once. Treating the matter as he did the Tweed
disclosures, he secretly studied the methods of the Ring, examined
more than one hundred contracts, and employed a civil engineer to
verify work paid for with that actually done. So severe was the strain
of this labour that in February he suffered a cerebral attack nearly
akin to paralysis.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Of the character or purpose of his work no one
had any intimation, and guilty men who obsequiously complimented him
thought him weak and without the nerve to harm them. But on the 18th
of March (1875) he thrilled the State and chilled the Ring with a
special message to the Legislature, showing that for the five years
ending September 30, 1874, millions had been wasted because of
unnecessary repairs and corrupt contracts. Upon ten of these
fraudulent contracts the State, it appeared, had paid more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.322" id="Page_iii.322">iii. 322</a></span> than a
million and a half, while the proposals at contract prices called for
less than half a million. This result, he said in substance, was
brought about by a unique contrivance. The engineer designated the
quantity and kinds of work to be done, and when these estimates were
published by the commissioners, the favoured contractor, learning
through collusion what materials would actually be required, bid
absurdly low prices for some and unreasonably high rates for others.
After the contract was let, changes made in accordance with the
previous secret understanding required only the higher priced
materials. Thus the contractor secured the work without competition or
real public letting.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>The Governor recommended various measures of reform, notably a new
letting after any change in the proposals for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.323" id="Page_iii.323">iii. 323</a></span> bids. He also suggested
an investigation of the frauds already perpetrated, and for this
purpose the Senate confirmed a non-partisan commission,<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> who
quickly reported that the work of one contractor showed fraudulent
estimates, false measurements, and a charge of $150,337.02 for
excavations and embankments that were never made. Neither surveys nor
estimates preceded the letting of the contract, while in every
instance he appeared as the lowest bidder. Eleven additional reports
made during the year showed that similar frauds were repeatedly
practised by him and other contractors. In each case arrests,
indictments, and suits for restitution promptly followed.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> It also
appeared that the auditor of the canal department, a former Republican
candidate for secretary of state, had made use of his office to
speculate in canal drafts and certificates.</p>

<p>The excitement over these revelations recalled the indignation
following the Tweed disclosures. Every voter in every corner of the
State knew of them. Furthermore, the arrests of contractors and
officials along the line of the canal multiplied evidence of the
Governor's courage. He spared no one. Of the principal officials and
ex-officials indicted all save two were Democrats,<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> but his
administration knew no party and expressed no concern. Such creditable
public service made a profound impression, and during a visit to the
western part of the State in August, the people accorded him the
attention given to a conqueror. From Albany to Buffalo crowds
everywhere saluted him with bands of music and salvos of artillery,
while his addresses, charac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.324" id="Page_iii.324">iii. 324</a></span>terised by plainness of speech, deprecated
a reactionary policy.</p>

<p>These demonstrations alarmed Republican leaders. They appreciated that
his adroitness and energy in accumulating proof of Tweed's guilt had
fixed the attention of the country upon him as a presidential
candidate, and that the assault on the canal spoilers made his
pretensions more formidable. Moreover, they realised that their own
failure to lead in canal reform in 1873, evidenced by ignoring Barlow
and his incriminating disclosures, yielded Tilden a decided advantage
of which he must be dispossessed. To accomplish this two ways opened
to them. Regarding the canal scandal as not a party question they
could heartily join him in the crusade, thus dividing whatever
political capital might be made out of it; or they could disparage his
effort and belittle his character as a reformer. The latter being the
easier because the more tolerable, many Republican papers began
charging him with insincerity, with trickery, and with being wholly
influenced by political aspirations. His methods, too, were criticised
as undiplomatic, hasty, and often harsh. Of this policy <i>Harper's
Weekly</i> said: &quot;Those who say that the Governor's action is a mere
political trick, and that he means nothing, evidently forget that they
are speaking of the man who, when he once took hold of the Tweed
prosecution, joined in pushing it relentlessly to the end.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>This was the sentiment of George William Curtis, who presided at the
Republican State convention.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> It also became the policy of the
managers whom defeat had chastened. They discerned the signs of the
times, and instead of repressing hostility to a third term and
dissatisfaction with certain tendencies of the National
administration, as had been done in 1874, they deemed it wiser to swim
with the current, meeting new influences and conditions by discarding
old policies that had brought their party into peril. The delegates,
therefore, by a great majority, favoured &quot;a just, gener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.325" id="Page_iii.325">iii. 325</a></span>ous, and
forbearing national policy in the South,&quot; and &quot;a firm refusal to use
military power, except for purposes clearly defined in the
Constitution.&quot; They also commended &quot;honest efforts for the correction
of public abuses,&quot; pledged co&#246;peration &quot;in every honourable way to
secure pure government and to bring offenders to justice,&quot; and
declared &quot;unalterable opposition to the election of any President for
a third term.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Furthermore, the convention sought candidates of
prominence and approved integrity. In the presence of threatened
defeat such men were shy. William H. Robertson of Westchester thrice
declined the comptrollership, and insistence upon his acceptance did
not cease until James W. Husted, springing to his feet, declared that
such demands were evidently intended as an insult. Then Edwin D.
Morgan proposed George R. Babcock, a distinguished lawyer of Buffalo,
who likewise declined. In a short, crisp letter, John Bigelow,
chairman of the canal investigating committee, rejected the proffered
honour. Finally, the choice fell upon Francis E. Spinner, formerly
United States treasurer, and although he sent two unconsenting
telegrams, the convention refused to revoke its action. Despite such
embarrassments, however, it secured an array of strong, clean
men.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>A week later the Democrats assembled at Syracuse. They quickly retired
an anti-Tammany delegation led by John Morrissey,<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> reaffirmed the
platforms of 1872 and 1874, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.326" id="Page_iii.326">iii. 326</a></span> nominated John Bigelow for secretary
of state. Bigelow, well known as a former editor of the <i>Evening Post</i>
and more recently minister to France, had always been a Republican.
Indeed, Tilden named and a Republican Senate confirmed him as one of
two Republicans on a non-partisan board; but for reasons best known to
himself Bigelow changed his party in the twinkling of an eye.
Associated with him were John D. Van Buren, also upon the canal
commission; Lucius Robinson, who won, when comptroller in 1862, great
honour in the teeth of much obloquy by paying the State interest in
coin; and Charles S. Fairchild, then a young lawyer earning
substantial credit, like Bigelow and Van Buren, in the prosecution of
the Canal ring.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> In naming this ticket Tilden had exhibited his
characteristic shrewdness. He exaggerated the partisan aspect of
administrative reform, and strengthened his candidacy for President by
appropriating the glory.</p>

<p>The Republican press, quickly interpreting his purpose, now changed
from praise to censure, scrutinising and criticising every act in his
long public career. It reviewed his war record, disclosed his part in
the convention of 1864, and hinted at uncanny financial transactions.
His service as the figure-head of Tweed's conventions, and his
passiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.327" id="Page_iii.327">iii. 327</a></span> after possessing knowledge of the infamous circular of
1868 to which his name had been forged, also became the subject of
severe censure. Though he neither shared Tweed's corrupt counsels nor
sanctioned his audacious schemes, Tilden's abhorrence of wrong, it was
argued, seemed insufficient to break his silence. But the accusation
that cut the deepest, because without palliation, illuminated his
declination to attend the great indignation meeting that appointed the
Committee of Seventy. This fact, established by abundant proof as well
as by his conspicuous absence, created the belief that had the
<i>Times'</i> exposure failed fatally to wound the Ring, he would have
shrunk from defying Tweed.</p>

<p>In the presence of such a record it was ludicrous to deny that Tilden,
although resembling a reformer, was simply an adroit politician, who
had cultivated some queer political associates and had countenanced
some very shady transactions. Nevertheless, Tilden would not be
diverted from the singleness of his purpose. To make the issue a
personal one he took the stump and traversed the State from one end to
the other, always addressing immense crowds. At Utica the contemporary
press estimated the throng at twenty-five thousand persons. With
directness and business brevity he sought to arouse the people to the
importance and gravity of the issues at stake. &quot;To-day about one-half
of the tax contributed by the farmer,&quot; he said, &quot;goes to the State to
carry on public affairs.... It is in the power of the Legislature and
the Executive at Albany to reduce this State tax one-half if you send
the right men.... We began this work last winter. It made great
conflict and turmoil, the attempt to remove the fungus-growths which
had sprung up all over our State institutions, and which were
smothering their vitality.... It is not alone the saving of dollars
and cents, for you cannot preserve your present system of government
unless you purify administration and purify legislation.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.328" id="Page_iii.328">iii. 328</a></span></p>
<p>During the anti-slavery struggle Tilden's incapacity to measure the
moral force of public sentiment had undoubtedly kept him in error. He
failed entirely to appreciate the close connection between rebellion
and slavery, and in finally yielding to the war-failure resolution at
Chicago in 1864 he did not realise how completely abolition and a
restoration of the Union were associated in the hearts of the people.
But with the advent of the business period, although his bodily
presence was weak and the external elements of popularity were
wanting, his subtle, strong mind and great administrative capacity
brought him irresistibly to the front, and his shrewd, homely appeals,
without mixed metaphors or partisan allusions, reduced the issue of
the campaign to the attractive one of saving dollars and cents by
protecting the treasury against the raid of canal spoilers.</p>

<p>Conkling did not attend the Saratoga convention.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> But he did not
remain silent during the campaign. The Democratic and independent
press, illuminating the story of Louisiana under carpet-bag-negro rule
which culminated in the ejection of members of the Legislature by a
file of soldiers under command of General Sheridan, had greatly
increased the disfavour of the Administration's policy toward the
South.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> So intense had been the excitement following the
publication of Sheridan's despatches that a great indignation meeting
called out William Cullen Bryant, then past eighty, who addressed it
&quot;with the vehemence and fire of a man of thirty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> Moreover, the
exposure of the Whiskey ring which began under Bristow, then secretary
of the treasury, added to the advantage of the Democrats. The chief
conspirator figured as Grant's most generous gift-giver, who claimed
collusion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.329" id="Page_iii.329">iii. 329</a></span> the President's private secretary. The Executive's
evident displeasure with Bristow also increased the unrest. Indeed, it
seemed a period of exposure. Public opinion had become aroused and
inflamed. &quot;Great as are the frauds of Tammany,&quot; said Charles A. Dana,
&quot;they sink into insignificance not only beside those of the carpet-bag
governments of the South, but still more beside those committed by the
Republican Administration at Washington.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>These revelations, however, did not call more loudly for Conkling's
defence of his party than did the popular applause which everywhere
greeted the reform Governor. The work and rising fame of Tilden
alarmed the Senator if it did not irritate him. He saw the tremendous
throng at Utica; he had read the plain, brief, unadorned statement
about dividing the State-tax by two; and he recognised a rival who had
leaped into the political arena full-armed and eager. Moreover,
Conkling was himself a candidate for President. Grant's letter of May
29,<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> interpreted as a declination to be a candidate for a third
term, set him free to enter the lists, and the argument of his
availability, based upon his power to carry the pivotal State, made a
Republican victory in 1875 of the highest importance. For him to take
part in the campaign, therefore, was imperative, and he selected
Albany as the place and October 13 as the day to begin. Other
engagements followed at Buffalo, Utica, New York, and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Attracted by the critical situation and an intense curiosity great
audiences greeted him, and hundreds of friends cheered an address,
which, as usual, contained from his point of view the whole Republican
case. He recited the Democratic party's history during the war;
described reformers as selfish, hypocritical, and pure, placing
Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.330" id="Page_iii.330">iii. 330</a></span>publicans in the last category; claimed that the canal frauds
originated under Democratic rule and were connived at by Democratic
State officials; and proved that Republicans had administered the
canals and the State's finances more economically than the Democrats.
He also admitted reform to be the principal issue, thanked Tilden for
the little he had accomplished, severely castigated Bigelow for
accepting place on the canal commission as a Republican and on the
State ticket as a Democrat, and drew attention to Kelly as a bad man
and to the extravagance of Democratic rule in New York City.
Throughout it all his treatment was characteristically bold,
brilliant, and aggressive. &quot;The bright blade of his eloquence with its
keen satiric edge flashed defiantly before the eyes of the applauding
audience,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and every period exhibited his profound sense of the
duty of maintaining the ascendency of a party which to him promised
best for the public.</p>

<p>With wisdom and sound argument Conkling had opposed inflation, and
after the passage of the bill on April 14, 1874, he had encouraged the
President's veto. He had likewise advocated with no less fervour and
sagacity the resumption of specie payment, which became a law on
January 14, 1875. This service justly entitled him to the highest
praise. Nevertheless, in his speech at Albany he failed to show that
Republican success in 1875 would not mean a continuation of those
things which helped a Republican defeat in 1874. Hostility to a third
term and sympathy with a generous Southern policy were the conspicuous
features of the Saratoga platform, and upon these issues he maintained
a notable silence. His address was rather an appeal to the past&#8212;not
an inspiring assurance for the future, seeking pure administration. Of
his personal honesty no one entertained a doubt, but for party ends he
had failed to use his opportunities in exposing and correcting abuses.
To him the country under Republican rule, whatever its shortcomings,
was in the safest hands, and he ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.331" id="Page_iii.331">iii. 331</a></span>hibited no sympathy with those
whose great love for their party made them long to have it stand for
civic righteousness, regardless of whom it might destroy.</p>

<p>As the campaign grew older Republicans cherished the hope of victory.
The break between Kelly and Morrissey had led to the formation of the
Irving Hall Democracy. In this organisation all anti-Tammany elements
found a home, and to test its strength Morrissey declared himself a
candidate for the Senate in the fourth or old Tweed district, which
usually recorded eleven thousand majority for Tammany. The Republicans
promptly endorsed the nomination. This challenge had turned the whole
city into turmoil. Morrissey's audacity in selecting the invincible
stronghold of Tammany for his field of battle, throwing the glamour of
a gloveless ring-contest over the struggle, brought into life all the
concomitants of such a bout. Kelly, leaving his uptown home,
personally led the Tammany forces, and on election day the paralytic,
the maimed, and men feeble from sickness were brought to the polls.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the votes were counted Morrissey proved the winner.
Indeed, to the chagrin of Kelly and the alarm of the Democrats,
Tammany candidates had fallen in every part of the city, their
overthrow encouraging the belief that the State had been carried by
the Republicans. Subsequently, when Bigelow's plurality of nearly
fifteen thousand was established, it made defeat doubly
disheartening.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> It put Tilden on a pinnacle. It left Conkling on
the ground.</p>

<h2>DEFEAT OF THE REPUBLICAN MACHINE</h2>

<h2>1876</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Much</span> discussion of Conkling's candidacy for President followed the
defeat of his party in 1875. The Union League Club, a body of earnest
Republicans and generous campaign givers, declared for pure government
and a reforming Executive. Several county conventions voiced a protest
against pledged delegations, and <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, in order to divide
Republicans more sharply into Conkling and anti-Conkling advocates,
suggested, in a series of aggressive editorials, that a reform
Democrat might be preferable to a Republican who represented the low
tone of political honour and morality which exposed itself in official
life. On the assembling of the State convention (March 22) to select
delegates to Cincinnati, Curtis opened the way wider for a determined
struggle. &quot;The unceasing disposition of the officers and agents of the
Administration to prostitute the party organisations relentlessly and
at all costs to personal ends,&quot; he said, &quot;has everywhere aroused the
apprehension of the friends of free government, and has startled and
alarmed the honest masses of the Republican party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> This shot
fired across the bow of the organisation brought its head into the
wind.</p>

<p>The Conkling managers had secured a majority of the delegates, whose
desire to advertise an undivided sentiment for the Senator in New York
manifested itself by a willingness to yield in the interest of
harmony. Finally, their resolution to instruct the delegation to vote
as a unit took the more modest form of simply presenting &quot;Roscoe
Conk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.333" id="Page_iii.333">iii. 333</a></span>ling as our choice for the nomination of President.&quot; Curtis,
refusing his assent, moved a substitute that left the selection of a
candidate to the patriotic wisdom of the National convention &quot;in full
confidence that it will present the name of some tried and true
Republican whose character and career are the pledge of a pure,
economical, and vigorous administration of the government.&quot; This was
an issue&#8212;not a compromise. It practically put Conkling out of the
race, and after its presentation nothing remained to be done except to
call the roll. At its completion the startling discovery was made that
of the 432 delegates present only 363 had answered, and that of these
113 had boldly stood with Curtis. Equally impressive, too, was the
silence of the 69 who refrained from voting. Thus it appeared that,
after the whole office-holding power had worked for weeks to secure
delegates, only 33 more than a majority favoured even the presentation
of Conkling's name. It was recalled by way of contrast that in 1860,
Seward, without an office at his command, had led the united
Republican enthusiasm of the State.</p>

<p>Following the example of Seward's supporters at Chicago, the friends
of Conkling at Cincinnati occupied an entire hotel, distributed with
lavishness the handsome State badge of blue, entertained their
visitors with a great orchestra, paraded in light silk hats, and swung
across the street an immense banner predicting that &quot;Roscoe Conkling's
nomination assures the thirty-five electoral votes of New York.&quot; These
headquarters were in marked contrast to the modest rooms of other
States having favourite sons. No Blaine flag appeared, and only an oil
portrait of Hayes adorned the Ohio parlours. A Philadelphia delegate,
after surveying the Grand Hotel and the marchers, ironically remarked
that &quot;it was a mystery to him where the Custom-house got bail for all
those fellows.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>The appearance of Edwin D. Morgan, who called the convention to order,
evoked long-continued applause. It re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.334" id="Page_iii.334">iii. 334</a></span>called two decades of stirring
national life since he had performed a like duty in 1856. Theodore M.
Pomeroy's selection as temporary chairman likewise honoured New York,
and his address, although read from manuscript, added to his fame as
an orator. In seconding the nomination of Bristow, George William
Curtis, speaking &quot;for that vast body of Republicans in New York who
have seen that reform is possible within the Republican party,&quot; won
his way to the convention's heart as quickly as he did in 1860,
although each person present avowed, after Robert G. Ingersoll had
spoken, that for the first time he understood the possible compass of
human eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>Until the deciding ballot New York's part in the convention proved
perfunctory. Beyond the sound of its music and the tread of its
marchers neither applause nor good will encouraged its candidate.
Reformers regarded Conkling as the antithesis of Bristow, supporters
of Morton jealously scowled at his rivalry, and the friends of Blaine
resented his attitude toward their favourite. Only Hayes's little band
of expectant backers, hoping eventually to capture the New York
delegation, gracefully accorded him generous recognition.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
Conkling's support, beginning with ninety-nine votes, gradually fell
off to eighty-one, when the delegation, without formally withdrawing
his name, dropped him with not a word and divided between Blaine and
Hayes, giving the former nine votes and the latter sixty-one.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.335" id="Page_iii.335">iii. 335</a></span>
fact, Morton and Conkling, the two political legatees of Grant, fared
about alike, their strength in the North outside their respective
States aggregating only six votes. The President, believing a &quot;dark
horse&quot; inevitable, wrote a letter favouring Hamilton Fish.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>For Vice-President the convention turned to New York. Stewart L.
Woodford was the choice of the delegation. In presenting Conkling's
name his oratorical power had won admiration, while delegates from
Ohio, Indiana, and other Western States, where his voice had been
heard in opposition to Greenbackism, did not forget his unselfish
devotion, nor the brilliant rhetoric that clothed his unanswerable
arguments. But the Blaine States manifested genuine enthusiasm for
William A. Wheeler, a man of pure life, simple habits, ripe culture,
and sincere and practical principles, who had won the esteem of all
his associates in Congress. To add to his charm he had a good presence
and warm family affections. He possessed, too, a well-earned
reputation for ability, having served with credit in the Legislature,
in Congress, and as president of the constitutional convention of
1866-7. Conkling thought him &quot;not very well known.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> Nevertheless,
he had been mentioned for President, and throughout the long and
exciting contest two delegates from Massachusetts kept his name before
the convention. George F. Hoar, afterward the distinguished
Massachusetts senator, became especially active in his behalf, and
James Russell Lowell called him &quot;a very sensible man.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.336" id="Page_iii.336">iii. 336</a></span> Outside
delegations, therefore, without waiting for New York to act, quickly
exhibited their partiality by putting him in nomination.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Later,
when the Empire State named Stewart L. Woodford, the situation became
embarrassing. Finally, as the Wheeler vote rapidly approached a
majority, the Empire delegation, to escape being run over again,
reluctantly withdrew its candidate.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The roll call, thus abruptly
discontinued, showed Wheeler far ahead of the aggregate vote of all
competitors, and on motion his nomination was made unanimous.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>The rank and file of the party, exhibiting no discouragement because
of the outcome at Cincinnati, sought a strong candidate to head their
State ticket.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> To those possessing the reform spirit William M.
Evarts appealed as a representative leader. He had indicated no desire
to hold public office. Indeed, it may be said that he always seemed
disinterested in political conditions so far as they affected him
personally. Although his friends thought the old supporters of Seward,
if not Seward himself, had failed to sustain him for the United States
Senate in 1861 as faithfully as he would have supported the Secretary
of State under like conditions, there is no evidence that he ever
found fault. When in Hayes' Cabinet and afterwards in the Senate
(1885-91),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.337" id="Page_iii.337">iii. 337</a></span> he did not take or attempt to take, either in the counsels
of his party or of his colleagues, the leadership for which he was
admirably fitted. It is doubtful, in fact, if he ever realised the
strong hold he had upon the respect and admiration of the country. But
the people knew that his high personal character, his delightful
oratory, his unfailing wit and good-nature, and his great prestige as
a famous lawyer of almost unexampled success commended him as an ideal
candidate. Conspicuously among those urging his candidacy for governor
in 1876 appeared a body of influential leaders from the Union League
and Reform clubs of the metropolis, calling themselves Independents.
The Liberals, too, added voice to this sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>If the candidate could not be Evarts, the same elements evidenced a
disposition to support Edwin D. Morgan, who had shown of late a
disturbing independence of the machine. Of the other aspirants William
H. Robertson presented his usual strength in the Hudson River
counties.</p>

<p>Alonzo B. Cornell was the candidate of the organisation. Evarts had
illustrated his independence in accepting office under President
Johnson, in criticising the Grant administration, and in protesting
against the Louisiana incident. Robertson, in voting for Blaine, had
likewise gone to the outer edge of disloyalty. Nor did Morgan's
attitude at Cincinnati commend him. His ambition, which centred in the
vice-presidency, left the impression that he had cared more for
himself than for Conkling. Under these circumstances the Senator
naturally turned to Cornell, an efficient lieutenant, who, having
encountered heavy seas and a head wind, hoisted the signal of distress
and waited for Conk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.338" id="Page_iii.338">iii. 338</a></span>ling's coming. The Senator, however, did not
appear. His rooms were engaged, his name was added to the hotel
register, and Cornell's expectant friends declared that he would again
capture the convention with his oratory; but Conkling, knowing that in
political conventions the power of oratory depended largely upon
pledged delegations, prudently stayed away. Besides, he was not a
delegate, his partisans in Oneida having been put to rout. This forced
the withdrawal of Cornell, whose delegates, drifting to Morgan as the
lesser of two evils, nominated him on the first ballot.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> Evarts
was too great a man to be lifted into national prominence.</p>

<p>For lieutenant-governor, Sherman S. Rogers of Erie and Theodore M.
Pomeroy of Cayuga entered the lists. Encouraged by the folly of a few
rash friends, Cornell also allowed his name to be presented, &quot;since he
had been grievously wronged,&quot; said his eulogist, &quot;in the dishonest
count of 1868.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Cornell had adroitly extricated himself from
humiliating defeat in the morning by a timely withdrawal, but not
until George William Curtis declared his nomination &quot;the most
dangerous that could be made,&quot; and William B. Woodin of Cayuga had
stigmatised him, did he fully appreciate his unpopularity as the
representative of machine methods. Woodin's attack upon Cornell
undoubtedly weakened Pomeroy. It possessed the delectable acidity, so
reckless in spirit, but so delightful in form, that always made the
distinguished State senator's remarks attractive and diverting.
Although whatever weakened Pomeroy naturally strengthened Rogers, it
added greatly to the latter's influence that he represented the home
of William Dorsheimer, whom the Democrats would renominate, and in the
end the Buffalonian won by a handsome majority.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.339" id="Page_iii.339">iii. 339</a></span></p><p>The day's work, however, left bitter thoughts. Conkling's absence
exaggerated Arthur's poor generalship and George H. Sharpe's failure
to support Cornell. Sharpe was one of the organisation's cleverest
leaders, and his indifference to Cornell's interests left a jagged
wound that was not soon to heal. Moreover, it could not be concealed
that Morgan's nomination was a Pyrrhic victory. In fact, the
conventions at Cincinnati and Saratoga had thrown the Conkling machine
out of gear, and while the repair shop kept it running several years
longer, it was destined never again to make the speed it had formerly
attained.</p>

<h2>TILDEN ONE VOTE SHORT</h2>

<h2>1876</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">After</span> the election in 1875 the eyes of the national Democracy turned
toward Tilden as its inevitable candidate for President. He had not
only beaten a Canal ring, strengthened by remnants of the old Tweed
ring, but he had carried the State against the energies of a fairly
united Republican party. Moreover, he had become, in the opinion of
his friends, the embodiment of administrative reform, although he
suffered the embarrassment of a statesman who is suspected, rightly or
wrongly, of a willingness to purchase reform at any price.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> To
prove his right to be transferred from Albany to Washington he now
made his message to the Legislature a treatise upon national affairs.</p>

<p>Dwelling at length upon the financiering of the Federal Government,
Tilden sought to account for the financial depression, and in pointing
to a remedy he advocated the prompt resumption of specie payment,
criticised the dread of imaginary evils, encouraged economy in
legislation, and analysed the federal system of taxation and
expenditure. Furthermore, he sought to cut loose from the discredited
past of his party, and in paying high tribute to the patriotism of the
South, he expressed the hope that its acceptance of the results of the
war might end forever the retribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.341" id="Page_iii.341">iii. 341</a></span> visited upon it by the standing
menace of military force.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>The result at Cincinnati increased the necessity for nominating Tilden
at St. Louis, since Wheeler's popularity would materially assist in
replacing New York among reliable Republican States. Nevertheless, the
predatory class who had felt the weight of Tilden's heavy hand
fomented a most formidable opposition at the State convention.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
John Kelly deeply sympathised with the movement. He resented the
rivalry and independence of the Sage of Gramercy Park, and he did not
disguise his hostility. But Kelly's immediate need centred in the
exclusion of the Morrissey delegation, and when the Tilden lieutenants
proscribed it, the way was smoothed for the Governor's unanimous
endorsement with the gag of unit rule.</p>

<p>The admission of Kelly's delegates, however, did not close the mouths
of Tilden's opponents.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>. Organs of the Canal ring continued to
urge Seymour or Church for President, maintaining that the
convention's action did not bind the delegation. Church supported this
interpretation of the declaration.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> But it remained for the
<i>Express</i>, the authorised organ of Tammany, to stigmatise Tilden. With
cruel particularity it referred to his many-sided conduct as counsel
and director in connection with the foreclosure and reorganisation of
certain railroads in Illinois, reciting de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.342" id="Page_iii.342">iii. 342</a></span>tails of the affair in a
manner highly prejudicial to his integrity as a lawyer and his
reputation as a man of wealth. &quot;Of the weak points in Mr. Tilden's
railroad record,&quot; the editor suggestively added, &quot;we know more than we
care to publish.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> It doubled the severity of the blow because
suit had been instituted to compel Tilden to account for the proceeds
of large amounts of bonds and stock, and instead of meeting the
allegations promptly he had sought and obtained delay. This seemed to
give colour to the indictment.</p>

<p>At St. Louis Tilden's opponents, headed by John Kelly, Augustus
Schell, and Erastus Corning, soon wore these insinuations
threadbare.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> To their further declaration that in order to succeed
in November the Democracy must have one October State and that Tilden
could not carry Indiana, Dorsheimer and Bigelow, the Governor's
spokesmen, replied that New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut could
elect Tilden without Indiana. The colossal assurance of this answer
characterised the convention's confidence in Tilden's strength. It
possessed the South, the East, and the West. Hancock might be the
favourite in Pennsylvania, Parker in New Jersey, Bayard in Delaware,
Allen in Ohio, and Hendricks in Indiana, but as delegates entered the
convention city the dense Tilden sentiment smothered them. Even
scandal did not appreciably weaken it.</p>

<p>There was nothing mysterious about this strength. Tilden represented
success. Without him disaster threatened&#8212;with him victory seemed
certain. His achievement in administrative reform exaggerated
Republican failure; his grasp upon New York, the most vital State of
the North, magnified Democratic strength; his leadership, based upon
ideas and organisation, dwarfed political rivals; his acute legal
mind, leading to the largest rewards in the realm of law, captivated
business men; and his wealth, amassed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.343" id="Page_iii.343">iii. 343</a></span> the field of railroad
organisation and litigation, could fill Democracy's exchequer. Thus
Tilden, standing less on the Democratic platform than on his own
record, held the commanding position in his party, and the talk of his
unpopularity or how he obtained wealth seemed to make as little
impression as his professed devotion to the Wilmot Proviso in 1847, or
his departure for a season from a lifelong pro-slavery record to bear
a prominent part in the Barnburners' revolt of 1848. Indeed, so
certain was Tilden of success that he did not ask for advices until
after the nomination. James C. Carter of the New York bar, who
happened at the time to be with him respecting legal matters, wondered
at his unconcern. On their return from an evening drive Carter
ventured to suggest that he would find telegrams announcing his
nomination. &quot;Not until half-past nine,&quot; Tilden replied.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the first call of States made the Tilden managers
shiver.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Alabama divided its vote, Colorado caused a murmur of
disappointment, and the slump of Georgia and Illinois, with Missouri's
division, threatened them with heart-failure. The South wabbled, and
promised votes in the North found their way elsewhere. At the close of
the first roll-call Missouri asked if its vote could be changed, and
on receiving an affirmative answer, the Tilden men, pale with worried
excitement, awaited the result. A change to Hancock at that moment
would have been a serious calamity, for nearly one hundred votes
separated Tilden from the necessary two-thirds. When Missouri declared
for the New Yorker, however, the opportunity to turn the tide against
him was lost forever. The second ballot undoubtedly represented his
real strength.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> For second place Thomas A. Hendricks had no
opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.344" id="Page_iii.344">iii. 344</a></span></p><p>The platform, prepared under the eye of Tilden by Manton Marble, the
accomplished editor of the <i>World</i>, advocated reform as its key-note
and made historic its vituperative arraignment of the party in power.
On the vital question of the currency it demanded the repeal of the
resumption clause of the Act of 1875, denouncing it as an hindrance to
the resumption of specie payment. The Republicans, wishing to avoid
too sharp a conflict with the soft money sentiment of the West, had
pledged the fulfilment of the Public Credit Act,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> approved March
18, 1869, &quot;by a continuous and steady progress to specie payments.&quot;
Both declarations savoured of indefiniteness, but Hayes, in his letter
of acceptance (July 8), added greatly to his reputation for firmness
and decision of character in supplying the needed directness by
demanding the resumption of specie payment. On the other hand,
Tilden's letter (July 31) weakened the country's respect for him.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
He had no sympathy for soft money, but in supporting the demand for a
repeal of the resumption clause he urged, in a long, indefinite
communication, the importance of preparation for resumption, ignoring
the fact that the Act of 1875 anticipated such precaution. Although
less prolix in his treatment of civil service reform, he was no less
indefinite. After describing recognised evils he failed to indicate
any practical remedy beyond the &quot;conviction that no reform will be
complete and permanent until the Chief Executive is constitutionally
disqualified for re-election.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Speaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.345" id="Page_iii.345">iii. 345</a></span> character of the
men holding office his use of the word &quot;usufruct&quot; led to the derisive
appellation of &quot;Old Usufruct Tilden.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> On civil service reform
Hayes was more specific. He declared against the use of official
patronage in elections and pledged himself not to be a candidate for a
second term.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p>If Conkling had been balked in his desire to nominate Cornell, Tilden
was not less baffled a week later in his effort to promote William
Dorsheimer, his special friend. His genius for organisation had
smoothed the way for harmony at Saratoga.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Kelly and Morrissey
settled their differences in advance, the platform created no
discussion, and the appointment of electors-at-large provoked little
criticism; but when Tilden's lieutenants proposed Dorsheimer for
governor the convention revolted. It noisily demanded a Democrat, and
in the stampede that followed Clarkson N. Potter, backed by Tammany
and the Canal ring, rapidly accumulated strength despite Tilden's
personal opposition. To all of Tilden's friends vital objections
seemed to be raised. Dorsheimer could not command a solid Democratic
vote; Robinson favoured high canal tolls and cultivated Republican
affiliations; Manton Marble remained unpopular because the <i>World</i>
changed front in 1868; and Starbuck of Jefferson did not attract
Independents. For once Tilden had plainly been deceived as to his
strength. Furthermore, the convention, divided in its attention
between speeches for Potter and demands for Seymour, was beyond his
control. Nevertheless, as the delegates in their stentorian insistence
upon a &quot;Democrat&quot; became more and more furious for Seymour, the Tilden
managers, to head off the alarming sentiment for Potter, adroitly
increased the volume of the demand for the Oneidan. It was known that
Seymour had refused the use of his name. Telegrams to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.346" id="Page_iii.346">iii. 346</a></span> Kernan and
letters to the president of the convention alleged indisposition and
&quot;obstacles which I cannot overcome.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> But the convention,
conscious that the former governor had before changed his mind under
similar circumstances, closed its ears to his entreaties, and amidst
the most vociferous cheering nominated him by acclamation. The next
morning, with equal unanimity, it renominated Dorsheimer for
lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>A few days later Seymour, pleading mental inability to perform the
duties of the office, put himself out of the race.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> This gave
Tilden opportunity to re-form his lines, and upon the convention's
reassembling (September 13) Robinson easily won.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>Democratic factions likewise buried their differences in New York
City, Kelly and Morrissey uniting upon Smith Ely for mayor. The
Republicans nominated John A. Dix. Thus was the municipal struggle in
the metropolis, for the first time in many years, confined within
strict party lines.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>The campaign, although a prolonged and intensely exciting one,
developed no striking incidents. Democratic orators repeated Marble's
rhetorical arraignment of the Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.347" id="Page_iii.347">iii. 347</a></span>publican party, and the Democratic
press iterated and reiterated its symmetrical, burning sentences.
Marble's platform, besides being the most vitriolic, had the
distinction of being the longest in the history of national
conventions. Copies of it printed in half a dozen languages seemed to
spring up as plentifully as weeds in a wheatfield. Every cross-roads
in the State became a centre for its distribution. It pilloried
Grant's administration, giving in chronological order a list of his
unwise acts, the names and sins of his unfaithful appointees, and a
series of reasons why Tilden, the Reformer, could alone restore the
Republic to its pristine purity. It was a dangerous document because
history substantially affirmed its statement of facts, while the
rhythm of its periods and the attractiveness of its typography invited
the reader.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>Conkling, because of ill-health, limited his activity in the canvass
to one address.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> It was calmer than usual, but it shone with
sparkles of sarcasm and bristled with covert allusions readily
understood. It was noticeable, too, that he made no reference to Hayes
or to Wheeler. Nevertheless, party associates from whom he had
radically differed pronounced it a model of partisan oratory and the
most conclusive review of the political situation. He admitted the
corruption indicated by Marble, attributing it chiefly to the war
which incited speculative passion in all the activities of life, its
ill consequences not being confined exclusively to public affairs. In
contrasting the management of the two parties, he disclosed under
Buchanan a loss on each thousand dollars collected and disbursed of
six dollars and ninety-eight cents against forty cents during Grant's
first term and twenty-six cents during the three years of his second,
while current expenses under Buchanan amounted to one dollar and
ninety cents per capita to one dollar and seventy cents under Grant.
In ten years, he added, $800,000,000 of the debt had been paid,
nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.348" id="Page_iii.348">iii. 348</a></span> $50,000,000 of interest saved yearly, and the taxes reduced
$262,000,000 per annum.</p>

<p>Of civil service reform Conkling said nothing. He made a clear, sharp
issue on the resumption of specie payment, however, showing that the
demand for a repeal of the Act's most important feature was a bid for
the votes of soft-money advocates. The Southern question assumed even
greater importance. Tilden depended for success upon the Southern
States plus New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. This was
Dorsheimer's argument, put with characteristic grace and force at St.
Louis. The North had cause to fear, it was argued, if a solid South,
strengthened by States controlled by the great majorities in and about
New York City, could elect a President. The charge that Tilden
intended indemnifying the South and assuming the Confederate debt
increased the anxiety. Conkling's reference to the repayment of direct
taxes, the refund of the cotton tax, and the liquidation of Southern
claims mounted so high into the hundreds of millions that Tilden
deemed it prudent to issue a letter pledging an enforcement of the
Constitutional Amendments and resistance to such monetary demands.</p>

<p>Personal criticism of Tilden exploited his war record, his reputation
as a railroad wrecker, and his evasion of the income tax.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> The
accusation of &quot;railroad wrecking&quot; was scarcely sustained, but his
income tax was destined to bring him trouble. Nast kept his pencil
busy. One cartoon, displaying Tilden emptying a large barrel of
greenbacks into the ballot box, summed up the issues as follows: &quot;The
shot-gun policy South, the barrel policy North;&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.349" id="Page_iii.349">iii. 349</a></span> &quot;The solid South and
the solid Tammany;&quot; &quot;Tilden's war record&#8212;defeating the tax
collector.&quot; George William Curtis asserted that the Democrats of South
Carolina meant to carry the State for Tilden by means of &quot;the shot
gun,&quot; declaring that &quot;Jefferson Davis and the secessionists merely
endeavoured to enforce with bayonets the doctrines of Mr.
Tilden.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>Tilden displayed a stoical indifference to these personal attacks. He
made no speeches, he rarely exhibited himself to the public, and he
kept his own counsels. His adroit, mysterious movements recalled the
methods but not the conceit of Aaron Burr. Although Abram S. Hewitt,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, managed the campaign
with skill, Tilden relied largely upon his own shrewdness, displacing
old leaders for new ones, and making it clear to the country that he
ranked with Martin Van Buren as a great political manager. As he swept
onward like a conquering Marlborough, inspiring his party with
confidence and his opponents with fear, events favoured his designs.
The Belknap exposures, the Whiskey ring suits, the Babcock trial,
alarming and disgusting the country, inclined public opinion toward a
change which was expressed in the word &quot;reform.&quot; A combination of
propitious circumstances within the State, in nowise indebted to his
sagacity or assistance, also increased his strength. The collapse of
the Tweed and Canal rings justly gave him great prestige, but no
reason existed why the extinguishment of the State war debt and the
limitations of canal expenditures to canal revenues should add to his
laurels, for the canal amendment to the Constitution was passed and
the payment of the war debt practically accomplished before he took
office. Nevertheless, the resulting decrease of the State budget by
nearly one-half, being coincident with his term of office, added
prodigiously to his fame.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.350" id="Page_iii.350">iii. 350</a></span> Indeed, he seemed to be the darling of
Fortune, and on November 7, exactly according to his calculation, he
carried New York,<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But
Republicans claimed South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.</p>

<p>In the historic dispute which led to a division of the solid South,
partisan papers revelled in threats, and rumours indicated danger of
mob violence. To prevent fraud prominent citizens in the North,
appointed to represent each political party, watched the canvassing
boards in the three disputed States, and although it subsequently
developed that distinguished New Yorkers resorted to bribery,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> the
legal canvassing boards finally certified the electoral votes to Hayes
and Wheeler. On December 6 the official count in all the States gave
Hayes 185 votes and Tilden 184. The Democrats, deeply disturbed by the
action of the Returning Boards, now displayed a temper that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.351" id="Page_iii.351">iii. 351</a></span> resembled
the spirit preceding the civil war. Threats were openly made that
Hayes should never be inaugurated. The Louisville <i>Courier Journal</i>
announced that &quot;if they (our people) will rise in their might, and
will send 100,000 petitioners to Washington to present their memorial
in person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.352" id="Page_iii.352">iii. 352</a></span> there will be no usurpation and no civil war.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> A
prominent ex-Confederate in Congress talked of 145,000 well
disciplined Southern troops who were ready to fight.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Because the
President prudently strengthened the military forces about Washington
he was charged with the design of installing Hayes with the aid of the
army.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Republicans believed Tilden endeavoured to buy the
presidency. Although nothing was then known of Marble's and Weed's
efforts to tamper with the canvassing boards of South Carolina and
Florida, the disposition to &quot;steal&quot; a vote in Oregon, which clearly
belonged to Hayes, deprived Tilden's cause of its moral weight.
Indeed, so strongly did sentiment run against him that the <i>Nation</i>
&quot;lost nearly three thousand subscribers for refusing to believe that
Mr. Hayes could honourably accept the presidency.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>When Congress opened the Democrats, being in control of the House,
desired to continue the joint rule of February, 1865, directing that
&quot;no electoral vote objected to shall be counted except by the
concurrent votes of the two Houses.&quot; This would elect Tilden. On the
other hand, the Republicans, holding that the joint rule expired with
the Congress adopting it, insisted that, inasmuch as the canvass by
Congress at all previous elections had been confined exclusively to
opening the certificates of each State, sent to Washington under the
official seal of the respective governors, the Vice-President should
open and count the electoral votes and declare the result, the members
of the two Houses acting simply as witnesses. This would elect Hayes.
To many and especially to President Grant this controversy seemed full
of danger, to avert which if possible Congress adopted a resolution
providing for a committee of fourteen, equally divided between the
Senate and House, &quot;to report without delay such a measure as may in
their judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.353" id="Page_iii.353">iii. 353</a></span> be best calculated to accomplish the desired
end.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> On January 18 (1877) this committee reported a bill
providing that where two or more returns had been received from a
State such returns should be referred to an Electoral Commission
composed of five senators, five members of the House, and five
justices of the Supreme Court, who should decide any question
submitted to it touching the return from any State, and that such
decision should stand unless rejected by the concurrent votes of the
two Houses. By tacit agreement the Senate was to name three
Republicans and two Democrats, and the House three Democrats and two
Republicans, while the Bill itself appointed Justices Clifford,
Miller, Field, and Strong, a majority of whom were authorised to
select a fifth justice.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>When doubt as to the three Southern States precipitated itself into
the result of the election, Tilden exhibited characteristic diligence
and secrecy. He avoided public statements, but he scrutinised the
returns with the acumen exhibited in securing the Tweed evidence, and
left no flaw unchallenged in the title of his opponent. After the
action of the canvassing boards he contended that the joint rule of
1865 must govern, and in the study of the subject he devoted more than
a month to the preparation of a complete history of electoral counts,
showing it to have been the unbroken usage for Congress and not the
President of the Senate to count the vote.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Moreover, early in the
session of Congress he prepared two resolutions which raised the
issue, and urged his friends in the leadership of the House to take no
further step until the great constitutional battle had been fought
along that line, assuring them of his readiness to accept all the
responsibility of the out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.354" id="Page_iii.354">iii. 354</a></span>come. To appraise the country of the
strength of this position he also prepared an extended brief which
Governor Robinson incorporated as a part of his inaugural message on
January 1, 1877.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>Tilden first learned of the proposed Electoral Commission Bill on
January 14. Abram S. Hewitt brought the information, saying that
Bayard and Thurman of the Senate, being absolutely committed to it,
would concur in reporting it whatever Tilden's action.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> Tilden,
resenting the secrecy of its preparation as unwise and essentially
undemocratic, declined to give it his approval.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> In his later
telegrams to Hewitt he expressed the belief that &quot;We should stand on
the Constitution and the settled practice;&quot; that &quot;the other side,
having no way but by usurpation, will have greater troubles than we,
unless relieved by some agreement;&quot; that &quot;the only way of getting
accessions in the Senate is by the House standing firm;&quot; that &quot;we are
over-pressed by exaggerated fears;&quot; and that &quot;no information is here
which could justify an abandonment of the Constitution and practice of
the government, and of the rights of the two Houses and of the
people.&quot; To his friends who urged that time pressed, he exclaimed:
&quot;There is time enough. It is a month before the count.&quot;
Representations of the danger of a collision with the Executive met
his scorn. &quot;It is a panic of pacificators,&quot; he said. &quot;Why surrender
before the battle for fear of having to surrender after the
battle?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>In view of his resentment of the secrecy which characterised the
preparation of the Electoral Commission Bill, one wonders that Tilden
made no appeal directly to the people, demanding that his party stand
firm to &quot;the settled practice&quot; and allow Republicans peaceably to
inaugurate Hayes &quot;by usurpation&quot; rather than &quot;relieve them by some
agreement.&quot; His telegrams to congressmen could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.355" id="Page_iii.355">iii. 355</a></span> published, and
few if any one knew him as the author of the discussion in Robinson's
inaugural. The <i>Times</i> thought &quot;the old Governor's hand is to be seen
in the new Governor's message,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> but the <i>Nation</i> expressed doubt
about it.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> A ringing proclamation over his own signature, however,
would have been known before sunset to every Democratic voter in the
land. Blaine told Bigelow a year or two later that if the Democrats
had been firm, the Republicans would have backed down.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Tilden's
silence certainly dampened his party's enthusiasm. It recalled, too,
his failure to assail the Tweed ring until the <i>Times'</i> disclosure
made its destruction inevitable.</p>

<p>Bigelow, reflecting Tilden's thought, charged that in accepting the
plan of an Electoral Commission Thurman and Bayard were influenced by
presidential ambition, and that prominent congressmen could not regard
with satisfaction the triumph of a candidate who had been in nowise
indebted to them for his nomination or success at the polls.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> On
the other hand, Blaine says the Democrats favoured the Commission
because Davis, who affiliated with the Democratic party and had
preferred Tilden to Hayes, was to be chosen for the fifth justice. The
Maine statesman adds, without giving his authority, that Hewitt
advanced this as one of the arguments to induce Tilden to approve the
bill.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> In his history of the Hewitt-Tilden interview Marble makes
no mention of Davis' selection, nor does Bigelow refer to Tilden's
knowledge of it. Nevertheless, the strength disclosed for the bill
sustains Blaine's suggestion, since every Democrat of national
reputation in both Houses supported it. The measure passed the Senate
on January 24 and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.356" id="Page_iii.356">iii. 356</a></span> House on the 26th,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> but an unlooked-for
event quickly destroyed Democratic calculations and expectations, for
on January 25, too late for the party to recede with dignity or with
honour, the Democrats of the Illinois Legislature elected Davis by two
majority to the United States Senate in place of John A. Logan.
Probably a greater surprise never occurred in American political
history. It gave Davis an opportunity, on the ground of obvious
impropriety, to avoid what he neither sought nor desired, and narrowed
the choice of a fifth justice to out-and-out Republicans, thus
settling the election of Hayes. &quot;The drop in the countenance of Abram
S. Hewitt,&quot; said a writer who informed Tilden's representative of
Davis' transfer from the Supreme Court to the Senate, &quot;made it plain
that he appreciated its full significance.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Bigelow could not
understand why Davis did not serve on the Commission unless his
&quot;declination was one of the conditions of his election,&quot; adding that
&quot;it was supposed by many that Morton and others engineered the
agreement of Davis' appointment with full knowledge that he would not
serve.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> This cynical comment betrayed Tilden's knowledge of
&quot;things hoped for,&quot; and accounts for his final acquiescence in the
Commission, since Davis and a certainty were far better than a fight
and possible failure.</p>

<p>Another dagger-thrust that penetrated the home in Gramercy Park was
Conkling's exclusion from the Electoral Commission. Of all the members
of the famous committee the Senator had borne the most useful part in
framing the measure, and his appointment to the Commission was
naturally expected to follow.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> His biographer states that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.357" id="Page_iii.357">iii. 357</a></span>
declined to serve.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> &quot;If this be correct,&quot; says Rhodes, &quot;he shirked
a grave duty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> Bigelow charges the omission to the Senator's
belief &quot;that the vote of Louisiana rightfully belonged to Mr. Tilden,&quot;
and volunteers the information &quot;that Conkling had agreed to address
the Commission in opposition to its counting Louisiana for
Hayes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Conkling's absence from the Senate when the Louisiana
vote was taken corroborates Bigelow,<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> and supports the general
opinion which obtained at the time, that the Republicans, suspecting
Conkling of believing Tilden entitled to the presidency, intentionally
ignored him in the make-up of the Commission.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> The reason for
Conkling's failure subsequently to address the Commission in
opposition to counting Louisiana for Hayes nowhere explicitly appears.
&quot;Various explanations are in circulation,&quot; writes Bigelow, &quot;but I have
not been able to determine which of them all had the demerit of
securing his silence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<h2>CONKLING AND CURTIS AT ROCHESTER</h2>

<h2>1877</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">Two</span> State governments in Louisiana, one under Packard, a Republican,
the other under Nicholls, a Democrat, confronted Hayes upon the day of
his inauguration. The canvassing boards which returned the Hayes
electors also declared the election of Packard as governor, and it
would impeach his own title, it was said, if the President refused
recognition to Packard, who had received the larger popular majority.</p>

<p>It was not unknown that the President contemplated adopting a new
Southern policy. His letter of acceptance presupposed it, and before
the completion of the Electoral Commission's work political and
personal friends had given assurance in a published letter that Hayes
would not continue military intervention in the South.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Moreover,
the President's inaugural address plainly indicated such a purpose. To
inform himself of the extent to which the troops intervened,
therefore, and to harmonise if possible the opposing governments, he
sent a commission to New Orleans,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> who reported (April 21) a
returning board quorum in both branches of the Nicholls Legislature
and recommended the withdrawal of the army from the immediate vicinity
of the State House. This was done on April 24 and thenceforward the
Nicholls government controlled in State affairs.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.359" id="Page_iii.359">iii. 359</a></span></p><p>The President's policy quickly created discontent within the ranks of
the Republican party. Many violently resented his action, declaring
his refusal to sustain a governor whose election rested substantially
upon the same foundation as his own as a cowardly surrender to the
South in fulfillment of a bargain between his friends and some
Southern leaders.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Others disclaimed the President's obligation to
continue the military, declaring that it fostered hate, drew the
colour line more deeply, promoted monstrous local misgovernment, and
protected venal adventurers whose system practically amounted to
highway robbery. Furthermore, it did not keep the States under
Republican control, while it identified the Republican name with
vindictive as well as venal power, as illustrated by the Louisiana
Durrell affair in 1872,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> in the elections of 1874, and at the
organisation of the Louisiana Legislature early in 1875.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
Notwithstanding these potent reasons for the President's action the
judgment of a majority of his party deemed it an unwise and
unwarranted act, although Grant spoke approvingly of it.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>Similar judgment was pronounced upon the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.360" id="Page_iii.360">iii. 360</a></span> attempt to
reform the civil service by directing competitive examinations for
certain positions and by forbidding office-holders actively to
participate in political campaigns.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> &quot;No officer should be
required or permitted to take part in the management of political
organisations, caucuses, conventions, or election campaigns,&quot; he wrote
to the Secretary of the Treasury. &quot;Their right to vote and to express
their views on public questions, either orally or through the press,
is not denied, provided it does not interfere with the discharge of
their official duties. No assessments for political purposes should be
allowed.&quot; In a public order dated June 22 he made this rule applicable
to all departments of the civil service. &quot;It should be understood by
every officer of the government that he is expected to conform his
conduct to its requirements.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> To show his sincerity the
Presi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.361" id="Page_iii.361">iii. 361</a></span>dent also appointed a new Civil Service Commission, with Dorman
B. Eaton at its head, who adopted the rules formulated under Curtis
during the Grant administration, and which were applied with a measure
of thoroughness, especially in the Interior Department under Carl
Schurz, and in the New York post-office, then in charge of Thomas L.
James.</p>

<p>This firm and aggressive stand against the so-called spoils system
very naturally aroused the fears of many veteran Republicans of
sincere and unselfish motives, who had used offices to build up and
maintain party organisation, while the order restricting freedom of
political action provoked bitter antagonism, especially among members
of the New York Republican State Committee, several of whom held
important Federal positions. To add to the resentment an official
investigation of the New York custom-house was ordered, which
disclosed &quot;irregularities,&quot; said the report, &quot;that indicate the peril
to which government and merchants are exposed by a system of
appointments in which political influence dispenses with fitness for
the work.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> The President concurred. &quot;Party leaders should have no
more influence in appointments than other equally respectable
citizens,&quot; he said. &quot;It is my wish that the collection of the revenue
should be organised on a strictly business basis, with the same
guarantees for efficiency and fidelity in the selection of the chief
and subordinate officers that would be required by a prudent
merchant.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>The Republican press, in large part, deplored the President's action,
and while managing politicians smothered their real grievance under
attacks upon the Southern policy, they generally assumed an attitude
of armed neutrality and observation.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> No doubt the President was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.362" id="Page_iii.362">iii. 362</a></span>
much to blame for this discontent. He tolerated the abuses disclosed
by the investigation in New York, continued a disreputable r&#233;gime in
Boston, and installed a faction in Baltimore no better than the one
turned out. Besides, the appointment to lucrative offices of the
Republican politicians who took active part in the Louisiana Returning
Board had closely associated him with the spoils system.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
Moreover, his failure to remove offending officials discredited his
own rule and created an unfavourable sentiment, because after
provoking the animosity of office-holders and arousing the public he
left the order to execute itself. Yet the people plainly believed in
the President's policy of conciliation, sympathised with his desire to
reform abuses in the civil service, and honoured him for his
frankness, his patriotism, and his integrity. During the months of
August and September several Republican State conventions, notably
those in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Jersey
commended him, while Maine, under the leadership of Blaine, although
refusing to indorse unqualifiedly the policy and acts of the
Administration, refrained from giving any expression of
disapproval.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>New York's Republican convention assembled at Rochester on September
26. The notable absence of Federal office-holders who had resigned
committeeships and declined political preferment attracted attention,
otherwise the membership of the assembly, composed largely of the
usual array of politicians, provoked no comment. Conkling and Cornell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.363" id="Page_iii.363">iii. 363</a></span>
arrived early and took possession. In 1874 and in 1875 the Senator's
friends fought vigorously for control, but in 1877 the divided
sentiment as to the President's policies and the usual indifference
that follows a Presidential struggle inured to their benefit, giving
them a sufficient majority to do as they pleased.</p>

<p>Thus far Conkling had not betrayed his attitude toward the
Administration. At the time of his departure for Europe in search of
health, when surrounded by the chief Federal officials of the city, he
significantly omitted words of approbation or criticism, and with
equal dexterity avoided the expression of an opinion in the many
welcoming and serenade speeches amidst which his vacation ended in
August. No doubt existed, however, as to his personal feeling. The
selection of Evarts for secretary of state in place of Thomas C. Platt
for postmaster general did not make him happy.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> George William
Curtis's ardent support of the President likewise aided in separating
him from the White House. Nevertheless, Conkling's attitude remained a
profound secret until Thomas C. Platt, as temporary chairman, began
the delivery of a carefully prepared speech.</p>

<p>Platt was then forty-four years old. He was born in Owego, educated at
Yale, and as a man of affairs had already laid the foundation for the
success and deserved prominence that crowned his subsequent business
career. Ambition also took him early into the activities of public
political life, his party having elected him county clerk at the age
of twenty-six and a member of Congress while yet in his thirties. His
friends, attracted by his promise-keeping and truth-telling, included
most of the people of the vicinage. He was not an orator, but he
possessed the resources of tact, simplicity, and bonhomie, which are
serviceable in the management of men.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Moreover, as an or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.364" id="Page_iii.364">iii. 364</a></span>ganiser
he developed in politics the same capacity for control that he
exhibited in business. He had quickness of decision and flexibility of
mind. There was no vacillation of will, no suspension of judgment, no
procrastination that led to harassing controversy over minor details.
He seemed also as systematic in his political purposes as he was
orderly in his business methods. These characteristic traits, well
marked in 1877, were destined to be magnified in the next two decades
when local leaders recognised that his judgment, his capacity, and his
skill largely contributed to extricate the party from the chaotic
conditions into which continued defeat had plunged it.</p>

<p>Conkling early recognised Platt's executive ability, and their
friendship, cemented by likeness of views and an absence of rivalry,
kept them sympathetically together in clearly defined fields of
activity. In a way each supplemented the other. Platt was neither
self-opinionated nor overbearing. He dealt with matters political with
the light touch of a man of affairs, and although without sentiment or
ideals, he worked incessantly, listened attentively, and was anxious
to be useful, without taking the centre of the stage, or repelling
support by affectations of manner. But like Conkling he relied upon
the use of patronage and the iron rule of organisation, and too little
upon the betterment of existing political conditions.</p>

<p>This became apparent when, as temporary chairman, he began to address
the convention. He startled the delegates by calling the distinguished
Secretary of State a &quot;demagogue,&quot; and other Republicans who differed
with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.365" id="Page_iii.365">iii. 365</a></span> &quot;Pecksniffs and tricksters.&quot; As he proceeded dissent blended
with applause, and at the conclusion of his speech prudent friends
regretted its questionable taste. In declining to become permanent
president Conkling moved that &quot;the gentleman who has occupied the
chair thus far with the acceptance of us all&quot; be continued. This
aroused the Administration's backers, of whom a roll-call disclosed
110 present.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>The platform neither approved nor criticised the President's Southern
policy, but expressed the hope that the exercise of his constitutional
discretion to protect a State government against domestic violence
would result in peace, tranquillity, and justice. Civil service reform
was more artfully presented. It favoured fit men, fixed tenure, fair
compensation, faithful performance of duty, frugality in the number of
employ&#233;s, freedom of political action, and no political assessments.
Moreover, it commended Hayes's declaration in his letter of acceptance
that &quot;the officer should be secure in his tenure so long as his
personal character remained untarnished and the performance of his
duty satisfactory,&quot; and recommended &quot;as worthy of consideration,
legislation making officers secure in a limited fixed tenure and
subject to removal only as officers under State laws are removed in
this State on charges to be openly preferred and adjudged.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> This
paralleled the President's reform except as to freedom of political
action, and in support of that provision it arrayed a profoundly
impressive statement, showing by statistics that Hayes's order, if
applied to all State, county, and town officials in New York, would
exclude from political action one voter out of every eight and
one-half. If this practical illustration exhibited the weakness of the
President's order it also anticipated what the country afterwards
recognised, that true reform must rest upon competitive examination
for which the Act of March 3, 1871 opened the way, and which President
Hayes had directed for certain positions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.366" id="Page_iii.366">iii. 366</a></span></p>
<p>But despite the platform's good points, George William Curtis,
construing its failure to endorse the Administration into censure of
the President, quickly offered a resolution declaring Hayes's title to
the presidency as clear and perfect as that of George Washington, and
commending his efforts in the permanent pacification of the South and
for the correction of abuses in the civil service.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Curtis had
never sought political advantage for personal purposes. The day he
drifted away from a clerkship in a business firm and landed among the
philosophers of Brook Farm he became an idealist, whom a German
university and years of leisure travel easily strengthened. So fixed
was his belief of moral responsibility that he preferred, after his
unfortunate connection with <i>Putnam's Magazine</i>, to lose his whole
fortune and drudge patiently for sixteen years to pay a debt of
$60,000 rather than invoke the law and escape legal liability. He was
an Abolitionist when abolitionism meant martyrdom; he became a
Republican when others continued Whigs; and he stood for Lincoln and
emancipation in the months of dreadful discouragement preceding
Sheridan's victories in the Shenandoah. He was likewise a civil
service reformer long in advance of a public belief, or any belief at
all, that the custom of changing non-political officers on merely
political grounds impaired the efficiency of the public service,
lowered the standard of political contests, and brought reproach upon
the government and the people. It is not surprising, therefore, that
he stood for a President who sought to re-establish a reform that had
broken down under Grant, and although the effort rested upon an
Executive order, without the permanency of law, he believed that any
attempt to inaugurate a new system should have the undivided support
of the party which had demanded it in convention and had elected a
President pledged to establish it. Moreover, the President had offered
Curtis his choice of the chief missions, expecting him to choose the
English. Remembering Irving in Spain, Bancroft in Germany, Mot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.367" id="Page_iii.367">iii. 367</a></span>ley in
England, and Marsh in Italy, it was a great temptation. But Curtis,
appreciating his &quot;civic duty,&quot; remained at home, and now took this
occasion to voice his support of the Executive who had honoured
him.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>His speech, pitched in an exalted key, sparkled with patriotic
utterances and eloquent periods, with an occasional keen allusion to
Conkling. He skilfully contrasted the majority's demand for harmony
with Platt's reference to Evarts as a &quot;demagogue&quot; and to civil service
reform as a &quot;nauseating shibboleth.&quot; He declared it would shake the
confidence of the country in the party if, after announcing its
principles, it failed to commend the agent who was carrying them out.
Approval of details was unnecessary. Republicans did not endorse
Lincoln's methods, but they upheld him until the great work of the
martyr was done. In the same spirit they ought to support President
Hayes, who, in obedience to many State and two or three National
conventions, had taken up the war against abuses of the civil service.
If the convention did not concur in all his acts, it should show the
Democratic party that Republicans know what they want and the man by
whom to secure such results.</p>

<p>In speaking of abuses in the civil service he told the story of
Lincoln looking under the bed before retiring to see if a
distinguished senator was waiting to get an office,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> referred to
the efforts of Federal officials to defeat his own election to the
convention, and declared that the President, by his order, intended
that a delegate like himself, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.368" id="Page_iii.368">iii. 368</a></span> only one vote, should not meet
another with one hundred votes in his pocket obtained by means of
political patronage. Instead of the order invading one's rights it was
intended to restore them to the great body of the Republicans of New
York, who now &quot;refuse to enter a convention to be met&#8212;not by brains,
not always by mere intelligence, not always by convictions, or by
representative men, but by the forms of power which federal patriots
assume.&quot; He did &quot;not believe any eminent Republican, however high his
ambition, however sore his discontent, hoped to carry the Republican
party of the United States against Rutherford B. Hayes. Aye, sir, no
such Republican, unless intoxicated with the flattery of parasites, or
blinded by his own ambition.&quot; He spoke of Conkling's interest in
public affairs as beginning contemporaneously with his own, of their
work side by side in 1867, and of their sustaining a Republican
President without agreement in the details of his policy, and he
closed with the prayer that they might yet see the Republican party
fulfilling the hope of true men everywhere, who look to it for
honesty, for reform, and for pacification.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Conkling had been waiting for Curtis as the American fleet waited for
the Spanish at Santiago. Curtis had adorned the centre of opposition
until he seemed most to desire what would most disappoint Conkling.
For months prior to the Cincinnati convention <i>Harper's Weekly</i>
bristled with reasons that in its opinion unfitted the Senator for
President, and advertised to the country the desire at least of a
large minority of the party in New York to be rid of him. With
consummate skill he unfolded Conkling's record, and emphasised his
defence of the questionable acts that led to a deep distrust of
Republican tendencies. To him the question was not whether a National
convention could be persuaded to adopt the Senator as its candidate,
but whether, &quot;being one of the leaders that had imperilled the party,
it was the true policy for those who patriotically de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.369" id="Page_iii.369">iii. 369</a></span>sired Republican
success.&quot; Furthermore, Curtis had a habit of asking questions. &quot;With
what great measure of statesmanship is his name conspicuously
identified?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> and, as if this admitted of no reply, he followed it
with more specific inquiries demanding to know &quot;why the Senator had
led a successful opposition to Judge Hoar for the Supreme Bench,&quot; and
become &quot;the ardent supporter of Caleb Cushing for chief justice, and
of Alexander Shepherd for commissioner of the District of Columbia?&quot;
These interrogatories seemed to separate him from statesmen of high
degree and to place him among associates for whom upright citizens
should have little respect.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. The part Greeley took at Chicago to defeat Seward,
Curtis played at Cincinnati to defeat Conkling. He declared him the
especial representative of methods which the best sentiment of the
party repudiated, and asserted that his nomination would chill
enthusiasm, convince men of the hopelessness of reform within the
party, and lose the vote indispensable for the election of the
Republican candidate. If his words were parliamentary, they were not
less offensive. Once only did he strike below the belt. In the event
of the Senator's nomination he said &quot;a searching light would be turned
upon Mr. Conkling's professional relations to causes in which he was
opposed to attorneys virtually named by himself, before judges whose
selection was due to his favour.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.370" id="Page_iii.370">iii. 370</a></span></p>
<p>This thrust penetrated the realm of personal integrity, a
characteristic in which Conkling took great pride. Perhaps the hostile
insinuation attracted more attention because it prompted the public,
already familiar with the occult influences that persuaded Tweed's
judges, to ask why men who become United States judges upon the
request of a political boss should not be tempted into favourable
decisions for the benefactor who practises in their courts? Curtis
implied that something of the kind had happened in Conkling's
professional career. Disappointment at Cincinnati may have made the
presidential candidate sore, but this innuendo rankled, and when he
rose to oppose Curtis's resolution his powerful frame seemed in a
thrill of delight as he began the speech which had been laboriously
wrought out in the stillness of his study.</p>

<p>The contrast in the appearance of the two speakers was most striking.
Curtis, short, compact, punctilious in attire, and exquisitely
cultured, with a soft, musical voice, was capable of the noblest
tenderness. Conkling, tall, erect, muscular, was the very embodiment
of physical vigour, while his large, well-poised head, his strong
nose, handsome eyes, well-cut mouth, and prominent chin, were
expressive of the utmost resolution. The two men also differed as much
in mind as in appearance. Curtis stood for all the force and feeling
that make for liberal progressive principles; Conkling, the product of
a war age, of masterly audacity and inflexible determination,
represented the conservative impulse, with a cynical indifference to
criticism and opposition.</p>

<p>The preface to his attack was brief. This was a State convention to
nominate candidates, he said in substance, and the National
Administration was not a candidate or in question. He repelled the
idea that it suggested or sanctioned such a proceeding, and although
broad hints had been heard that retribution would follow silence, any
one volunteering for such a purpose lacked discretion if not
sincerity. &quot;Who are these men who, in newspapers or elsewhere, are
cracking their whips over me and playing school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.371" id="Page_iii.371">iii. 371</a></span>master to the party?
They are of various sorts and conditions. Some of them are the
man-milliners, the dilettante and carpet knights of politics, whose
efforts have been expended in denouncing and ridiculing and accusing
honest men.... Some of them are men who, when they could work
themselves into conventions, have attempted to belittle and befoul
Republican administrations and to parade their own thin veneering of
superior purity. Some of them are men who, by insisting that it is
corrupt and bad for men in office to take part in politics, are
striving now to prove that the Republican party has been unclean and
vicious all its life.... Some of these worthies masquerade as
reformers. Their vocation and ministry is to lament the sins of other
people. Their stock in trade is rancid, canting self-righteousness.
They are wolves in sheep's clothing. Their real object is office and
plunder. When Dr. Johnson defined patriotism as the last refuge of a
scoundrel, he was unconscious of the then undeveloped capabilities and
uses of the word reform.... Some of these new-found party overseers
who are at this moment laying down new and strange tenets for
Republicans, have deemed it their duty heretofore, upon no
provocation, to make conventions and all else the vehicle of
disparaging Republican administrations. Some of them sat but yesterday
in Democratic conventions, some have sought nominations at the hands
of Democrats in recent years, and some, with the zeal of neophytes and
bitterness of apostates, have done more than self-respecting Democrats
would do to vilify and slander their government and their
countrymen.... They forget that parties are not built up by
deportment, or by ladies' magazines, or gush.... The grasshoppers in
the corner of a fence, even without a newspaper to be heard in,
sometimes make more noise than the flocks and herds that graze upon a
thousand hills.... For extreme license in criticism of administrations
and of everybody connected with them, broad arguments can no doubt be
found in the files of the journal made famous by the pencil of Nast.
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.372" id="Page_iii.372">iii. 372</a></span> a convention may not deem itself a chartered libertine of
oracular and pedantic conceits.&quot;</p>

<p>Conkling could not comprehend why Republicans of New York should be
thought predisposed to find fault with Hayes. Without their votes he
could not have become the candidate. &quot;Even the member from Richmond
was, I believe, in the end prevailed upon, after much difficulty, to
confer his unique and delicate vote also.&quot; New York congressmen, with
few exceptions, heartily supported the measure without which Hayes
would never have been effectually inaugurated. No opposition had come
from New York. What, then, is the meaning and purpose of constantly
accusing Republicans of this State of unfriendly bias? Wanton assaults
had been made upon Republicans, supposed to be inspired by the
champions and advisers of the President. For not doing more in the
campaign of 1876, he, an office-holder, had been denounced by the same
men who now insist that an office-holder may not sign even a notice
for a convention. No utterance hostile to men or measures had
proceeded from him. Not a straw had been laid in the way of any man.
Still he had been persistently assaulted and misrepresented by those
claiming to speak specially for the Administration. A word of greeting
to his neighbours had drawn down bitter and scornful denunciations
because it did not endorse the Administration.</p>

<p>&quot;These anxious and super-serviceable charioteers seem determined to
know nothing but the President and his policy and them crucified....
The meaning of all this is not obscured by the fact that the new
President has been surrounded and courted by men who have long purred
about every new Administration.... Some of these disinterested
patriots and reformers have been since the days of Pierce the friends
and suitors of all Administrations and betrayers of all. The assaults
they incite are somewhat annoying. It would have been a luxury to
unfrock some of them, but it has seemed to me the duty of every
sincere Republican to endure a great deal rather than say any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.373" id="Page_iii.373">iii. 373</a></span>thing to
introduce division or controversy into party ranks.... I am for
peace.... I am for everything tending to that end.... I am for one
thing more&#8212;the success of the Administration in everything that is
just and wise and real.&quot;</p>

<p>The Senator thought Hayes deserved the same support other Republican
administrations had received. Whenever he is right he should be
sustained; whenever misled by unwise or sinister advice, dissent
should be expressed. This right of judgment is the right of every
citizen. He exercised it in Congress under Lincoln and Grant, who
never deemed an honest difference of opinion cause for war or quarrel,
&quot;nor were they afflicted by having men long around them engaged in
setting on newspapers to hound every man who was not officious or
abject in fulsomely bepraising them. The matters suggested by the
pending amendment,&quot; he continued, &quot;are not pertinent to this day's
duties, and obviously they are matters of difference. They may promote
personal and selfish aims, but they are hostile to concord and good
understanding between Republicans at a time when they should all be
united everywhere, in purpose and action. Let us agree to put
contentions aside and complete our task. Let us declare the purposes
and methods which should guide the government of our great State.&quot;</p>

<p>After this plea for harmony, the Senator commented briefly upon the
remarks of other delegates, complimented Platt, and then turned again
upon Curtis. Being assured that the latter did not refer to him as the
Senator for whom Lincoln looked under the bed, he concluded: &quot;Then I
withhold a statement I intended to make, and I substitute for it a
remark which I hope will not transgress the proprieties or liberties
of this occasion. It is this: If a doubt arose in my mind whether the
member from Richmond intended a covert shot at me, that doubt sprang
from the fact that that member has published, in a newspaper, touching
me, not matters political&#8212;political assaults fairly conducted no man
ever heard me complain of&#8212;but imputations upon my personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.374" id="Page_iii.374">iii. 374</a></span> integrity
so injurious and groundless, that as I think of them now, nothing but
the proprieties of the occasion restrain me from denouncing them and
their author as I feel at liberty to do in the walks of private life.
Mr. President, according to that Christian code which I have been
taught, there is no atonement in the thin lacquer of public courtesy,
or of private ceremonial observance, for the offence one man does
another when he violates that provision of the Decalogue, which,
speaking to him, says, 'Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour,' and which means thou shalt not do it, whatever thy
personal or political pique or animosity may be. The member from
Richmond did me honour overmuch in an individual if not personal
exhortation wherein he was pleased to run some parallel between
himself and me.... Let me supplement the parallel by recalling a
remark of a great Crusader when Richard of England and Leopold of
Austria had held dispute over the preliminaries of battle: 'Let the
future decide between you, and let it declare for him who carries
furthest into the ranks of the enemy the sword of the cross.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>From a mere reading of this speech it is difficult, if not impossible,
to realise its effect upon those who heard it.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> As an oratorical
exhibition the testimony of friends and of foes is alike offered in
its unqualified praise. He spoke distinctly and with characteristic
deliberation, his stateliness of manner and captivating audacity
investing each sentence with an importance that only attaches to the
utterances of a great orator. The withering sneer and the look of
contempt gave character to the sarcasms and bitter invectives which he
scattered with the prodigality of a seed-sower. When he declared
Curtis a &quot;man-milliner,&quot; his long, flexible index finger and eyes
ablaze with resentment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.375" id="Page_iii.375">iii. 375</a></span> pointed out the editor as distinctly as if he
had transfixed him with an arrow, while the slowly pronounced
syllables, voiced in a sliding, descending key, gave the title a
cartoon effect. Referring to the parallel in Curtis's peroration, he
laid his hand on his heart, bowed toward his antagonist with mock
reverence, and distorted his face with an expression of ludicrous
scorn. In repelling the innuendo as to his &quot;personal integrity,&quot; the
suppressed anger and slowly spoken words seemed to preface a challenge
to mortal combat, and men held their breath until his purpose cleared.
The striking delivery of several keen thrusts fixed them in the
memory. Given in his deep, sonorous tones, one of these ran much as
follows: &quot;When Doc-tor-r-r Ja-a-awnson said that patr-r-riotism-m was
the l-a-w-s-t r-r-refuge of a scoundr-r-rel he ignor-r-red the
enor-r-rmous possibilities of the word r-refa-awr-rm.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Other
sentences, now historic, pleased opponents not less than friends. That
parties are not upheld by &quot;deportment, ladies' magazines, or gush&quot;
instantly caught the audience, as did &quot;the journal made famous by the
pencil of Nast,&quot; and the comparison suggested by Edmund Burke of the
noise of &quot;grasshoppers in the corner of a fence even without a
newspaper to be heard in.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, these moments of accord between speaker and hearers
deepened by contrast the depth of bitterness existing between him and
the friends of the President. His denunciation of Curtis had included
Evarts if not other members of the Administration, and during the
recital of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.376" id="Page_iii.376">iii. 376</a></span> the rhythmical sentences of arraignment dissent mingled
with applause. &quot;He was hissed,&quot; said a reporter of long experience,
&quot;as I have never heard any speaker hissed at a convention
before.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> A friend to whom Conkling read the speech on the
preceding Sunday pronounced it &quot;too severe,&quot; and the nephew excluded
the epithet &quot;man-milliner&quot; from the address as published in his
uncle's biography.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> The contemporary press, reflecting the injury
which Conkling's exuberance of denunciation did his cause, told how
its effect withered as soon as oratory and acting had ceased. Within
an hour after its delivery Charles E. Fitch of the Rochester
<i>Democrat-Chronicle</i>, voicing the sentiment of the Senator's best
friends, deprecated the attack. Reading the article at the breakfast
table on the following morning, Conkling exclaimed, &quot;the man who wrote
it is a traitor!&quot; It was &quot;the man&quot; not less than the criticism that
staggered him. Fitch was a sincere friend and a writer with a purpose.
His clear, incisive English, often forcible and at times eloquent, had
won him a distinct place in New York journalism, not more by his
editorials than by his work in various fields of literature, and his
thought usually reflected the opinion of the better element of the
party. To Conkling it conveyed the first intimation that many
Republican papers were to pronounce his address unfortunate, since it
exhorted to peace and fomented bitter strife.</p>

<p>Curtis refused to make public comment, but to Charles Eliot Norton,
his intimate friend, he wrote: &quot;It was the saddest sight I ever knew,
that man glaring at me in a fury of hate, and storming out his foolish
blackguardism. I was all pity. I had not thought him great, but I had
not suspected how small he was. His friends, the best, were
confounded. One of them said to me the next day, 'It was not amazement
that I felt, but consternation.' I spoke offhand and the report is
horrible. Conkling's speech was carefully written out, and therefore

<h2>THE TILDEN R&#201;GIME ROUTED</h2>

<h2>1877</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> result at Rochester, so unsatisfactory to a large body of
influential men to whom the President represented the most patriotic
Republicanism, was followed at Albany by a movement no less
disappointing to a large element of the Democratic party.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> In
their zeal to punish crime Secretary of State Bigelow and
Attorney-General Fairchild had made themselves excessively obnoxious
to the predatory statesmen of the canal ring, who now proposed to
destroy the Tilden r&#233;gime. Back of them stood John Kelly, eager to
become the master, and determined to accomplish what he had failed to
do at St. Louis.</p>

<p>As if indifferent to the contest Bigelow had remained in Europe with
Tilden, and Fairchild, weary of the nervous strain of office-holding,
refused to make an open canvass for the extension of his official
life. Nevertheless, the friends of reform understood the importance of
renominating the old ticket. It had stood for the interest of the
people. Whatever doubt might have clouded the public mind as to
Tilden's sincerity as an ardent, unselfish reformer, Republicans as
well as Democrats knew that Bigelow and Fairchild represented an
uncompromising hostility to public plunderers, and that their work, if
then discontinued, must be shorn of much of its utility. Their friends
understood, also, the importance of controlling the temporary
organisation of the convention, otherwise all would be lost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.379" id="Page_iii.379">iii. 379</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the Presidential struggle had seriously weakened Tilden.
In the larger field of action he had displayed a timid, vacillating
character, and the boldest leaders of his party felt that in the final
test as a candidate he lost because he hesitated. Besides, the
immediate prospect of power had disappeared. Although Democrats talked
of &quot;the great Presidential crime,&quot; and seemed to have their eyes and
minds fastened on offices and other evidences of victory, they
realised deep in their hearts that Hayes was President for four years,
and that new conditions and new men might be existent in 1880.
Moreover, many Democratic leaders who could not be classed as selfish,
felt that Tilden, in securing the advantageous position of a reformer,
had misrepresented the real Democratic spirit and purpose in the
State. They deeply resented his course in calling about him, to the
exclusion of recognised and experienced party advisers, men whom he
could influence, who owed their distinction to his favour, and who
were consequently devoted to his fortunes. Upon some of these he
relied to secure Republican sympathy, while he depended upon
Democratic discipline to gain the full support of his party. If events
favoured his designs and the exigencies of an exciting Presidential
election concealed hostility, these conditions did not placate his
opponents, who began plotting his downfall the moment the great
historic contest ended. This opposition could be approximately
measured by the fact that the entire party press of the State, with
three exceptions, disclosed a distinct dislike of his methods.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Tilden's friends held control. Governor Robinson, an
executive of remarkable force, sensitively obedient to principles of
honest government and bold in his utterances, remained at the head of
a devoted band which had hitherto found its career marked by triumph
after triumph, and whose influence was still powerful enough to rally
to its standard new men of strength as well as old leaders flushed
with recent victories. Robinson's courageous words espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.380" id="Page_iii.380">iii. 380</a></span>cially engaged
the attention of thoughtful Democrats. He did not need to give reasons
for the opposition to John Bigelow, or the grievance against Charles
S. Fairchild, whose court docket sufficiently exposed the antagonism
between canal contractors and the faithful prosecutor. But in his
fascinating manner he told the story of the Attorney-General's heroic
firmness in refusing to release Tweed.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> In Robinson's opinion the
vicious classes, whose purposes discovered themselves in the
depredations of rings and weakness for plunder, were arrayed against
the better element of the party which had temporarily deprived the
wrong-doers of power, and he appealed to his friends to rescue
administrative reform from threatened defeat.</p>

<p>The Governor was not unmindful of his weakness. Besides Tilden's loss
of prestige, the renomination of the old ticket encountered the
objection of a third term, aroused the personal antagonism of hundreds
of men who had suffered because of its zeal, and arrayed against it
all other influences that had become hostile to Tilden through envy or
otherwise during his active management of the party. Moreover, he
understood the cunning of John Kelly and the intrigue of his
lieutenants. Knowing that contesting delegations excluded precincts
from taking part in the temporary organisation, these men had sought
to weaken Tilden by creating fictitious contests in counties loyal to
him, thus offsetting John Morrissey's contest against Tammany. It was
a desperate struggle, and the only gleam of light that opened a way to
Tilden's continued success came from the action of the State
Committee, which gave David B. Hill of Chemung 19 votes for temporary
chairman to 14 for Clarkson N. Potter of New York. The victory,
ordinarily meaning the control of the Committee on Credentials,
restored hope if not confidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.381" id="Page_iii.381">iii. 381</a></span></p>

<p>Hill was the friend of Robinson. Although his name had not then become
a household word, he was by no means unknown throughout the State. He
had come into public life as city attorney in 1864 at the age of
twenty-one, and had shown political instincts for the most part
admirable. Of those to go to the Assembly in 1871 to aid in the work
of judicial purification, Hill was suggested by O'Conor and Tilden as
one of the trustworthy lawyers, and in February, 1872, when the
legislative committee began its investigation into the charges
presented by the Bar Association against Judges Barnard, Cardozo,
Ingraham, and McCunn with a view to their impeachment, Hill sat by the
side of Tilden. It was recognised that he belonged to the coterie of
able men who stood at the front of the reform movement.</p>

<p>His personal habits, too, commended him. He seems to have been
absolved from the love of wine, and if the love of a good woman did
not win him, he created a substantial home among his books, and worked
while others feasted. He talked easily, he learned readily, and with
the earnestness of one who inherited an ambition for public life he
carefully equipped himself for a political as well as a professional
career. He had a robust, straightforward nature. Men liked his
courage, his earnestness, his effectiveness as a debater, and his
declared purposes which were thoroughly in unison with the spirit of
his party. But it was his boldness, tempered with firmness, which
justified Robinson in singling him out for chairman. Still, the
courage exhibited as a presiding officer in one of the stormiest
conventions that ever assembled in the Empire State did not win him
distinction.</p>

<p>The Kelly opposition raised no question of principle. The platform
denounced the defeat of Tilden as due to fraud, applauded Hayes for
his Southern policy, declared for reapportionment of the State, and
bitterly assailed railroad subsidies. But it had no words of
unkindness for Tilden and Robinson. Indeed, with a most sublime
display of hypocrisy, Kelly pointed with pride to the fruits of their
admin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.382" id="Page_iii.382">iii. 382</a></span>istrations, made illustrious by canal reforms, economy, and the
relentless prosecution of profligate boards and swindling contractors,
and vied with the apostles of administrative reform in calling them
&quot;fearless&quot; and &quot;honest,&quot; and in repudiating the suggestion of desiring
other directing spirits. His only issue involved candidates. Should it
be the old ticket or a new one? Should it be Bigelow for a third term,
or Beach, the choice of the ring? In opposing the old ticket several
delegates extended their hostility only to Bigelow; others included
the attorney-general. Only a few demanded an entire change. But
Tammany and the Canal ring tactfully combined these various elements
with a skill never before excelled in a State convention. Their
programme, sugar-coated with an alleged affection for Tilden, was
arranged to satisfy the whim of each delegate, while Robinson's
policy, heavily freighted with well doing, encountered the odium of a
third-term ticket.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Governor's control of the chairmanship assured him
victory unless Hill yielded too much. But Kelly was cunning and quick.
After accepting Hill without dissent, he introduced a resolution
providing that the convention select the committee on contested seats.
To appoint this committee was the prerogative of the chairman, and
Hill, following Cornell's bold ruling in 1871, could have refused to
put the motion. When he hesitated delegates sprang to their feet and
enthroned pandemonium.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> During the cyclone of epithets and
invective John Morrissey for the last time opposed John Kelly in a
State convention. His shattered health, which had already changed
every lineament of a face that successfully resisted the blows of
Yankee Sullivan and John C. Heenan, poorly equipped him for the
prolonged strain of such an encounter, but he threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.383" id="Page_iii.383">iii. 383</a></span> his envenomed
adjectives with the skill of a quoit-pitcher.</p>

<p>Distributed about the hall were William Purcell, DeWitt C. West,
George M. Beebe, John D. Townsend, and other Tammany talkers, who had
a special aptitude for knockdown personalities which the metropolitan
side of a Democratic convention never failed to understand. Their loud
voices, elementary arguments, and simple quotations neither strained
the ears nor puzzled the heads of the audience, while their jibes and
jokes, unmistakable in meaning, sounded familiar and friendly.
Townsend, a lawyer of some prominence and counsel for Kelly, was an
effective and somewhat overbearing speaker, who had the advantage of
being sure of everything, and as he poured out his eloquence in
language of unmeasured condemnation of Morrissey, he held attention if
he did not enlighten with distracting novelty.</p>

<p>Morrissey admitted he was wild in his youth, adding in a tone of
sincere penitence that if he could live his life over he would change
many things for which he was very sorry. &quot;But no one, not even Tweed
who hates me,&quot; he exclaimed, pointing his finger across the aisle in
the direction of Kelly, &quot;ever accused me of being a thief.&quot;
Morrissey's grammar was a failure. He clipped his words, repeated his
phrases, and lacked the poise of a public speaker, but his opponents
did not fail to understand what he meant. His eloquence was like that
of an Indian, its power being in its sententiousness, which probably
came from a limited vocabulary.</p>

<p>At the opening of the convention Robinson's forces had a clear
majority,<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> but in the presence of superior generalship, which
forced a roll-call before the settlement of contests, Tammany and the
Canal ring, by a vote of 169 to 114, passed into control. To Tilden's
friends it came as the death knell of hope, while their opponents,
wild with delight, turned the convention into a jubilee. &quot;This is the
first Democratic triumph in the Democratic party since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.384" id="Page_iii.384">iii. 384</a></span> 1873,&quot; said
Jarvis Lord of Monroe. &quot;It lets in the old set.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>The adoption of the Credentials Committee's report seated Tammany,
made Clarkson N. Potter permanent chairman, and turned over the party
machine. Pursuing their victory the conquerors likewise nominated a
new ticket.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Quarter was neither asked nor offered. Robinson had
squarely raised the issue that refusal to continue the old officials
would be repudiation of reform, and his friends, as firmly united in
defeat as in victory, voted with a calm indifference to the threats of
the allied power of canal ring and municipal corruptionists. Indeed,
their boast of going down with colours flying supplemented the
vigorous remark of the Governor that there could be no compromise with
Tweed and canal thieves.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>This apparently disastrous result encouraged the hope that
Republicans, in spite of Conkling's indiscretion at Rochester, might
profit by it as they did in 1871. Upon the surface Republican
differences did not indicate bitterness. Except in the newspapers no
organised opposition to the Senator had appeared, and the only mass
meeting called to protest against the action of the Rochester
convention appealed for harmony and endorsed the Republican
candi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.385" id="Page_iii.385">iii. 385</a></span>dates.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> Even Curtis, the principal speaker, although
indulging in some trenchant criticism, limited his remarks to a
defence of the Administration. Nevertheless, the presence of William
J. Bacon, congressman from the Oneida district, who voiced an intense
admiration for the President and his policies, emphasised the fact
that the Senator's home people had elected a Hayes Republican. Indeed,
the Senator deemed it essential to establish an organ, and in October
(1877) the publication of the Utica <i>Republican</i> began under the
guidance of Lewis Lawrence, an intimate friend. It lived less than two
years, but while it survived it reflected the thoughts and feelings of
its sponsor.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>The campaign presented several confusing peculiarities. Governor
Robinson in his letter to a Tammany meeting refused to mention the
Democratic candidates, and Tilden, after returning from Europe,
expressed the belief in his serenade speech that &quot;any nominations that
did not promise co&#246;peration in the reform policy which I had the
honour to inaugurate and which Governor Robinson is consummating will
be disowned by the Democratic masses.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> This was a body-blow to
the Ring. Its well-directed aim also struck the ticket with telling
effect, for its election involved the discontinuance of Fairchild's
spirited canal prosecutions. On the other hand, the adoption of the
recent amendment, substituting for the canal commission a
superintendent of public works to be appointed by the Governor, made
the election of Olcott and Seymour especially desirable, since it
would give Robinson and his reforms stronger support than Tilden had
in the State board. Yet it could not be denied that the success of the
Albany ticket would be construed as a defeat of Tilden's ascendency.</p>

<p>Similar confusion possessed the Republican mind. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.386" id="Page_iii.386">iii. 386</a></span> large body of men,
resenting the Rochester convention's covert condemnation of the
President's policies, hesitated to vote for candidates whose victory
would be attributed to Republican opposition to the Administration.
This singular political situation made a very languid State campaign.
An extra session of Congress called Conkling to Washington, Tilden
retired to Gramercy Park, the German-Independent organisation limited
its canvass to the metropolis, and the candidates of neither ticket
got a patient hearing. Other causes contributed to the Republican
dulness. Old leaders became inactive and government officials refused
to give money because of their interpretation of the President's civil
service order, while rawness and indifference made newer leaders
inefficient. After the October collapse in Ohio conditions became
hopelessly discouraging.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> The tide set more heavily in favour of
the Democracy, and each discordant Republican element, increasing its
distrust, practically ceased work lest the other profit by it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the hunt for State senators, involving the election of a
United States Senator in 1879, provoked animated contests which
centred about the candidacy of John Morrissey, whom Republicans and
the combined anti-Tammany factions backed with spirit. Morrissey had
carried the Tweed district for senator in 1874, and the taunt that no
other neighbourhood would elect a notorious gambler and graduate of
the prize-ring goaded him into opposing Augustus Schell in one of the
fashionable districts of the metropolis. Schell had the advantage of
wealth, influence, long residence in the precinct, and the
enthusiastic support of Kelly, who turned the contest into a battle
for the prestige of victory. For the moment the fierceness of the
fight excited the hopes of Republicans that the State might be
carried, and to spread the influence of the warring Democratic
factions into all sections of the commonwealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.387" id="Page_iii.387">iii. 387</a></span> Republican journals
made a combined attack upon Allen C. Beach.</p>

<p>Like Sanford E. Church, Beach was a courteous, good-natured
politician, who tried to keep company with a canal ring and keep his
reputation above reproach. But his character did not refine under the
tests imposed upon it. His policy of seeming to know nothing had
resulted in doubling the cost of canal repairs during his four years
in office. A careful analysis of his record showed that only once did
he vote against the most extravagant demands of the predatory
contractors. This did not prove him guilty of corruption, &quot;but when as
the steady servant of the canal ring,&quot; it was asked, &quot;he voted
thousands and thousands of dollars, sometimes at the rate of a hundred
thousand a day, into the pockets of men whom he knew to be thieves,
and on claims which he must have known were full of fraud, was he not
lending himself to corruption?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> This charge his opponents
circulated through many daily and scores of weekly papers, making the
weakness of his character appear more objectionable.</p>

<p>To these attacks Beach affected an indifference which he did not
really feel, for the pride of a candidate who desires the respect of
his neighbours is not flattered by their distrust of his integrity.
Church had felt the iron enter his soul, and had Tilden and the
reformers rearoused the moral awakening that refused to tolerate the
Chief Justice in 1874, Beach must have fallen the victim of his
partiality to a coterie of political associates willing to benefit at
the expense of his ruin. As it was he received a plurality of 11,000,
while Seymour and Olcott, his associates upon the ticket, obtained
35,000 and 36,000 respectively.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>The election of State senators in which Conkling had so vital an
interest exhibited the work of influential Hayes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.388" id="Page_iii.388">iii. 388</a></span> Republicans, who,
openly desiring his destruction, defeated his candidates in Brooklyn,
Rochester, and Utica.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> Nevertheless, by carrying eighteen of the
thirty-two districts he saved fighting ground for himself in the
succeeding year.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Indeed, he was able to point to the popular vote
and declare that he was as strong in New York as the President was in
Ohio. It was known, too, that if Morrissey survived, the Senator would
profit by the prize-fighter's remarkable majority of nearly 4,000 over
Augustus Schell, a victory which ranked as the crowning achievement of
the senatorial campaign.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> But Morrissey, prostrated by his
exertions, did not live to reciprocate. He spent the winter in Florida
and the early spring in Saratoga. Finally, after the loss of speech,
his right arm, which had so severely punished Yankee Sullivan, became
paralysed, and on May 1 (1878) Lieutenant-governor Dorsheimer
announced his death to the Senate. &quot;It is doubtful,&quot; added a colleague
in eulogy, &quot;if such boldness and daring in political annals were ever
shown as he displayed in his last canvass.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<h2>GREENBACKERS SERVE REPUBLICANS</h2>

<h2>1878</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> Democrats rejoiced over their victory in 1877, a new
combination, the elements of which had attracted little or no
attention, was destined to cause serious disturbance. Greenbackism had
not invaded New York in 1874-5, when it flourished so luxuriantly in
Ohio, Indiana, and other Western States. Even after the party had
nominated Peter Cooper for President in 1876, it polled in the Empire
State less than 1,500 votes for its candidate for governor, and in
1877, having put Francis E. Spinner, the well-known treasurer of the
United States, at the head of its ticket, its vote fell off to less
than 1,000.</p>

<p>Meantime the labour organisations, discontented because of long
industrial inaction, had formed a Labour Reform party. This
organisation gradually increased its strength, until, in 1877, it
polled over 20,000 votes. Encouraged by success its leaders held a
convention at Toledo, Ohio, on February 22 (1878), and resolved to
continue the Cooper movement. It resented the resumption of specie
payment, favoured absolute paper money, and demanded payment of the
public debt in greenbacks. On May 10 the executive council, calling
themselves Nationalists, coalesced with the Greenbackers, and issued a
call for a National Greenback Labour Reform convention to assemble at
Syracuse on July 25. This sudden extension of the movement attracted
widespread attention, and although the convention was marked by great
turbulence and guided by inconspicuous leaders, it seemed as if by
magic to take possession of a popular issue which gathered about its
standard thousands of ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.390" id="Page_iii.390">iii. 390</a></span>nest men. Gideon J. Tucker, a former
Democratic secretary of state, who had led the Americans in 1859, was
nominated for judge of the Court of Appeals. To its platform it added
declarations favouring a protective tariff and excluding the Chinese.</p>

<p>The treatment of the Greenback question earlier in the year by the
older parties had materially strengthened the Nationalists. Democratic
conventions distinctly favoured their chief issue, and Republicans
employed loose and vague expressions. So accomplished and experienced
a politician as Thurlow Weed complimented the bold declarations of
Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, who had left the Republicans to
become the independent leader of a vast mass of voters that accepted
his Greenback theories and joined in his sneers at honest money.
Republican congressmen, returning from Washington, told how their
party held Greenback views and why Greenbackers ought to support it.
The Secretary of the Republican Congressional Committee practically
announced himself a Greenback Republican, and Blaine's position seemed
equivocal. During the entire financial debate in Congress, Conkling
said nothing to mould public opinion upon the question of sound money,
while the Utica <i>Republican</i>, his organ, thought it a &quot;mistake to
array the Republican party, which originated the Greenback, as an
exclusively hard-money party.... It is not safe or wise to make the
finances a party question.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> As late as July 30, the evening
preceding the Maine convention, Blaine objected to the phrase &quot;gold or
its equivalent,&quot; preferring the word &quot;coin,&quot; which subsequently
appeared in the platform.</p>

<p>The election in Maine, hailed with joy by every organ of the Greenback
movement, showed how profound was the political disturbance. The
result made it plain that the chief political issue was one of common
honesty, and that an alliance of Democratic and Greenback interests
threatened Republican ascendency. In the presence of such dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.391" id="Page_iii.391">iii. 391</a></span>ger
Republican leaders, recognising that harmony could alone secure
victory, called a State convention to meet at Saratoga on September
26. As the time for this important event approached the impression
deepened that real harmony must rest upon an acceptance of the
President's plea for honest money and the honest payment of the
nation's bonds. The word &quot;coin&quot; seemed insufficient, since both coin
and currency should be kept at par with gold, and although this would
make Republicans &quot;an exclusively hard-money party,&quot; which Conkling's
organ characterised as a &quot;mistake,&quot; the common danger proved a
sufficient magnet to unite the two factions on a platform declaring
that national pledges should be redeemed in letter and spirit, that
there should be no postponement of resumption, and that permanent
prosperity could rest alone on the fixed monetary standard of the
commercial world.</p>

<p>To further exclude just cause of offence Conkling, in accepting the
chairmanship of the convention, broke his long silence upon the
currency question, and without sarcasm or innuendo honoured the
President by closely following the latter's clear, compact, and
convincing speeches on hard money. George William Curtis led in the
frequent applause. Speaking of convention harmony the <i>Times</i> declared
that during the address &quot;there seemed to be something in the air which
made children of strong men. Many of the delegates were affected to
tears.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> Curtis also stirred genuine enthusiasm. He had not been
captious as to the form of the platform. To him it sufficed if the
convention keyed its resolutions to the President's note for sound
money, which had become the Administration's chief work, and although
the spectacle of Curtis applauding and supplementing Conkling's speech
seemed as marvellous as it was unexpected, it did not appear out of
place. Indeed, the environment at Saratoga differed so radically from
conditions at Rochester that it required a vivid fancy to picture
these men as the hot combatants of the year before. The bril<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.392" id="Page_iii.392">iii. 392</a></span>liant,
closely packed Rochester audience, the glare of a hundred gas jets,
and an atmosphere surcharged with intense hostility, had given place
to gray daylight, a sullen sky, and a morning assemblage tempered into
harmony by threatened danger. The absence of the picturesque greatly
disappointed the audience. The labour of reading a speech from printed
proofs marred Conkling's oratory, and Curtis' effort to compliment the
President without arousing resentment spoiled the rhetorical finish
that usually made his speeches enjoyable. But the prudence of the
speakers and the cordial reception of the platform proved thoroughly
acceptable to the delegates, who nominated George F. Danforth for the
Court of Appeals and then separated with the feeling that the State
might be redeemed.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Democratic State convention which assembled at Syracuse
on September 25 became more violent and boisterous than its
predecessor. Confident of defeat unless Tammany participated in the
preliminary organisation, John Kelly, through his control of the State
Committee, secured Albert P. Laning of Erie for temporary chairman.
Laning ruled that the roll of delegates as made up by the State
committee should be called except those from New York and Kings, and
as to these he reserved his decision. In obedience thereto the vote of
uncontested delegations stood 132 to 154 in favour of Tilden and
Robinson, whereas the admission of Tammany and Kings would make it 181
to 195 in favour of Kelly. Would the chair include these contested
delegations in the roll-call? To admit one side and exclude the other
before the settlement of a contest was a monstrous proposition. The
history of conventions did not furnish a supporting precedent.
Nevertheless, Laning, wishing to succeed Dorsheimer as
lieutenant-governor in 1879 and relying upon Tammany to nominate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.393" id="Page_iii.393">iii. 393</a></span> and
elect him, had evidenced a disposition to rule in the Boss's favour,
and when, at last, he did so, the angry convention sprang to its feet.
For three hours it acted like wild men.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> Under a demand for the
previous question Laning refused to recognise the Tilden delegates,
and the latter's tumult drowned the voice of the chair. Finally,
physical exhaustion having restored quiet, Kings County declined to
vote and Tammany was added without being called. This left the result
154 to 195 in favour of John Kelly. An hour later Laning, hissed and
lampooned, left the convention unthanked and unhonoured.</p>

<p>But having gotten into the convention Tammany found it had not gotten
into power. The Tilden forces endorsed Robinson's administration,
refused to dicker with Greenbackers, whom Kelly was suspected of
favouring, and assuaged their passion by nominating George B. Bradley
of Steuben for the Court of Appeals. While Tammany was looking for
votes to get in on, it bargained with St. Lawrence to support William
H. Sawyer, whose success seemed certain. On the second ballot,
however, Bradley's vote ran up to 194, while Sawyer's stopped at 183.
This left Kelly nothing but a majority of the State committee, which
was destined, in the hour of great need, to be of little service.</p>

<p>Throughout the State the several parties put local candidates in the
field. The Greenbackers, exhibiting the activity of a young and
confident organisation, uniformly made congressional and legislative
nominations. In one congressional district they openly combined with
the Democrats, and in several localities their candidates announced an
intention of co&#246;perating with the Democratic party. In the metropolis
the various anti-Tammany factions supported independent candidates for
Congress and combined with Republicans in nominating a city ticket
with Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.394" id="Page_iii.394">iii. 394</a></span> Cooper for mayor.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Kelly, acting for Tammany,
selected Augustus Schell. This alignment made the leaders of the
combined opposition sanguine of victory. It added also to the
confidence of Republicans that the Greenbackers were certain to draw
more largely from the ranks of the Democrats.</p>

<p>The difference between the Syracuse and Saratoga platforms was
significant. Democrats declared &quot;gold and silver, and paper
convertible into coin at the will of the holder, the only currency of
the country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> Convertible into what kind of coin? it was asked.
Coin of depreciated value, or the fixed monetary standard of the
commercial world? The <i>Nation</i> thought &quot;this platform not noticeable
for strength or directness of statement.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> The Republican plank
was clearer. &quot;We insist that the greenback shall be made as good as
honest coin ... that our currency shall be made the best currency, by
making all parts of it, whether paper or coin, equivalent,
convertible, secure, and steady.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> As the campaign advanced a
resistless tendency to force the older parties into the open made it
plain that if the Democrats did not say just what they meant, the
Republicans meant more than they said, for their speakers and the
press uniformly declared that the greenback, which had carried the
country triumphantly through the war, must be made as good as gold.
Meantime the Democratic leaders realised that &quot;fiat&quot; money had a
strange fascination for many of their party.</p>

<p>To add to Democratic embarrassment the <i>Tribune</i>, in the midst of the
canvass, began its publication of the cipher despatches which had
passed between Tilden's personal friends and trusted associates during
the closing and exciting months of 1876.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> The shameful story,
revealed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.395" id="Page_iii.395">iii. 395</a></span> the <i>Tribune's</i> discovered key to the cipher, made a
profound impression. As shown elsewhere the important telegrams passed
between Manton Marble and Smith M. Weed on one side, and Henry
Havermeyer and William T. Pelton, Tilden's nephew, on the other.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
Marble had called McLin of the Florida board an &quot;ague-smitten pariah&quot;
for having charged him with attempted bribery, but these translated
telegrams corroborated McLin. Moreover, notwithstanding Tilden's
comprehensive and explicit denial, it sorely taxed the people's faith
to believe him disconnected with the correspondence, since the corrupt
bargaining by which he was to profit was carried on in his own house
by a nephew, who, it was said, would scarcely have ventured on a
transaction so seriously affecting his uncle's reputation without the
latter's knowledge. &quot;Of their [telegrams] effect in ruining Mr.
Tilden's fortunes, or what was left of them,&quot; said the <i>Nation</i>,
&quot;there seems no doubt.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Whatever of truth this prophecy
contained, the revelation of the cipher despatches greatly
strengthened the Republican party and brought to a tragic end Clarkson
N. Potter's conspicuous failure to stain the President.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>The result of the October elections likewise encouraged Republicans.
It indicated that the Greenback movement, which threatened to sweep
the country as with a tornado, had been stayed if not finally
arrested, and thenceforth greater activity characterised the canvass.
Conkling spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.396" id="Page_iii.396">iii. 396</a></span> often; Woodford, who had done yeoman service in the
West, repeated his happily illustrated arguments; and Evarts crowded
Cooper Union. In the same hall Edwards Pierrepont, fresh from the
Court of St. James, made a strenuous though belated appeal. Speaking
for the Democrats, Kernan advocated the gold standard, declaring it
essential to commercial and the workingmen's prosperity. Erastus
Brooks shared the same view, and Dorsheimer, with his exquisite choice
of words, endeavoured to explain it to a Tammany mass meeting. John
Kelly, cold, unyielding, precise, likewise talked. There was little
elasticity about him. He dominated Tammany like a martinet, naming its
tickets, selecting its appointees, and outlining its policies. Indeed,
his rule had developed so distinctly into a one-man power that four
anti-Tammany organisations had at last combined with the Republicans
in one supreme effort to crush him, and with closed ranks and firm
purpose this coalition exhibited an unwavering earnestness seldom
presented in a local campaign.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> It was intimated that Kelly having
in mind his reappointment as city comptroller in 1880, sought
surreptitiously to aid Cooper.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> Kelly saw his danger. He
recognised the power of his opponents, the weakness of Schell whom he
had himself named for mayor, and the strength of Cooper, a son of the
distinguished philanthropist, whose independence of character had
brought an honourable career; but the assertion that the Boss, bowing
to the general public sentiment, gave Cooper support must be dismissed
with the apocryphal story that Conkling was in close alliance with
Tammany. Doubtless Kelly's disturbed mind saw clearly that he must
eventually divide his foes to recover lost prestige. Nevertheless, it
was after November 5, the day of Tammany's blighting overthrow, that
he shaped his next political move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.397" id="Page_iii.397">iii. 397</a></span></p><p>The election returns disclosed that the greatly increased
Greenback-Labour vote, aggregating 75,000, had correspondingly
weakened the Democratic party, especially in the metropolis, thus
electing Danforth to the Court of Appeals, Cooper as mayor, the entire
anti-Tammany-Republican ticket, a large majority of Republican
assemblymen, and twenty-six Republican congressmen, being a net gain
of eight.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> Indeed, the divisive Greenback vote had produced a
phenomenal crop of Republican assemblymen. After the crushing defeat
of the Liberal movement in 1872 the Republicans obtained the
unprecedented number of ninety-one. Now they had ninety-eight, with
nineteen hold-over senators, giving them a safe working majority in
each body and seventy-six on joint ballot. This insured the
re-election of Senator Conkling, which occurred without Republican
opposition on January 21, 1879. One month later the Utica <i>Republican</i>
closed its career. While its existence probably gratified the founder,
it had done little more than furnish opponents with material for
effective criticism.</p>

<p>The Democrats, who supported Lieutenant-governor Dorsheimer for United
States senator, protested against granting Conkling a certificate of
election because no alteration of senate or assembly districts had
occurred since the enumeration of 1875, as required by the
constitution, making the existing legislature, it was claimed, a
legislature <i>de facto</i> and not <i>de jure</i>. This was a new way of
presenting an old grievance. For years unjust inequality of
representation had fomented strife, but more recently the rapid growth
of New York and Brooklyn had made the disparity more conspicuous,
while continued Republican control of the Senate had created intense
bitterness. In fact, a tabulated statement of the inequality between
senatorial districts enraged a Democrat as quickly as a red flag
infuriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.398" id="Page_iii.398">iii. 398</a></span> the proverbial bull.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> Although the caucus refused to
adopt the protest, it issued an address showing that New York and
Kings were entitled to ten senators instead of seven and forty-one
assemblymen instead of thirty-one. These additional members, all
belonging to Democratic districts, said the address, are now awarded
to twelve counties represented by Republicans. The deep indignation
excited throughout the State by such manifest injustice resulted in a
new apportionment which transferred one assemblyman from each of six
Republican counties to New York and Kings. This did not correct the
greater injustice in the senatorial districts, however, and in
permitting the measure to become a law without his signature Governor
Robinson declared that the &quot;deprivation of 150,000 inhabitants in New
York and Kings of their proper representation admits of no apology or
excuse.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<h2>REMOVAL OF ARTHUR AND CORNELL</h2>

<h2>1878-9</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">One</span> week before the election of 1877 President Hayes nominated
Theodore Roosevelt for collector of customs, L. Bradford Prince for
naval officer, and Edwin A. Merritt for surveyor, in place of Chester
A. Arthur, Alonzo B. Cornell, and George H. Sharpe.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> The terms of
Arthur and Cornell had not expired, and although their removal had
been canvassed and expected for several months, its coming shocked the
party and increased the disgust of the organisation. George William
Curtis, with the approval of Evarts, urged the promotion of James L.
Benedict for collector, a suggestion which the Secretary of the
Treasury stoutly opposed. If Arthur, the latter argued, was to be
removed because of his identification with a system of administration
which the President desired to abolish, no reason existed for
promoting one who had made no effort to reform that system. No one
questioned Roosevelt's ability, high character, and fitness for the
place, but to those who resented the removal of Arthur his nomination
was an offence.</p>

<p>Chester A. Arthur had succeeded Thomas Murphy as collector of the port
in November, 1871. He was then forty-seven years old, a lawyer of fair
standing and a citizen of good repute. He had studied under the
tuition of his clergyman father, graduated at Union College, taught
school in his native Vermont, cast a first vote for Winfield Scott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.400" id="Page_iii.400">iii. 400</a></span>
and joined the Republican party at its organisation. At the outbreak
of the rebellion Governor Morgan appointed him quartermaster-general,
his important duties, limited to the preparation and forwarding of
troops to the seat of war, being performed with great credit. When
Seymour succeeded Morgan in 1863 Arthur resumed his law practice,
securing some years later profitable employment as counsel for the
department of city assessments and taxes.</p>

<p>From the first Arthur showed a liking for public life. He was the
gentleman in politics. The skill of an artist tailor exhibited his
tall, graceful figure at its best, and his shapely hands were
immaculately gloved. His hat advertised the latest fashion just as his
exquisite necktie indicated the proper colour.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> He was equally
particular about his conduct. Whatever his environment he observed the
details of court etiquette. His stately elegance of manner easily
unbent without loss of dignity, and although his volatile spirits and
manner of living gave him the appearance of a <i>bon vivant</i>, lively and
jocose, with less devotion to work than to society, it was noticeable
that he attracted men of severer mould as easily as those vivacious
and light-hearted associates who called him &quot;Chet.&quot; While Fenton,
after Greeley's failure as a leader, was gathering the broken threads
of party management into a compact and aggressive organisation, Arthur
enjoyed the respect and confidence of every local leader, who
appreciated his wise reticence and perennial courtesy, blended with an
ability to control restless and suspicious politicians by timely hints
and judicious suggestions. Indeed, people generally, irrespective of
party, esteemed him highly because of his kindness of heart, his
conciliatory disposition, his lively sense of humour, and his
sympathetic attention to the interests of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.401" id="Page_iii.401">iii. 401</a></span> about him. He was
neither self-opinionated, argumentative, nor domineering, but tactful,
considerate, and persuasive. There was also freedom from prejudice,
quickness of decision, a precise knowledge of details, and a
flexibility of mind that enabled him to adapt himself easily to
changing conditions.</p>

<p>When Conkling finally wrested the Federal patronage from Fenton and
secured to himself the favour and confidence of the Grant
administration, Arthur bivouacked with the senior Senator so quietly
and discreetly that Greeley accepted his appointment as collector
without criticism. &quot;He is a young man of fair abilities,&quot; said the
editor, &quot;and of unimpeached private character. He has filled no such
r&#244;le in public affairs as should entitle him to so important and
responsible a part, but as things go, his is an appointment of fully
average fitness and acceptability. With the man we have no difference;
with the system that made him collector we have a deadly quarrel. He
was Mr. Murphy's personal choice, and he was chosen because it is
believed he can run the machine of party politics better than any of
our great merchants.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>In party initiative Arthur's judgment and modesty aided him in
avoiding the repellent methods of Murphy. He did not wait for
emergencies to arise, but considering them in advance as possible
contingencies, he exercised an unobtrusive but masterful authority
when the necessity for action came. He played an honest game of
diplomacy. What others did with Machiavellian intrigue or a cynical
indifference to ways and means, he accomplished with the cards on the
table in plain view, and with motives and objects frankly disclosed.
No one ever thought his straightforward methods clumsy, or
unbusinesslike, or deficient in cleverness. In like manner he studied
the business needs of the customs service, indicating to the Secretary
of the Treasury the flagrant use of backstair wiles, and pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.402" id="Page_iii.402">iii. 402</a></span> out
to him ways of reform.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> He sought in good faith to secure
efficiency and honesty, and if he had not been pinioned as with ball
and chain to a system as old as the custom-house itself, and upon
which every political boss from DeWitt Clinton to Roscoe Conkling had
relied for advantage, he would doubtless have reformed existing
peculation and irregularities among inspectors, weighers, gaugers,
examiners, samplers, and appraisers.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Until this army of placemen
could be taken out of politics Secretary Sherman refused to believe it
possible to make the custom-house &quot;the best managed business agency of
the government,&quot; and as Arthur seemed an inherent part of the system
itself, the President wished to try Theodore Roosevelt.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> It is
safe to conclude, judging the father's work by the later achievements
of his illustrious son, that the Chief Executive's choice would have
accomplished the result had Conkling allowed him to undertake it.</p>

<p>When Conkling felt himself at ease, in congenial society, he displayed
his mastery of irony and banter, neither hesitating to air his opinion
of persons nor shrinking from admissions which were candid to the
verge of cynicism. At such times he had not veiled his intense dislike
of the Administration. After Hayes's election his conversation
discovered as aggressive a spirit as he had exhibited at Rochester,
speaking of the Secretary of State as &quot;little Evarts,&quot; and charging
the President with appointing &quot;a Democratic cabinet,&quot; whose principal
labour had been &quot;to withdraw Republican support from me.&quot; Apropos of
Schurz, he told a story of the man who disbelieved the Bible because
he didn't write it. He criticised the Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.403" id="Page_iii.403">iii. 403</a></span> press for praising
Tilden as governor and &quot;lampooning&quot; him as a candidate for the
presidency, pronounced Packard's title as good as Hayes's, and
declared the President's &quot;objectionable and dishonourable&quot; record
consisted not in the withdrawal of the troops but in bargaining with
Southerners. &quot;Every man knows,&quot; he said, &quot;that on the face of the
returns Packard was more elected than Hayes. You cannot present those
returns in any form that will not give more legality to Packard as
Governor than to Hayes as President. People say this man assumes all
the virtues of reform in an office which he has gained by the simple
repudiation of the ladder that lifted him. It is the general record of
usurpers that though sustained they do their favours to the other
side.... I have no faith in a President whose only distinct act is
ingratitude to the men who voted for him and to the party which gave
him its fealty. In the domain and forum of honour that sense of Mr.
Hayes's infidelity stands forward and challenges him. It is felt by
honest men all over the country. He smiles and showers on the
opposition the proofs of a disturbed mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of the civil service order the Senator was no less severe.
&quot;That celebrated reformatory order was factional in its intent, made
in the interests of envious and presuming little men. Sherman
(secretary of the treasury) goes out to Ohio and makes speeches in
defiance of it; McCrary (secretary of war) goes to Iowa and manages a
convention in spite of it; and Devens (attorney-general) says the
order meant itself to be disobeyed, and that the way to obey it was to
violate it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.404" id="Page_iii.404">iii. 404</a></span></p>
<p>Conkling's criticism of the fitful execution of the civil service
order was not too severe. Instead of justifying the expectations he
had aroused by vigorously enforcing the principles of his letter of
acceptance and inaugural address, the President, as if inthralled by
some mysterious spell, had discredited his professions by his
performances. The establishment of a real change in the system of
appointments and of office-holding control invited a severe contest,
and success depended upon the courage and conviction of the
Administration itself. For firmness, however, Hayes substituted
hesitation, compromise, and in some instances surrender. Numerous
cases were cited in proof of this criticism, notably the reappointment
of Chauncey I. Filley, postmaster at St. Louis, whom George William
Curtis pronounced the most conspicuous office-holder in the country
for his active manipulation of politics. &quot;He is a shining example of
'the thing to be reformed.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>The President's removal of Arthur and Cornell, it was argued, was no
less irrational. In failing to charge them with inefficiency he
subjected himself to the graver charge of inconsistency, since his
letter of acceptance and inaugural address declared in substance that
efficient officers would be retained. The President meant, his friends
assumed, that political activity nullified efficiency, to which
opponents replied that the President, after inviting Arthur to carry
out the recommendations of the Jay Commission, had condoned the
collector's wrong-doing if any existed, making him an agent for
reform, and that his subsequent removal was simply in the interest of
faction. Cornell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.405" id="Page_iii.405">iii. 405</a></span> case likewise presented a peg upon which to hang
severe criticism, since the Administration, when asked for the reason
of his removal, dodged the decisive one. Such inconsistency showed
timidity and confusion instead of courage and conviction,
disappointing to friends and ridiculous to opponents.</p>

<p>Conkling made use of these and other points. Indeed, for more than six
weeks after Congress convened he bent all his energies and diplomacy
to defeat the confirmation of Roosevelt and Prince. That a Republican
senator might be substituted for a Democrat on the commerce committee,
of which he was chairman and to which the nominations were referred,
he delayed action until a reorganisation of the Senate. Finally, in a
forceful and pathetic speech, regarded by colleagues as his most
impressive address,<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> he illuminated what he deemed an act of
injustice to Arthur and Cornell. It was less bitter perhaps than that
in the contest with Fenton over the confirmation of Thomas Murphy, but
no less carefully worked up and quite as successful. To the
consternation of the Administration, which relied upon a solid
Democratic party, the Senator won by a decisive vote, having the
support of several Democrats and of all the Republicans except five.</p>

<p>It was an important victory for Conkling, who must soon begin another
canvass for members of the Legislature. It sent a thrill of joy
through the ranks of his friends, renewed the courage of
office-holding lieutenants, and compelled the Administration's
supporters to admit that the President was &quot;chiefly to blame.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
Moreover, the cordial support given Conkling by Blaine created the
impression that it had led to their complete reconciliation, a belief
strengthened by a conversation that subsequently occurred between them
on the floor of the Senate Chamber in full view of crowded galleries.
David Davis had added to the tableau by putting an arm around each,
thus giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.406" id="Page_iii.406">iii. 406</a></span> meeting the appearance of an unusually friendly
one.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>But the President, if he had previously omitted to say what he meant,
determined not to surrender, and on July 11 (1878), after the
adjournment of Congress, he suspended Arthur and Cornell and appointed
Edwin A. Merritt and Silas W. Burt. Arthur's suspension did not
involve his integrity. Nor was any distinct charge lodged against
Cornell. Their removal rested simply upon the plea that the interests
of the public service demanded it, and the death of Roosevelt very
naturally opened the way for Merritt.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p>All his life Merritt had been serviceable and handy in politics. After
holding successively several local offices in St. Lawrence, the people
sent him to the Assembly in 1859 and in 1860. When the rebellion began
he entered the quartermaster's and commissary departments, and at its
close served as quartermaster-general of the State until appointed
naval officer in 1869, an office which he lost in 1870 when Conkling
got control of the patronage. Then he followed Fenton and Greeley into
the Liberal party, but returning with other leaders in 1874, he
accepted the nomination for State treasurer in 1875, the year when
administrative reform accelerated Tilden's run for the White House.
This made him eligible for surveyor, an office to which he had been
confirmed in December, 1877. His unsought promotion to the
collectorship, however, was a testimonial to his ability. Whatever
Merritt touched he improved. Whether quartermaster, naval officer, or
surveyor, he attended rigorously to duty, enforcing the law fairly and
without favour, and disciplining his force into a high state of
efficiency, so that revenues increased, expenses diminished, and
corruption talk ceased. In selecting him for collector, therefore, the
President had secured the right type of man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Hayes's action roiled the political waters. Conkling's
friends accused the President of violating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.407" id="Page_iii.407">iii. 407</a></span> own principles, of
endeavouring to set up a new machine, and of grossly insulting the
Senator. On the other hand, Administration supporters maintained that
the law authorising removals was as obligatory as that empowering a
senator to advise and consent to appointments, and that in removing
Arthur the President did not insult Conkling any more than Conkling
insulted the President by rejecting the nomination of Roosevelt. This
renewal of an ugly quarrel was auguring ill for the Republicans, when
the organisation of the National Greenback-Labour-Reform party,
suddenly presenting a question which involved the integrity and
welfare of the country, put factional quarrels and personal politics
into eclipse.</p>

<p>Conkling had exhibited both tact and skill in that campaign. He did
not lead the gold column. In fact, it was not until the last moment
that the Saratoga committee on resolutions which he dominated,
substituted &quot;the fixed monetary standard of the commercial world&quot; for
the word &quot;coin.&quot; But after the guide-boards pointed the way he became
a powerful champion of hard money. Besides, the moderation and good
temper with which he discussed the doctrine of the inflationists did
much to hold dissenters within the party and justly entitled him to
high praise. His unanimous re-election to the Senate followed as a
matter of course. Not that unanimity of action implied unanimity of
feeling. It was rather, perhaps, a yielding to the necessity of the
situation.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, to all appearances Conkling had recovered the prestige
lost at Rochester. His conduct at the convention and in the campaign
excited the hope, also, that he would drop his opposition to Merritt
and Burt. Such a course commended itself to the judgment of a large
ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.408" id="Page_iii.408">iii. 408</a></span>jority of the New York delegation in Congress as well as to many
stout legislative friends; but re-election seemed to have hardened his
heart, and when, ten days after that event, he rose in the Senate to
defeat confirmation he exhibited the confidence of the man of
Gath.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>Prior to his re-election Conkling had not voluntarily moved in the
matter. To him the settlement of one thing at a time sufficed. Early
in January, however, the Secretary of the Treasury, on his own
initiative and with the skill of a veteran legislator, had addressed
the President of the Senate, setting forth that Arthur's conduct of
the custom-house was neither efficient nor economical. To this Arthur
answered, denying inattention to business or loss of revenue, and
affirming that he had recommended a system of reform upon which the
Secretary had not acted.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> After the reception of this letter
Conkling demanded immediate action. But the Senate, by two majority,
preferred to wait for Sherman's replication, and when that statement
came the Senate again, by a vote of 35 to 26, put off action until the
document, with its many exhibits, could be carefully examined.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
These delays augured ill for the Senator. It appeared that a
Democratic member of his own committee had left him, and on the day
fixed for consideration other Democrats, while calmly discussing the
matter, disclosed a disposition to desert. Alarmed at their loss
Conkling suddenly moved to recommit, which was carried by a <i>viva
voce</i> vote amidst shouts of approval and whispered assurances that
further action should be deferred until a Democratic Senate convened
on March 4. Then some one demanded the yeas and nays.</p>

<p>Believing the matter practically settled, Conkling, to improve the
last chance &quot;of freeing his mind,&quot; he said, unex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.409" id="Page_iii.409">iii. 409</a></span>pectedly took the
floor, and for more than an hour, with a bitterness and eloquence not
excelled at Rochester, assailed the President and those associated
with him. To illustrate the insincerity of the Administration's desire
to reform the civil service he read several place-seeking letters
addressed to Arthur while collector and written by the President's
private secretary, by a member of the Cabinet, and other reformers.
One letter sought a position for the son of Justice Bradley, who had
figured conspicuously on the Electoral Commission. Such a scene had
never before been witnessed in the Senate. Exclamations of mock
surprise followed by fun-making questions and loud laughter added to
the grotesque exhibition. It was so ludicrous as to become pitiful and
painful. Although no particular harm was done to anybody, the
Government for the moment was made ridiculous.</p>

<p>At times Conkling was blessed with the gift of offence, and on this
occasion he seems to have exercised it to its full capacity. Before he
began speaking the Senate exhibited a readiness to recommit the
nominations, but as he proceeded he lost ground, and when he finished
several Republican senators, unwilling to afford another opportunity
for such a scene, demanded that the matter be disposed of at once and
forever. Each succeeding name, as the roll-call proceeded on the
motion to recommit, showed more and more the change that had taken
place in senators' feelings. Failure to recommit turned defeat into
confusion, and confusion into disaster. When the three roll-calls were
over it was found that Merritt had been confirmed by 33 to 24 and Burt
by 31 to 19. An analysis of the &quot;pairs&quot; increased the rout, since it
disclosed that twenty-five Democrats and fifteen Republicans favoured
confirmation, while only seven Democrats and twenty-three Republicans
opposed it. In other words, the Administration required only five
Democratic votes to match the strength of the dissatisfied
Republicans. Kernan, although he had spoken slightingly of Merritt,
refused to vote, but Blaine, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.410" id="Page_iii.410">iii. 410</a></span> joined heartily in the laughter
provoked by Conkling's thrusts as he read the letters, antagonised the
President. This noticeable desire of the Maine statesman to attach his
fortunes to those of the New York Senator neither escaped the
attention nor faded from the memory of Secretary Sherman.</p>

<p>The next morning everybody knew what had happened. Although secrecy
was removed only from the vote, nothing of the seven hours' conflict
remained untold, the result of which to all New Yorkers proved a great
surprise. They had supposed Conkling invincible in the Senate.
Nevertheless, to most Republicans, whether friends or foes, his defeat
on February 3 was a great relief. Merritt had made an excellent
collector, and a feeling existed, which had crystallised into a strong
public sentiment, that it was unwise to force into his place an
official unsatisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h2>JOHN KELLY ELECTS CORNELL</h2>

<h2>1879</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">If</span> threatened danger had bred an artificial harmony among the
Republican factions of the State in 1878, the presence of a real
peril, growing out of the control of both branches of Congress by the
Democrats, tended to bring them closer together in 1879. During a
special session of the Forty-sixth Congress the Democratic majority
had sought, by a political rider attached to the army appropriation
bill, to repeal objectionable election laws, which provided among
other things for the appointment of supervisors and deputy marshals at
congressional elections. This law had materially lessened cheating in
New York City, and no one doubted that its repeal would be followed in
1880 by scenes similar to those which had disgraced the metropolis
prior to its enactment in 1870.</p>

<p>But the attempt to get rid of the objectionable Act by a rider on a
supply bill meant more than repeal. It implied a threat. In effect the
Democrats declared that if the Executive did not yield his veto power
to a bare majority, the needed appropriations for carrying on the
government would be stopped. This practically amounted to revolution,
and the debate that followed reawakened bitter partisan and sectional
animosities. &quot;Suppose in a separate bill,&quot; said Conkling, &quot;the
majority had, in advance of appropriations, repealed the national bank
act and the resumption act, and had declared that unless the Executive
surrendered his convictions and yielded up his approval of the
repealing act, no appropriations should be made; would the separation
of the bills have palliated or condoned the revolutionary pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.412" id="Page_iii.412">iii. 412</a></span>pose?
When it is intended that, unless another species of legislation is
agreed to, the money of the people, paid for that purpose, shall not
be used to maintain their government, the threat is revolution and its
execution is treasonable.&quot; Then he gave the mortal stab. Of the
ninety-three senators and representatives from the eleven disloyal
States, he said, eighty-five were soldiers in the armies of the
rebellion, and their support of these &quot;revolutionary measures is a
fight for empire. It is a contrivance to clutch the national
government. That we believe; that I believe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> The President, by
advising the country through his spirited veto messages of the
desperate tactics invoked by the majority, added to Northern
indignation.</p>

<p>It was a losing battle to the Democrats. The longer they insisted the
more the Southern brigadiers were held up to public scorn as if they
had again betrayed their country, and when, finally, the appropriation
bills were passed without riders, it left Republicans more firmly
united than at the beginning of the Hayes administration.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>Two months later the Republican State convention, held at Saratoga
(September 3), evidenced this union.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> Every distinguished
Republican of the State was present save Thurlow Weed, whose
feebleness kept him at home. Conkling presided. With fine humour,
George William Curtis, the sound of whose flute-like voice brought a
burst of applause, asked that the crowded aisles be cleared that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.413" id="Page_iii.413">iii. 413</a></span>
might see the chairman. Conkling's speech excited close attention. It
was freer and more vivid because of more human interest than his
address of the year before, and his appeal for harmony, his
denunciation of revolutionary methods in Congress, and his demand that
freedmen be protected in their rights, brought strenuous, purposeful
applause from determined men. The principles thus felicitously and
rhetorically stated formed the basis of the platform, which pledged
the party anew to national supremacy, equal rights, free elections,
and honest money. It also thanked the President for his recent
attitude.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a disposition to contest the strength of the
organisation and its methods boldly asserted itself. For months
Cornell had been Conkling's candidate for governor. A searching
canvass, extended into all sections of the State and penetrating the
secrets of men, had been noiselessly and ceaselessly carried on.
Indeed, a more inquisitorial pursuit had never before been attempted,
since the slightest chance, the merest accident, might result, as it
did in 1876, in defeating Cornell.</p>

<p>So much depended upon the control of the temporary organisation that
the anti-Conkling forces begged the Vice-President to stand for
temporary chairman. They could easily unite upon him, and the belief
obtained that he could defeat the Senator. But Wheeler, a mild and
amiable gentleman, whose honours had come without personal contests,
was timid and unyielding.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> What the opposition needed was a real
State leader. It had within its ranks brilliant editors,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>
excellent lawyers, and with few exceptions the best speakers in the
party, but since Fenton lost control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.414" id="Page_iii.414">iii. 414</a></span> of the organisation no man had
arisen capable of crossing swords with its great chieftain.</p>

<p>Of the four pronounced candidates for governor Frank Hiscock of
Syracuse divided the support of the central counties with Theodore M.
Pomeroy of Cayuga, while William H. Robertson of Westchester and John
H. Starin of New York claimed whatever delegates Cornell did not
control in the metropolis and its vicinity. Among them and their
lieutenants, however, none could dispute leadership with Conkling and
his corps of able managers. Starin had pluck and energy, but two terms
in Congress and popularity with the labouring classes, to whom he paid
large wages and generously contributed fresh-air enjoyments, summed up
his strength.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> Pomeroy was better known. His public record, dating
from the famous speech made in the Whig convention of 1855, had kept
him prominently before the people, and had he continued in Congress he
must have made an exalted national reputation. But the day of younger
men had come. Besides, his recent vote for John F. Smyth, the head of
the Insurance Department, injured him.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Robertson, as usual, had
strong support. His long public career left a clear imprint of his
high character, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.415" id="Page_iii.415">iii. 415</a></span> his attractive personality, with its restrained
force, made him a central figure in the politics of the State.</p>

<p>Hiscock was then on the threshold of his public career. He began life
as the law partner and political lieutenant of his brother, Harris, an
adroit politician, whose violent death in 1867, while a member of the
constitutional convention, left to the former the Republican
leadership of Onondaga County. If his diversion as a Liberal
temporarily crippled him, it did not prevent his going to Congress in
1876, where he was destined to remain for sixteen years and to achieve
high rank as a debater on financial questions. He was without a sense
of humour and possessed rather an austere manner, but as a highly
successful lawyer he exhibited traits of character that strengthened
him with the people. He was also an eminently wary and cautious man,
alive to the necessity of watching the changeful phases of public
opinion, and slow to propound a plan until he had satisfied himself
that it could be carried out in practice. It increased his influence,
too, that he was content with a stroke of practical business here and
there in the interest of party peace without claiming credit for any
brilliant or deep diplomacy.</p>

<p>It is doubtful, however, if the genius of a Weed could have induced
the disorganised forces, representing the four candidates, to put up a
single opponent to Cornell. Such a course, in the opinion of the
leaders, would release delegates to the latter without compensating
advantage. It was decided, therefore, to hold the field intact with
the hope of preventing a nomination on the first ballot, and to let
the result determine the next step. In their endeavour to accomplish
this they stoutly maintained that Cornell, inheriting the unpopularity
of the machine, could not carry the State. To win New York and thus
have its position defined for 1880 was the one great desire of
Republicans, and the visible effect of the fusionists' attack,
concededly made with great tact and cleverness, if without much effort
at organisation, turned Conkling's confidence into doubt. Then he put
on more pressure. In the preceding winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.416" id="Page_iii.416">iii. 416</a></span> Pomeroy's vote and speech
in the State Senate had saved John F. Smyth from deserved impeachment,
and he now counted confidently upon the Commissioner's promised
support of his candidacy. But Conkling demanded it for Cornell, and
Smyth left Pomeroy to care for himself.</p>

<p>It is seldom that a roll-call ever proceeded under such tension.
Nominating speeches were abandoned, cheers for the platform faded into
an ominous silence, and every response sounded like the night-step of
a watchful sentinel. Only when some conspicuous leader voted was the
stillness broken. A score of men were keeping count, and halfway down
the roll the fusionists tied their opponents. When, at last, the call
closed with nine majority for Cornell, the result, save a spasm of
throat-splitting yells, was received with little enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> On
the motion to make the nomination unanimous George William Curtis
voted &quot;No&quot; distinctly.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>It was a Conkling victory. For three days delegates had crowded the
Senator's headquarters, while in an inner room he strengthened the
weak, won the doubtful, and directed his forces with remarkable skill.
He asked no quarter, and after his triumph every candidate selected
for a State office was an avowed friend of Cornell. &quot;It would have
been poor policy,&quot; said one of the Senator's lieutenants, &quot;to
apologise for what he had done by seeming to strengthen the ticket
with open enemies of the chief candidate.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>The aftermath multiplied reasons for the coalition's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.417" id="Page_iii.417">iii. 417</a></span> downfall. Some
thought the defeat of Cornell in 1876 deceived the opposition as to
his strength; others, that a single candidate should have opposed him;
others, again, that the work of securing delegates did not begin early
enough. But all agreed that the action of George B. Sloan of Oswego
seriously weakened them. Since 1874 Sloan had been prominently
identified with the unfettered wing of the party. Indeed, his activity
along lines of reform had placed him at the head and front of
everything that made for civic betterment. In character he resembled
Robertson. His high qualities and flexibility of mind gave him
unrivalled distinction. He possessed a charm which suffused his
personality as a smile softens and irradiates a face, and although it
was a winsome rather than a commanding personality, it lacked neither
firmness nor power. Moreover, he was a resourceful business man, keen,
active, and honest&#8212;characteristics which he carried with him into
public life. His great popularity made him speaker of the Assembly in
the third year of his service (1877), and his ability to work
tactfully and effectively had suggested his name to the coalition as a
compromise candidate for governor. He had never leaned to the side of
the machine. In fact, his failure to win the speakership in the
preceding January was due to the opposition of Cornell backed by John
F. Smyth, and his hopes of future State preferment centred in the
defeat of these aggressive men. Yet at the critical moment, when
success seemed within the grasp of his old-time friends, he voted for
Cornell. For this his former associates never wholly forgave him. Nor
was his motive ever fully understood. Various reasons found
currency&#8212;admiration of Conkling, a desire to harmonise his party at
home by the nomination of John C. Churchill for State comptroller, and
weariness of opposing an apparently invincible organisation. But
whatever the motive the coalition hissed when he declared his choice,
and then turned upon Churchill like a pack of sleuth-hounds, defeating
him upon the first ballot in spite of Conkling's assistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.418" id="Page_iii.418">iii. 418</a></span></p>

<p>Tammany's threat to bolt Robinson's renomination may have encouraged
Cornell's nomination, since such truancy would aid his election. John
Kelly was <i>in extremis</i>. Tammany desertions and the election of Mayor
Cooper had shattered his control of the city. To add to his
discomfiture the Governor had removed Henry A. Gumbleton, charged with
taking monstrous fees as clerk of New York County, and appointed
Hubert O. Thompson in his place. Gumbleton was Kelly's pet; Thompson
was Cooper's lieutenant. Although the Governor sufficiently justified
his action, the exercise of this high executive function was generally
supposed to be only a move in the great Presidential game of 1880. His
failure to remove the Register, charged with similar misdoings,
strengthened the supposition that the Tilden camp fires were burning
brightly. But whatever the Governor's motive, Kelly accepted
Gumbleton's removal as an open declaration of war, and on September 6
(1879), five days before the Democratic State convention, Tammany's
committee on organisation secretly declared &quot;that in case the
convention insists upon the renomination of Lucius Robinson for
governor, the Tammany delegation will leave in a body.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> In
preparation for this event an agent of Tammany hired Shakespeare Hall,
the only room left in Syracuse of sufficient size to accommodate a
bolting convention.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p>The changes visible in the alignment of factions since the Democrats
had selected a candidate for governor in Syracuse reflected the fierce
struggle waged in the intervening five years. In 1874 Tweed was in
jail; Kelly, standing for Tilden, assailed Sanford E. Church as a
friend of the canal ring; Dorsheimer, thrust into the Democratic party
through the Greeley revolt, was harvesting honour in high office;
Bigelow, dominated by his admiration of a public servant who concealed
an unbridled ambition, gave character to the so-called reform; and
Charles S. Fairchild, soon to appreciate the ingratitude of party, was
building a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.419" id="Page_iii.419">iii. 419</a></span> as the undismayed prosecutor of a predatory
ring. Now, Tweed was in his grave; Kelly had joined the canal ring in
sounding the praises of Church; Dorsheimer, having drifted into
Tammany and the editorship of the <i>Star</i>, disparaged the man whom he
adored as governor and sought to make President; and Bigelow and
Fairchild, their eyes opened, perhaps, by cipher telegrams, found
satisfaction in the practice of their professions.</p>

<p>But Tilden was not without friends. If some had left him, others had
grown more potent. For several years Daniel E. Manning, known to his
Albany neighbours as a youth of promise and a young man of ripening
wisdom, had attracted attention by his genius for political
leadership.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> He seems never to have been rash or misled. Even an
exuberance of animal vitality that eagerly sought new outlets for its
energy did not waste itself in aimless experiments. Although
possessing the generosity of a rich nature, he preferred to work
within lines of purpose without heady enthusiasms or reckless
extremes, and his remarkable gifts as an executive, coupled with the
study of politics as a fine art, soon made him a manager of men. This
was demonstrated in his aggressive fight against Tweedism. Manning was
now (1879) forty-eight years old. It cannot be said that he had then
reached the place filled by Dean Richmond, or that the <i>Argus</i> wielded
the power exerted in the days of Edwin Croswell; but the anti-ring
forces in the interior of the State cheerfully mustered under his
leadership, while the <i>Argus</i>, made forceful and attractive by the
singularly brilliant and facile pen of St. Clair McKelway, swayed the
minds of its readers to a degree almost unequalled among its party
contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.420" id="Page_iii.420">iii. 420</a></span></p><p>Manning took charge of the interests of Robinson, who did not attend
the convention, receiving Kelly's tactful and spirited assault with
fine courage. The Governor's enemies were more specific than
Cornell's. They predicted that Robinson's renomination would lose
twenty thousand votes in New York City alone, and an ingenious and
extensively circulated table showed that the counties represented by
his delegates had recently exhibited a Democratic loss of thirty
thousand and an increased Republican vote of forty thousand, while
localities opposed to him revealed encouraging gains. Mindful of the
havoc wrought in 1874 by connecting Church with the canal ring, Kelly
also sought to crush Robinson by charging that corporate rings,
notably the New York Mutual Life Insurance Company, had controlled his
administration, and that although he had resigned from the Erie
directorate at the time of his election, he still received large fees
through his son who acted as attorney for the road. Moreover, Kelly
intimated, with a dark frown, that he had another stone in his sling.
This onslaught, made upon every country delegate in town, seemed to
confuse if not to shake the Tilden men, whose interest centred in
success as well as in Robinson. The hesitation of the Kings County
delegation, under the leadership of Hugh McLaughlin, to declare
promptly for the Governor, and the toying of Senator Kernan with the
name of Church while talking in the interest of harmony, indicated
irresolution. Even David B. Hill and Edward K.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.421" id="Page_iii.421">iii. 421</a></span> Apgar, who desired to
shape affairs for a pledged delegation to the next national
convention, evidenced weariness.</p>

<p>Manning steadied the line. In proclaiming Robinson's nomination on the
first ballot he anticipated every movement of the enemy. He knew that
Henry W. Slocum's candidacy did not appeal to McLaughlin; that Chief
Justice Church's consent rested upon an impossible condition; and that
Kelly's threatened bolt, however disastrously it might end in
November, would strengthen Robinson in the convention. Nevertheless,
unusual concessions showed a desire to proceed on lines of harmony.
Tammany's delegation was seated with the consent of Irving Hall; John
C. Jacobs, a senator from Brooklyn, was made chairman; the fairness of
committee appointments allayed suspicion; a platform accepted by if
not inoffensive to all Democrats set forth the principles of the
party,<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> and an avoidance of irritating statements characterised
the speeches placing Robinson's name in nomination.</p>

<p>Tammany's part was less cleverly played. Its effort centred in
breaking the solid Brooklyn delegation, and although with much tact it
presented Slocum as its candidate for governor, and cunningly
expressed confidence in Jacobs by proposing that he select the
Committee on Credentials, two Bowery orators, with a fierceness born
of hate, abused Robinson and pronounced Tilden &quot;the biggest fraud of
the age.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> Then Dorsheimer took the floor. His purpose was to
capture the Kings and Albany delegations, and walking down the aisles
with stage strides he begged them, in a most impassioned manner, to
put themselves in Tammany's place, and to say whether, under like
circumstances, they would not adopt the same course. He did it very
adroitly. His eyes blazed, his choice words blended entreaty with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.422" id="Page_iii.422">iii. 422</a></span>
reasoning, and his manner indicated an earnestness that captivated if
it did not convert. His declaration, however, that Tammany would bolt
Robinson's renomination withered the effect of his rhetoric. Kelly had
insinuated as much, and Tammany had flouted it for two days; but
Dorsheimer's announcement was the first authoritative declaration, and
it hardened the hearts of men who repudiated such methods.</p>

<p>Then the tricksters had their inning. Pending a motion that a
committee of one from each county be appointed to secure harmony, a
Saratoga delegate moved that John C. Jacobs be nominated for governor
by acclamation. This turned the convention into a pandemonium. In the
midst of the whirlwind of noise a Tammany reading clerk, putting the
motion, declared it carried. Similar tactics had won Horatio Seymour
the nomination for President in 1868, and for a time it looked as if
the Chair might profit by their repetition. Jacobs was a young man.
Ambition possessed and high office attracted him. But if a vision of
the governorship momentarily unsettled his mind, one glance at
McLaughlin and the Brooklyn delegation, sitting like icebergs in the
midst of the heated uproar, restored his reason. When a motion to
recess increased the tumult, Rufus H. Peckham, a cool Tilden man,
called for the ayes and noes. This brought the convention to earth
again, and as the noise subsided Jacobs reproved the clerk for his
unauthorised assumption of the Chair's duties, adding, with a slight
show of resentment, that had he been consulted respecting the
nomination he should have respectfully declined.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the roll-call the Tammany tellers, adding the
aggregate vote to suit the needs of the occasion, pronounced the
motion carried, while others declared it lost. A second call defeated
a recess by 166 to 217. On a motion to table the appointment of a
harmony committee the vote stood 226 to 155. A motion to adjourn also
failed by 166 to 210. These results indicated that neither tricks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.423" id="Page_iii.423">iii. 423</a></span> nor
disorder could shake the Robinson phalanx, and after the call to
select a nominee for governor had begun, Augustus Schell, John Kelly,
William Dorsheimer, and other Tammany leaders rose in their places.
&quot;Under no circumstances will the Democracy of New York support the
nomination of Lucius Robinson,&quot; said Schell; &quot;but the rest of the
ticket will receive its warm and hearty support.&quot; Then he paused.
Kelly, standing in the background of the little group, seemed to
shrink from the next step. Regularity was the touchstone of Tammany's
creed. Indifference to ways and means gave no offence, but
disobedience to the will of a caucus or convention admitted of no
forgiveness. Would Kelly himself be the first to commit this
unpardonable sin? He could invoke no precedent to shield him. In 1847
the Wilmot Proviso struck the key-note of popular sentiment, and the
Barnburners, leaving the convention the instant the friends of the
South repudiated the principle, sought to stay the aggressiveness of
slavery. Nor could he appeal to party action in 1853, for the Hunkers
refused to enter the convention after the Barnburners had organised
it. Moreover, he was wholly without excuse. He had accepted the
platform, participated in all proceedings, and exhausted argument,
diplomacy, trickery, and deception. Not until certain defeat faced him
did he rise to go, and even then he tarried with the hope that
Schell's words would bring the olive-branch. It was a moment of
intense suspense. The convention, sitting in silence, realised that
the loss meant probable defeat, and anxious men, unwilling to take
chances, looked longingly from one leader to another. But the symbol
of peace did not appear, and Schell announced, as he led the way to
the door: &quot;The delegation from New York will now retire from the
hall.&quot; Then cheers and hisses deadened the tramp of retreating
footsteps.</p>

<p>After the bolters' departure Irving Hall took the seats of Tammany,
and the convention quickly closed its work. The roll-call showed 301
votes cast, of which Robinson received 243 and Slocum 56. Little
conflict occurred in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.424" id="Page_iii.424">iii. 424</a></span> selection of other names on the ticket, all
the candidates save the lieutenant-governor being renominated.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p>In the evening Tammany occupied Shakespeare Hall. David Dudley Field,
formerly a zealous anti-slavery Republican, and more recently Tilden's
counsel before the Electoral Commission, presided; Dorsheimer, whose
grotesque position must have appealed to his own keen sense of the
humorous, moved the nomination of John Kelly for governor; and Kelly,
in his speech of acceptance, prophesied the defeat of Governor
Robinson. This done they went out into darkness.</p>

<p>Throughout the campaign the staple of Republican exhortations was the
Southern question and the need of a &quot;strong man.&quot; Even Conkling in his
one speech made no reference to State politics or State affairs. When
Cornell's election, midway in the canvass, seemed assured, Curtis
argued that his success would defeat the party in 1880, and to avoid
such a calamity he advocated &quot;scratching the ticket.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> Several
well-known Republicans, adopting the suggestion, published an address,
giving reasons for their refusal to support the head and the tail of
the ticket. They cited the cause of Cornell's dismissal from the
custom-house; compared the cost of custom-house administration before
and after his separation from the service; and made unpleasant
reference to the complicity of Soule in the canal frauds, as revealed
in the eleventh report of the Canal Investigating Committee.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
Immediately the signers were dubbed &quot;Scratchers.&quot; The party press
stigmatised them as traitors, and several journals refused to publish
their address even as an advertisement. So bitterly was Curtis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.425" id="Page_iii.425">iii. 425</a></span>
assailed that he thought it necessary to resign the chairmanship of
the Richmond County convention. Party wits also ridiculed him. Henry
Ward Beecher said, with irresistible humour, that scratching is good
for cutaneous affections. Martin I. Townsend declared that no
Republican lived in Troy who had any disease that required scratching.
Evarts called it &quot;voting in the air.&quot; To all this Curtis replied that
the incessant fusillade proved his suggestion not so utterly
contemptible as it was alleged to be. &quot;If the thing be a mosquito,
there is too much powder and ball wasted upon it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the speech of the Secretary of State cut deeply. Evarts
represented an Administration which had removed Cornell that &quot;the
office may be properly and efficiently administered.&quot; Now, he endorsed
him for governor, ridiculed Republicans that opposed him, and pointed
unmistakably to Grant as the &quot;strong man&quot; who could best maintain the
power of the people.<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> The <i>Nation</i> spoke of Evarts' appearance as
&quot;indecent.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> Curtis was not less severe. &quot;Both his appearance and
his speech are excellent illustrations of the reason why the political
influence of so able and excellent a man is so slight. Mr. Evarts,
musing on the folly of voting in the air, may remember the arrow of
which the poet sings, which was shot into the air and found in the
heart of an oak. It is hearts of oak, not of bending reeds, that make
and save parties.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p>Talk of a secret alliance between Tammany and the Cornell managers
began very early in the campaign. Perhaps the fulsome praise of John
Kelly in Republican journals, the constant support of John F. Smyth by
Tammany senators, and Kelly's avowed intention to defeat Robinson,
were sufficient to arouse suspicion. Conkling's sudden silence as to
the danger threatening free elections, of which he declaimed so warmly
in April, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.426" id="Page_iii.426">iii. 426</a></span> to indicate undue satisfaction with existing
conditions. To several newspapers the action of two Republican police
commissioners, who championed Tammany's right to its share of poll
inspectors, pointed unmistakably to a bargain, since it gave Tammany
and the Republicans power to select a chairman at each poll.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>
Evidence of a real alliance, however, was nebulous. The defeat of
Robinson meant the election of Cornell, and Republicans naturally
welcomed any effort to accomplish it. They greeted Kelly, during his
tour of the State, with noise and music, crowded his meetings, and
otherwise sought to dishearten Robinson's friends. Although Kelly's
speeches did not compare in piquancy with his printed words, his
references to Tilden as the &quot;old humbug of Cipher Alley&quot; and to
Robinson as having &quot;sore eyes&quot; when signing bills, kept his hearers
expectant and his enemies disturbed. The <i>World</i> followed him,
reporting his speeches as &quot;failures&quot; and his audiences as &quot;rushing
pell-mell from the building.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>Kelly did not mean to dish the whole Democratic ticket. He expected to
elect the minor State officers. But he learned on the morning after
election that he had entirely miscalculated the effect of his scheme,
since every Democrat except the nephew of Horatio Seymour rested in
the party morgue by the side of Lucius Robinson.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.427" id="Page_iii.427">iii. 427</a></span> the city
Kelly also disappointed his followers. His own vote ran behind
Robinson's, and all his friends were slaughtered. Indeed, when Tammany
surrendered its regularity at Syracuse it lost its voting strength.
Even Cornell whom it saved ran 20,000 behind his ticket. The election
was, in fact, a triumph for nobody except Conkling. He had put into
the highest State office a personal adherent, whom the Administration
had stigmatised by dismissal; he had brought to New York his principal
opponents in the Cabinet (Evarts and Sherman) to speak for his nominee
and their dismissed servant; and he had induced the Administration to
call for a &quot;strong man&quot; for the Presidency.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

<h2>STALWART AND HALF-BREED</h2>

<h2>1880</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> General Grant made his tour around the world there was much
speculation respecting his renomination for the Presidency. Very
cautiously started on the ground of necessity because of the attitude
of the Southerners in Congress, the third-term idea continued to
strengthen until the widespread and deep interest in the great
soldier's home-coming was used to create the belief that he was
unmistakably the popular choice. Grant himself had said nothing
publicly upon the subject except in China, and his proper and modest
allusions to it then added to the people's respect. But during the
welcome extended him at Philadelphia, the Mayor of that city disclosed
a well-laid plan to make him a candidate. This frank declaration
indicated also that Grant expected the nomination, if, indeed, he was
not a party to the scheme for securing it.</p>

<p>The question of discrediting the traditions quickly became a serious
one, and its discussion, stimulated by other aspirants for the
Presidency, took a wide range. The opponents of a third term did not
yield to any in their grateful remembrance and recognition of what
Grant had done for the country, but they deemed it impolitic upon both
public and party grounds. If the tradition of two terms be overthrown
because of his distinguished service, they argued, his election for a
fourth term, to which the Constitution offered no bar, could be urged
for the same reason with still more cogency. Such apparently logical
action would not only necessarily familiarise the public mind, already
disturbed by the increasing depression to business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.429" id="Page_iii.429">iii. 429</a></span> caused by the
turmoil incident to quadrennial elections, with the idea of a
perpetual Presidency, but it would foster confidence in personal
government, and encourage the feeling that approved experience, as in
the case of trusted legislators, is necessary to the continuance of
wise administration.</p>

<p>Party reasons also furnished effective opposition. German voters,
especially in New York and Wisconsin, early disclosed an indisposition
to accept Grant even if nominated, while the Independent or Scratcher
voiced a greater hostility than the Cornell nomination had excited.
Never before had so much attention been given to a political question
by persons ordinarily indifferent to such speculation. Anti-Grant
clubs, springing up in a night, joined the press in ridiculing the
persistent talk about the need of &quot;a strong man,&quot; and charged that the
scheme was conceived by a coterie of United States senators, managed
by former office-holders under President Grant, and supported by men
who regarded the Hayes administration as an impertinence. Matthew
Hale, in accepting the presidency of the Albany Club, declared the
movement to be at war with American traditions and with the spirit of
American institutions.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Such acrimonious antagonism quickly uncovered the purpose of the
Stalwarts, who now sought to control the nomination regardless of
opposition. For this purpose unusually early conventions for the
selection of delegates to the National Convention, to be held at
Chicago on June 2, were called in Pennsylvania, New York, and other
States. Pennsylvania's was fixed for February 4 at Harrisburg, and New
York's for the 25th at Utica. Like methods obtained in the selection
of delegates. At Albany John F. Smyth issued a call in the evening for
primaries to be held the next day at noon, and furnished his followers
with pink coloured tickets, headed &quot;Grant.&quot; Smyth was already in bad
odour. Governor Robinson had accused him of compelling illegal
payments by insurance companies of a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.430" id="Page_iii.430">iii. 430</a></span> sum of money, to which he
replied that the act making it illegal was unconstitutional, although
no court had so pronounced. His misdemeanour was confirmed in the
public mind by the fact, elicited on the impeachment trial, that the
money so obtained had been divided among agents of the Republican
organisation. Indeed, the <i>Times</i> charged, without reservation, that
in one case the place of division was in none other than the house of
Cornell himself.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> Although the Senate of 1878 and of 1879 failed
to remove Smyth, the Senate of 1880, notwithstanding his reappointment
by Governor Cornell, refused to confirm him.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> In the presence of
such a sorry record the ostracised Albany Republicans were not
surprised at his attempt to cheat them at the primaries, and their
indignation at the shameless procedure resounded through the State. At
the end of a week Charles Emory Smith, the gifted editor of the Albany
<i>Journal</i>, who headed the delegation thus selected, deemed it
expedient to withdraw. Five associates did likewise. Nevertheless, the
opponents of a third term refused to participate in a second election,
called to fill the vacancies, since it did not remove the taint from
the majority who refused to resign.</p>

<p>In reward for his defence of Smyth, if not to express contempt for the
Albany malcontents, Charles Emory Smith was made chairman of the Utica
convention. This evidenced Conkling's complete control. Smith had
lived in Albany since early boyhood. He passed from its Academy to
Union College, thence back to the Academy as a teacher, and from that
position to the editorship of the <i>Express</i>. In a few years his clear,
incisive English, always forcible, often eloquent, had advanced him to
the editorship of the <i>Evening Journal</i>. Singularly attractive in
person, with slender, agile form, sparkling eyes, and ruddy cheeks,
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.431" id="Page_iii.431">iii. 431</a></span> adorned whatever place he held. Indeed, the beauty and strength of
his character, coupled with the esteem in which Republican leaders
held him as a counsellor, gave him in the seventies a position in the
politics of the State somewhat akin to that held by Henry J. Raymond
in the sixties. He did not then, if ever, belong in Raymond's class as
a journalist or as an orator. Nor did he possess the vehement desire
for office that distinguished the brilliant editor of the <i>Times</i>. But
Smith's admirable temper, his sweet disposition, and his rare faculty
for saying things without offence, kept him, like Raymond, on friendly
terms with all. His part was not always an easy one. Leaders changed
and new issues appeared, yet his pen, though sometimes crafty, was
never dipped in gall. While acting as secretary for Governor Fenton he
enjoyed the esteem of Edwin D. Morgan, and if his change from the
Albany <i>Express</i> to the Albany <i>Journal</i> in 1870, and from the
<i>Journal</i> to the Philadelphia <i>Press</i> in 1880, carried him from
Fenton's confidence into Conkling's embrace and converted him from an
ardent third-termer to a champion of Blaine, the bad impression of
this prestidigitation was relieved, if not excused or forgotten,
because of his journalistic promotion.</p>

<p>In State conventions, too, Smith played the part formerly assigned to
Raymond, becoming by common consent chairman of the Committee on
Resolutions. His ear went instinctively to the ground, and, aided by
Carroll E. Smith of the Syracuse <i>Journal</i>, he wrote civil service
reform into the platform of 1877, the principle of sound money into
that of 1878, and carefully shaded important parts of other platforms
in that eventful decade.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> In like manner, al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.432" id="Page_iii.432">iii. 432</a></span>though a pronounced
champion of Conkling and the politics he represented, Smith encouraged
moderate policies, urged frank recognition of the just claims of the
minority, and sought to prevent the stalwart managers from too widely
breaching the proprieties that should govern political organisations.
If his efforts proved unavailing, it seemed that he had at least
mastered the art of being regular without being bigoted, and of living
on good terms with a machine whose methods he could not wholly
approve. Nevertheless, there came a time when his associations, as in
the career of Raymond, seriously injured him, since his toleration and
ardent defence of John F. Smyth, besides grieving sincere friends and
temporarily clouding his young life,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> dissolved his relations with
a journal that he loved, and which, under his direction, had reminded
its readers of the forceful days of Thurlow Weed. Fortunately, the
offer of the editorship of the Philadelphia <i>Press</i>, coming
contemporaneously with his separation from the Albany <i>Journal</i>, gave
him an honourable exit from New York, and opened not only a larger
sphere of action but a more distinguished career.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>Having control of the convention Conkling boldly demanded the adoption
of a resolution instructing &quot;the delegates to use their most earnest
and united efforts to secure the nomination of Ulysses S. Grant.&quot; The
admirers of Blaine seemed unprepared for such a contest. The meagre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.433" id="Page_iii.433">iii. 433</a></span>
majority given Grant at the Pennsylvania convention had greatly
encouraged them, but the intervening three weeks afforded insufficient
time to gather their strength. Besides, no one then suspected the
overwhelming public sentiment against a third term which was soon to
sweep the country. As it was no one seemed to have definite plans or a
precise knowledge of how to proceed or what to do, while local leaders
frittered away their strength in petty quarrels which had little
bearing upon the question of Presidential candidates. Finally, an
amendment simply endorsing the nominee of the Chicago convention was
offered as a substitute for the Grant resolution.</p>

<p>The Stalwarts, with the steadiness of veterans conscious of their
strength, deftly, almost delicately, in fact, silenced the minority.
Only once, when the reader of the resolutions hesitated over an
illegible word, did the dramatic happen. At that moment a thin voice
in the gallery exclaimed, &quot;Hurrah for Blaine!&quot; Instantly the audience
was on fire. The burst of applause brought out by Smith's opening
reference to the &quot;never vanquished hero of Appomattox&quot; had been
disappointing because it lacked spontaneity and enthusiasm, but the
sound of the magic word &quot;Blaine,&quot; like a spark flying to powder, threw
the galleries into a flame of cheering which was obstinate in dying
out. Conkling, in closing the debate on the resolution, showed his
customary audacity by hurling bitter sarcasm at the people who had
presumed to applaud. It was in this address that he recited Raleigh's
famous line from <i>The Silent Lover</i>: &quot;The shallows murmur but the
deeps are dumb.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>Conkling's purpose was to put district delegates upon their honour to
obey the convention's instructions regardless of the preference of
their districts. He did it very adroitly, arguing that a delegate is
an agent with a principal behind him, whom he represents if he is
faithful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.434" id="Page_iii.434">iii. 434</a></span> &quot;For what is this convention held?&quot; he asked. &quot;Is it merely
to listen while the delegates from the several congressional districts
inform the convention who the districts are going to send to the
national convention? Is it for that five hundred men, the selected
pride of the Republican party of this State, have come here to meet
together? I think not. Common sense and the immemorial usages of both
parties answer the question. What is the use of a delegate? Is it a
man to go to a convention representing others, and then determine as
he individually prefers what he will do? Let me say frankly that if
any man, however much I respect him, were presented to this convention
who would prove recreant to its judgment, I would never vote for him
as a delegate to any convention.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>Earlier in the day Newton M. Curtis of St. Lawrence, the one-eyed hero
of Fort Fisher, had insisted with much vehemence that district
delegates represented the views of their immediate constituents and
not those of the State convention. Others as stoutly maintained the
same doctrine. But after Conkling had concluded no one ventured to
repeat the claim.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> Indeed, when the several districts reported
their delegates, the Stalwarts openly called upon the suspected ones
to say whether they submitted to the instructions. Woodin and Curtis
voluntarily surrendered. Thus the Grant forces accomplished by
indirection what prudence deterred them from doing boldly and with a
strong hand.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>What the managers gained by indirection, however, they lost in
prestige. If the Harrisburg convention punctured the assumption that
the people demanded Grant's nomination, the Utica assembly destroyed
it, since the majority of thirty-three indicated an entire absence of
spontaneity. Moreover, the convention had scarcely adjourned before
its work became a target. George William Curtis declared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.435" id="Page_iii.435">iii. 435</a></span>
assertion &quot;audacious&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; that a district delegate was an
agent of the State convention, claiming that when the latter
relinquished the right to select it abandoned the right to instruct.
Furthermore, the National Convention, the highest tribunal of the
party, had decided, he said, that State instructions did not bind
district delegates.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> The <i>Tribune</i>, voicing the sentiment of the
major part of the Republican press, thought the convention had clearly
exceeded its power. &quot;It was the right of the majority to instruct the
delegates-at-large,&quot; it said, &quot;but it had no right to compel district
delegates to vote against their consciences and the known wishes of
their constituents.&quot; This led to the more important question whether
delegates, pledged without authority, ought to observe such
instructions. &quot;No man chosen to represent a Blaine district can vote
for Grant and plead the convention's resolution in justification of
his course,&quot; continued the <i>Tribune</i>, which closed with serving notice
upon delegates to correct their error as speedily as possible, &quot;since
a delegate who disobeys the instructions of his constituents will find
himself instantly retired from public life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>As the campaign waxed warmer and the success of Grant seemed more
certain if Pennsylvania and New York voted under the unit rule, the
pressure to create a break in those States steadily increased. The
Stalwarts rested their case upon the regularity of the procedure and
the delegates' acceptance of the instructions after their election.
&quot;They accepted both commissions and instructions,&quot; said the <i>Times</i>,
&quot;with every protestation that they were bound by their sacred honour
to obey the voice of the people as expressed by the traditional and
accepted methods.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> On the other hand, the Blaine delegates relied
upon the decision of the last National Convention, which held that
where a State convention had instructed its delegation to vote as a
unit, each delegate had the right to vote for his individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.436" id="Page_iii.436">iii. 436</a></span>
preference. &quot;My selection as a delegate,&quot; said Woodin, &quot;was the act of
the delegates representing my congressional district, and the State
convention has ratified and certified that act to the National
Convention. Our commissions secure the right to act, and our
conventions guarantee freedom of choice without restraint or
fetters.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<p>Woodin was the most courageous if not the ablest opponent of Conkling
in the convention. He may not have been an organiser of the machine
type, but he was a born ruler of men. Robust, alert, florid, with
square forehead, heavy brows, and keen blue eyes, he looked determined
and fearless. His courage, however, was not the rashness of an
impetuous nature. It was rather the proud self-confidence of a rugged
character which obstacles roused to a higher combative energy. He was
not eloquent; not even ornate in diction. But his voice, his words,
and his delivery were all adequate. Besides, he possessed the
incomparable gift of reserved power. During his career of ten years in
the State Senate he was unquestionably the strongest man in the
Legislature and the designated as well as the real leader for more
than half a decade. He was not intolerant, seldom disclosing his
powers of sarcasm, or being betrayed, even when excited, into angry or
bitter words. Yet he was extremely resolute and tenacious, and must
have been the undisputed leader of the anti-Conkling forces save for
the pitch that many said defiled him. If he yielded it was not proven.
Nevertheless, it tended to mildew his influence.</p>

<p>It was evident from the speech of Woodin that the anti-Grant forces
had the reasonableness of the argument, but the acceptance of the
Utica instructions put delegates in a delicate position. To say that
Conkling had &quot;tricked&quot; them into a pledge which the convention had no
authority to exact,<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> did not explain how a personal pledge could
be avoided. Finally, William H. Robertson, a delegate from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.437" id="Page_iii.437">iii. 437</a></span> the
Twelfth District, who had not appeared at Utica, published a letter
that he should vote for Blaine &quot;because he is the choice of the
Republicans of the district which I represent.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> Two days
afterwards John Birdsall of the First District and Loren B. Sessions
of the Thirty-third announced on the floor of the Senate that they
should do likewise. Woodin said that as he could not reconcile a vote
for some candidate other than Grant with his attitude voluntarily
taken at Utica he should let his alternate go to Chicago.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> From
time to time other delegates followed with declarations similar to
Robertson's.</p>

<p>As expected, this disobedience drew a volley of anathemas upon the
offending delegates, who became known as &quot;Half-breeds.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> The
<i>Times</i> thought Robertson's &quot;tardy revolt&quot; dictated by
&quot;self-interest,&quot; because &quot;the pliant politician from Westchester had
chafed under a sense of disappointed ambition ever since the defeat of
his nomination for governor in 1872.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p>Upon Sessions and Woodin it was more severe. &quot;We have never regarded
State Senator Sessions as a type of all that is corrupt in politics at
Albany,&quot; it said, &quot;and we have steadily defended Mr. Woodin against
the attacks made upon him on the testimony of Tweed. But if these
recent accessions to the Blaine camp are half as bad as the <i>Tribune</i>
has painted them in the past, that journal and its candidate must have
two as disreputable allies as could be found outside of state
prison.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> Woodin's manner of avoiding his Utica pledge seemed to
arouse more indignation than the mere breaking of it. The <i>Times</i>
called it &quot;a sneaking fashion,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> and charged lack of courage. &quot;He
does not believe that he who performs an act through another is
himself responsible for the act.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.438" id="Page_iii.438">iii. 438</a></span></p><p>At Chicago the principle of district representation became the
important question. It involved the admission of many delegates, and
after two days of debate the convention sustained it by a vote of 449
to 306.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> To complete the overthrow of the unit-rule a resolution
was also adopted providing that when any delegate excepted to the
correctness of a vote as cast by the chairman of a delegation, the
president of the convention should direct a roll-call of the
delegation. This practically settled the result. Nevertheless, the
belief obtained, so strong was the Stalwarts' faith in their success,
that when the Blaine and Sherman forces broke to a compromise
candidate, Grant would gain the needed additional seventy-four votes.</p>

<p>Conkling had never before attended a national convention. Indeed, he
had never been seen at a great political gathering west of the
Alleghanies. But he now became the central figure of the convention,
with two-fifths of the delegates rallying under his leadership. His
reception whenever he entered the hall was the remarkable feature of
the great gathering. Nothing like it had occurred in previous national
conventions. Distinguished men representing favourite candidates had
been highly honoured, but never before did the people continue, day
after day, to welcome one with such vociferous acclaim. It was not all
for Grant. The quick spontaneous outburst of applause that shook the
banners hanging from the girders far above, had in it much of
admiration for the stalwart form, the dominant spirit, the iron-nerved
boss, who led his forces with the arrogance of a gifted, courageous
chieftain. His coming seemed planned for dramatic effect. He rarely
appeared until the audience, settled into order by the opening prayer
or by the transaction of business, might easily catch sight of him,
and as he passed down the long aisle, moving steadily on with graceful
stride and immobile face, a flush of pride tinged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.439" id="Page_iii.439">iii. 439</a></span> his cheeks as cheer
after cheer, rolling from one end of the amphitheatre to the other,
rent the air. He sat in the front row on the centre aisle, and about
him clustered Chester A. Arthur, Levi P. Morton, Benjamin F. Tracy,
Edwards Pierrepont, George H. Sharpe, and the boyish figure of Charles
E. Cornell, a pale, sandy, undersized youth, the son of the Governor,
who was represented by an alternate.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>Conkling's presentation of Grant was largely relied upon to gain the
needed votes. Prior to 1876 little importance attached to such
speeches, but after the famous oration of Robert G. Ingersoll at
Cincinnati, which became influential almost to the point of success,
the solicitude exhibited in the selection of dominating speakers
constituted a new phase in convention politics and added immeasurably
to the popular interest. By common consent Conkling was named to
present the Stalwarts' choice, and in most of the qualities desirable
in such an address his was regarded the best of the day.</p>

<p>The lines of Private Miles O'Reilly,<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> suggested to the Senator on
the evening before he spoke, caught the convention as quickly as did
Ingersoll's opening sentences in 1876, and all that followed, save his
sarcasm and flashes of scorn, held the closest attention. &quot;His
unmatched eloquence,&quot; said Brandegee of Connecticut.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> This was the
judgment of an opponent. &quot;It had the warmth of eulogy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.440" id="Page_iii.440">iii. 440</a></span> the finish of
a poem, the force and fire of a philippic,&quot; said the
<i>Inter-Ocean</i>.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> This was the judgment of a friend. All the art of
which he was master found expression in every sentence, polished and
balanced with rhetorical skill, and delivered with the emphasis and
inflection of a great orator. One critic thought it a revelation to
find a man who could be eloquent with studied composure, who could be
fervid without wildness, and who could hold imagery and metaphor to
the steady place of relentless logic without detracting from their
special and peculiar character.</p>

<p>Not content with reciting the achievements of his own candidate,
Conkling seriously weakened his oration as a vote-making speech by
launching shafts of irony first into Sherman and then into Blaine.
&quot;Nobody is really worried about a third term,&quot; he said in conclusion,
&quot;except those hopelessly longing for a first term. Without patronage,
without telegraph wires running from his house to this convention,
without election contrivances, his name is on the country's lips.
Without bureaus, committees, officers, or emissaries to manufacture
sentiment in his favour, without intrigue or effort, Grant is the
candidate whose supporters stand by the creed of the party, holding
the right of the majority as the very essence of their faith, and
meaning to uphold that faith against the charlatans and guerillas,
who, from time to time, deploy and forage between the lines.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> As
these sabre-cuts, dealt with the emphasis of gesture and inflection,
flashed upon the galleries, already charmed with the accomplishment of
his speech and the grace of his sentiment, loud hisses, mingled with
distracting exclamations of banter and dissent, proclaimed that the
spell of his magic was broken.</p>

<p>Balloting for a candidate began on the fifth day. Many rumours
preceded Conkling's method of announcing New York's vote, but when his
turn came, he explained that although he possessed full instructions
concerning the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.441" id="Page_iii.441">iii. 441</a></span> condition of the vote, he thought it better to
call the roll, since several of the delegates preferred to speak for
themselves. This plan, so adroitly submitted, made it impossible to
conceal one's vote behind an anonymous total, and compelled John
Birdsall, the Queens County senator, to lead in the disagreeable duty
of disobeying the instructions of the State convention. Birdsall rose
with hesitation, and, after voting for Blaine in a subdued voice,
dropped quickly into his seat as if anxious to avoid publicity. Then
the convention, having listened in perfect silence, ratified his work
with a chorus of hisses and applause. Gradually the anti-third termers
exhibited more courage, and after Robertson and Husted had called out
their candidate with an emphasis that indicated pride and defiance,
the applause drowned the hisses. Woodin's conduct contrasted sharply
with his usual courage. He was an aggressive member of the opposition,
but at this moment, when brave hearts, unflinching resolve, and
unruffled temper were needed, he stood at the rear of the hall, while
Leander Fitts, his alternate, upon whom he cast the responsibility of
violating a solemnly uttered pledge, feebly pronounced the name
&quot;Blaine.&quot; The result of the roll-call gave Grant 51, Blaine 17, and
Sherman 2.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> On the seventeenth ballot Dennis McCarthy, a State
senator from Onondaga, changed his vote from Grant to Blaine. Thus
modified the New York vote continued until the thirty-sixth ballot,
when the Blaine and Sherman delegates united, recording twenty votes
for Garfield to fifty for Grant. On this roll-call Grant received 306
votes to 399 for Garfield.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> Thus by a strange coincidence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.442" id="Page_iii.442">iii. 442</a></span>
Stalwarts registered the fateful number that marked their strength
when the unit rule was defeated. During the thirty-six roll-calls
Grant's vote varied from 302 to 313, but in the stampede, when two
hundred and fifteen Blaine men and ninety-six supporters of Sherman
rushed into line for Garfield, the faithful 306 went down in defeat
together. These figures justly became an insignia for the heroic.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

<p>After Garfield's nomination the Stalwarts of the New York delegation
did not conceal their disappointment. When everybody else was cheering
they kept their seats, and while others displayed Garfield badges,
they sullenly sought their headquarters to arrange for the
Vice-Presidency. Leaders of the Garfield movement, now eager to
strengthen the ticket, looked to them for a candidate. New York
belonged in the list of doubtful States, and to enlist the men who
seemed to control its destiny they instinctively turned to the
defeated faction. William M. Dennison, a former governor of Ohio,
promptly made their wishes known, confidently counting upon Conkling's
co&#246;peration, since the Senator had been the first on his feet to make
Garfield's nomination unanimous. In doing so he expressed the hope
that the zeal and fervour of the convention would characterise its
members &quot;in bearing the banner and carrying the lances of the
Republican party into the ranks of the enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>Conkling's treatment of Dennison's request has been variously
reported. One version is that he demanded the nomination of Chester A.
Arthur; another, that he sternly refused to make any suggestion.
Contemporary press reports confirm the first, basing it upon his
desire to vindicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.443" id="Page_iii.443">iii. 443</a></span> Arthur and humiliate Sherman; the second is
supported by Alfred R. Conkling's biography of his uncle.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> But
neither report is correct. Conkling bitterly resented Garfield's
nomination, predicted his defeat at the polls, and did not hesitate to
dissuade friends from accepting the nomination for Vice-President.
&quot;The convention has nominated a candidate, but not a President,&quot; he
said to Stewart L. Woodford. &quot;Since the nomination I have heard from
an influential friend at Albany, who declares that Garfield cannot
carry New York. Now, the question is, whom shall we place upon the
altar as a vicarious sacrifice? Mr. Morton has declined. Perhaps you
would like the nomination for Vice-President?&quot; Being assured that
Woodford would accept it if tendered to him, Conkling added: &quot;I hope
no sincere friend of mine will accept it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>In the event of Grant's nomination Levi P. Morton had been prominently
mentioned as a proper candidate for Vice-President. He was then
fifty-six years of age, and had achieved high reputation in banking
and financial circles. Though not eloquent according to the canons of
oratory, he spoke with clearness, was widely intelligent, and had
given careful attention to public questions. Conservative in his
nature and sturdy in his principles, he always advised against
rashness and counselled firmness. A single session in Congress had
proven his zeal in the performance of public duty, and his fitness for
Vice-President was recognised then as it was eight years later when he
became the running mate of Benjamin Harrison. Upon his nomination,
therefore, Garfield, before the convention had recessed, sent word by
Dennison that he desired Morton nominated for second place. Morton,
answering that his nomination must not be made without previous
consultation with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.444" id="Page_iii.444">iii. 444</a></span> associates, immediately informed Conkling of
Garfield's desire. Conkling replied, &quot;If you think the ticket will be
elected; if you think you will be happy in the association, accept.&quot;
To this Morton answered, &quot;I have more confidence in your judgment than
in my own.&quot; Conkling then added: &quot;Governor Boutwell of Massachusetts
is a great friend of yours. Why don't you talk with him?&quot; Acting upon
this suggestion Morton sought Boutwell, who advised against it. Morton
acquiesced and refused the use of his name.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p>After returning to their headquarters at the hotel the Stalwarts, upon
the suggestion and insistence of George H. Sharpe, quickly agreed upon
Chester A. Arthur, who gave an affirmative response to their appeal.
Conkling was not present at the time, but subsequently in Arthur's
room, where Howard Carroll and several other delegates lingered, he
bitterly opposed placing a Stalwart upon the ticket and expressed in
unmeasured terms his disapprobation of Arthur's acceptance.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> On
their way to the convention Sharpe told Woodford of the pungent
flavour of Conkling's invective, and of Arthur's calm assertion of the
propriety of his action. At the wigwam Conkling refused Sharpe's
request to place Arthur in nomination.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>Upon the reassembling of the convention California presented Elihu B.
Washburne for Vice-President, a nomination which Dennis McCarthy of
New York, amidst cordial and hearty applause from the galleries,
seconded in a forceful speech. This indicated that Arthur was <i>persona
non grata</i> to the anti-Grant delegates of the Empire State. Jewell of
Connecticut, Ferry of Michigan, Settle of North Carolina, and Maynard
of Tennessee, were likewise presented. As the call of States proceeded
New York made no response in its turn, but when Woodford subsequently
proposed the name of Arthur, Dennison responded with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.445" id="Page_iii.445">iii. 445</a></span> spirited
second, followed by delegates from New Jersey, Illinois, Mississippi,
Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. This array of backing
brought McCarthy to his feet, who withdrew his second to Washburne and
moved that Arthur's nomination, under a suspension of the rules, be
made by acclamation. This required a two-thirds vote and was lost.
Then Campbell of West Virginia, amidst the loudest cheers of the
evening, seconded the nomination of Washburne. &quot;Let us not do a rash
thing.&quot; he said. &quot;The convention has passed a resolution favouring
civil service reform. Let us not stultify ourselves before the
country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a></p>

<p>At first Arthur's strength was confined to the Grant delegation,
twenty-five States showing an increase of only seventy votes, thirty
of which came from the South. But as the roll-call proceeded New York,
Ohio, and Pennsylvania brought other States into line, the ballot
giving Arthur 468, Washburne 193, and other favourite sons 90.</p>

<p>Arthur's nomination was a distinct disappointment. To many it was an
offence. Within the State leading Republican journals resented it by
silence, while others were conspicuously cold; without the State it
encountered even greater disadvantages, since his dismissal as
collector of customs had advertised him as the enemy of reform, the
apostle of bossism, and the friend of whatever was objectionable in
politics.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> Yet his friends found a creditable record. He had
successfully opposed the well-known action of Jonathan Lemmon, who
sought to recover eight slaves which he incautiously brought into New
York on his way from Virginia to Texas; he had established the right
of coloured people to ride in the street-cars; and he had rendered
valuable service in the early years of the war as engineer-in-chief
and quartermaster-general on the staff of Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.446" id="Page_iii.446">iii. 446</a></span> Morgan. He
possessed, too, an inherited instinct for keeping faith with men. In
his relations with politicians of high or low degree there was not a
trace of dissimulation or double-dealing. His career is a study of the
evolution of character. It is not strange, perhaps, that in the days
of custom-house investigations and bitter partisan strife, when he was
known as an henchman of Conkling, there was a lack of public
appreciation of the potentialities of a unique personality, but the
Arthur heritage included then as afterward absolute truthfulness,
shrewdness of judgment, high-minded patriotism, and consciousness of
moral obligation.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<h2>TILDEN, KELLY, AND DEFEAT</h2>

<h2>1880</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> defeat of Governor Robinson did not apparently change party
sentiment respecting Tilden's renomination for the Presidency. No
other candidate was seriously discussed. Indeed, the Democratic press
continued to treat it as a matter of course, coupling with it the
alleged subversion of an election, transcending in importance all
questions of administration, and involving the vital principle of
self-government through elections by the people. This new issue,
dwarfing all other policies, had been for three years the cornerstone
of every Democratic platform in state, county, or congressional
convention. No argument seemed to weaken it, no event could destroy
it. The Republican claim that the vote of three Southern States, as
declared at the polls, was the result of terrorism and did not in any
sense represent an honest expression of the popular will, made no
impression upon it. The well-known fact that Congress, because of the
confusion of the situation, had wisely sought a remedy in the
Electoral Commission, which was passed by Democratic rather than
Republican votes, in nowise weakened the force of its appeal. Not even
did the disclosure that Tilden's house had become the headquarter of
confidential agents, who sought to corrupt the electors, produce any
change in it. The one declaration, patiently and persistently kept
before the people, was that Tilden had been elected by the popular
vote and defrauded by a false count of the electoral vote, and that
the supreme issue in 1880 must be whether &quot;this shall be a government
by the sovereign people through elections, or a government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.448" id="Page_iii.448">iii. 448</a></span> by
discarded servants holding over by force and fraud.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> The
reiteration of this proposition made Tilden, it was claimed, the
necessary and inevitable candidate of the Cincinnati convention,
called to meet on June 22. The party seemed to believe, what Tilden
himself had announced from his doorstep three years before, that the
country would &quot;never condone fraud,&quot; and it did not propose to
sacrifice a winning issue.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, many New York Democrats disliked Tilden. Their number,
which the cipher disclosures materially increased, grew into
threatening proportions after Kelly's dissatisfaction had settled into
a relentless feud. This condition made Tilden's chances of carrying
the State uncertain if not absolutely nil, and encouraged his critics
to magnify his weaknesses until the belief generally obtained that
serious, perhaps fatal opposition would array itself at the State
convention on April 20. Statements as to Tilden's ill-health likewise
found currency. When not displaying evidence of unimpaired mental
vigour in the courtroom, he was said to be on the verge of total
paralysis.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> To his burdens the government also added another by
pursuing his income tax. This suit, commenced in January, 1877, and
destined to drag through five years until dismissed by the prosecution
without costs to either party, was fixed for the April term in 1880,
although the United States attorney admitted his unpreparedness for
trial.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> &quot;Thus was he persecuted with unrelenting virulence by the
Administration,&quot; says his biographer, &quot;and by the Republican press,
which neglected no opportunity of refreshing the memory of its readers
in regard to his imputed capacities for wickedness.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.449" id="Page_iii.449">iii. 449</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, to escape interruptions to which Gramercy Park exposed him,
Tilden settled in the summer of 1879 at Greystone on the Hudson, three
miles beyond the northernmost limit of the city, on the highest ground
south of the Highlands. Here he brought a portion of his library; here
he mingled with his flocks and herds; and here in the seclusion of a
noble estate, with the comforts of a palatial stone dwelling, he
discoursed with friends, who came from every part of the country to
assure him that he alone could keep the party together. Ever silent as
to his own intentions Tilden talked of the crime of 1876 until his
visitors, imbued with his own spirit, left him thoroughly impressed
with the importance of his renomination.</p>

<p>But Tilden did not trust the result to sentiment. Throughout New York
Daniel E. Manning and other lieutenants held a tight rein, and when
the Syracuse convention assembled an early roll-call, on a resolution
to determine the character of the Committee on Credentials, showed 295
votes for Tilden to 80 against him. If this overwhelming majority
shocked the dissenters, it was not less a surprise to the regulars. In
the convention of 1876 Tilden mustered, including Tammany, only 201
out of 375; now, after his enemies had exhausted their opposition, he
proved stronger than in the closing months of his famous career as a
reform governor. The result of this vote settled all controversies,
leaving the convention free to appoint electors and to select
delegates to Cincinnati.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> It was not to adjourn, however, until it
had shown a serene and polite contempt for John Kelly. During the
morning John B. Haskin, on behalf of the Tammany convention, had
presented a resolution expressing a desire for the union of the party
and asking the appointment of a harmony committee. Ignoring the
assembly from which he came, the convention treated the resolution as
a personal communication from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.450" id="Page_iii.450">iii. 450</a></span> Haskin, whom it assured, after politely
reciprocating his desire for the union of the Democratic party, &quot;that
the deliberative wisdom of the national convention will result in such
action as will secure the triumph of the Democratic party in the
ensuing election.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> This bitter rebuff, coupled with the
overwhelming majority for Tilden, indicated a conscious strength which
deeply impressed the party in other States, and greatly aided in
demoralising opposition in New York.</p>

<p>Nor did the convention adjourn until its Committee on Resolutions
sprung a further surprise. The delegates anticipated and applauded an
elaborate statement of the fraud issue, but the presentation of Tilden
as a candidate for President came with the suddenness of his
unexpected majority. Manning did not intend to go so far. His courage
came with his strength. Proof of this, if any were needed, existed in
the fact that the endorsement was in manuscript, while the rest of the
platform was read from a printed slip. To define the situation more
clearly the committee submitted a unit rule, declaring &quot;that in case
any attempt is made to dismember or divide the delegation by
contesting the seats of a portion of the delegates, or if delegates
countenance such an attempt by assuming to act separately from the
majority, or fail to co&#246;perate with such majority, the seats of such
delegates shall be deemed to be vacated.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Never did convention
adopt a more drastic rule. The reading of these ball and chain
provisions provoked hisses and widened the chasm between Tilden's
convention and John Kelly's side-show.</p>

<p>Kelly's bolt in 1879 had proved his power to destroy; yet to his
friends, if not to himself, it must have been deeply humiliating to
see the fierce light of public interest turned entirely on Tilden.
Kelly also realised the more poignant fact that jealousy, distrust,
and accumulated resentment lined the way he had marked out for
himself. Nevertheless, he walked on apparently heedless of the signs
of conflict. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.451" id="Page_iii.451">iii. 451</a></span> the regular Democratic convention would not admit
him, he threateningly assembled one of his own in Shakespeare Hall, to
be used, if the party did not yield, in knocking at the door of the
Cincinnati convention. William Dorsheimer acted as its temporary
chairman. Dorsheimer had become a political changeling. Within a
decade he had been a Republican, a Liberal, and a Democrat, and it was
whispered that he was already tired of being a Kellyite. His appeal
for Horatio Seymour indicated his restlessness. The feuds of Tilden
and Church and Kernan and Kelly and Robinson had left Seymour the one
Democrat who received universal homage from his party, and it became
the fashion of Tilden's enemies to refer to the Oneidan as the only
one who could unite the party and carry the State. It did not matter
to Dorsheimer that Seymour, having retired from active politics in
1868, was placidly meditating at Deerfield, devoted to agricultural
and historical interests. Nor did his clamour cease after the bucolic
statesman had declared that if he must choose between a funeral and a
nomination he would take the first,<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> since the mention of
Seymour's name always waked an audience into cheers. Later in the day
Amasa J. Parker, on taking the chair as president, artfully made use
of the same ruse to arouse interest.</p>

<p>It was not an enthusiastic convention. Many delegates had lost heart.
Kelly himself left the train unnoticed, and to some the blue badges,
exploiting the purpose of their presence, indicated a fool's errand.
In the previous September they had refused to support Robinson, and
having defeated him they now returned to the same hall to threaten
Tilden with similar treatment. This was their only mission.
Humiliation did not possess them, however, until John B. Haskin
reported that the regulars refused to recognise their existence. Then
John Kelly threw off his muzzle, and with the Celtic-English of a
Tammany brave exhibited a violent and revolutionary spirit. &quot;Tilden
was elected by the votes of the people,&quot; said Kelly, &quot;and he had not
suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.452" id="Page_iii.452">iii. 452</a></span>cient courage after he was elected to go forward, as a brave man
should have gone forward, and said to the people of the country, 'I
have been elected by the votes of the people, and you see to it that I
am inaugurated.' Nothing of the like did Mr. Tilden.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>In other words, Kelly thought Tilden an unfit candidate because he did
not decide for himself that he had been elected and proceed to take
his seat at the cost of a tremendous civil convulsion. Perhaps it was
this policy more than Kelly's personality which had begun to alienate
Dorsheimer. One who had been brought up in the bosom of culture and
conservatism could have little confidence in such a man. The platform,
though bitter, avoided this revolutionary sentiment. It protested
against the total surrender of the party to one man, who has &quot;cunning&quot;
and &quot;unknown resources of wealth,&quot; and who &quot;attempts to forestall
public opinion, to preoccupy the situation, to overrule the majority,
and to force himself upon the party to its ruin.&quot; It declared that
&quot;Tildenism is personalism, which is false to Democracy and dangerous
to the Republic,&quot; and it pronounced &quot;Tilden unfit for President&quot;
because &quot;his political career has been marked with selfishness,
treachery, and dishonour, and his name irretrievably connected with
the scandals brought to light by the cipher despatches.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Haskin
proposed a more compact statement, declaring that &quot;the Democratic
party does not want any such money-grabber, railroad wrecker, and
paralytic hypocrite at the helm of State.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p>After the two conventions adjourned the question of chiefest interest
was, would Tilden seek the nomination at Cincinnati? The action of the
convention demonstrated that the regular party organisation was
unaffected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.453" id="Page_iii.453">iii. 453</a></span> Kelly bolt, that Tilden controlled the party in the
State, and that his nomination was a part of the programme. Moreover,
it showed that the New York Democracy did not intend asking support
upon any principle other than the issue of fraud. But intimations of
Tilden's purpose to decline a nomination found expression in the
speech and acts of men presumedly informed. Lester B. Faulkner's
statement, in calling the convention to order, that he did not know
whether the Governor would accept a renomination, coupled with the
convention's reply to Haskin, expressing confidence that the action at
Cincinnati would result in the Democracy's carrying New York, had made
a deep impression. To many these insinuations indicated that because
of his health or for some unknown cause he was not seriously a
candidate. Others found reason for similar belief in the indisposition
of prominent delegates to resent such a suggestion. One veteran
journalist, skilled in reading the words and actions of political
leaders, asserted with confidence that he would not be a candidate. To
him Tilden's name concealed a strategic movement, which, in the end,
would enable his friends to control the nomination for another.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p>Such interpretation found hosts of doubters. Without Tilden, it was
said, the fraud issue would lose its influence. Besides, if he
intended to withdraw, why did Kelly assemble his convention? Surely
some one, said they, would have given him an inkling in time to save
him from the contempt and humiliation to which he had subjected
himself. There was much force in this reasoning, and as the date of
the national convention approached the mystery deepened.</p>

<p>Tilden was not a paralytic, as Haskin proclaimed. He could not even be
called an invalid. His attention to vexatious litigation evidenced
unimpaired mental power, and his open life at Greystone proved that
his physical condition did not hide him from men. He undoubtedly
required regular rest and sleep. His nervous system did not resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.454" id="Page_iii.454">iii. 454</a></span>
excitement as readily as in the days of his battle with Tweed and the
Canal ring. It is possible, too, that early symptoms of a confirmed
disease had then appeared, and that prudence dictated hygienic
precautions. Once, in December, 1879, when contemplating the strain of
the campaign of 1876, he questioned his ability to go through another.
Again, in the early spring of 1880, after prolonged intellectual
effort, he remarked in rather a querulous tone, &quot;If I am no longer fit
to prepare a case for trial, I am not fit to be President of the
United States.&quot; Such casual remarks, usually made to a confidential
friend, seemed to limit his references to his health.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> He
doubtless felt disinclined, as have many stronger men, to meet the
strain that comes when in pursuit of high public office, but there is
no evidence that ill-health, if it really entered into his
calculations, was the determining factor of his action. Conditions in
the Republican party had changed in the Empire State since the
nomination of Garfield. Besides, the cipher disclosures had lost him
the independent vote which he received in 1876. This left only the
regulation party strength, minus the Kelly vote. In 1876 Tilden's
majority was 26,568, and in 1879 Kelly polled 77,566. If Kelly's bolt
in 1880, therefore, should carry one-half or only one-quarter of the
votes it did in 1879, Tilden must necessarily lose New York which
meant the loss of the election. These were conditions, not theories,
that confronted this hard-headed man of affairs, who, without
sentiment, never failed to understand the inexorable logic of facts.
Nevertheless, Tilden wanted the endorsement of a renomination. This
would open the way for a graceful retreat. Yet, to shield him from
possible defeat, he secretly gave Manning a letter, apparently
declining to run again, which could be used if needed.</p>

<p>On reaching Cincinnati Manning found that a multiplicity of candidates
made it difficult to determine Tilden's strength. The ranks of the
opposition, based on cipher dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.455" id="Page_iii.455">iii. 455</a></span>closures and Kelly's threats, rapidly
strengthened, and although many friends of other candidates thought it
less hazardous to nominate him than to repudiate him, ominous warnings
piled up like thunder clouds on a summer day. Meantime New York's
active canvass for Henry B. Payne of Ohio seemed to conflict with
Tilden's candidacy, while Tilden's remarks, spoken in moments of
physical discouragement, added to the impression that he did not seek
the nomination. But why did he not say so? Manning, supposing he was
the sole possessor of the letter and believing the time not yet ripe
for producing it, kept his own counsels. Tilden, however, had given a
duplicate to his brother Henry, who now announced through the press
that Tilden had forwarded a communication. This reached Cincinnati on
the eve of the convention.</p>

<p>It was long and characteristic. He recalled his services as a private
citizen in overthrowing the Tweed ring and purifying the judiciary,
and as governor of the State in breaking up the Canal ring, reducing
the taxes, and reforming the administration. He told the familiar
story of the &quot;count out&quot;; maintained that he could, if he pleased,
have bought &quot;proof of the fraud&quot; from the Southern returning boards;
and accused Congress of &quot;abdicating its duty&quot; in referring the count
to the Electoral Commission. Since 1876, he said, he had been &quot;denied
the immunities of private life without the powers conferred by public
station,&quot; but he had done all in his power to keep before the people
&quot;the supreme issue&quot; raised by the events of that year. Now, however,
he felt unequal to &quot;a new engagement which involves four years of
ceaseless toil. Such a work of renovation after many years of misrule,
such a reform of systems and policies, to which I would cheerfully
have sacrificed all that remained to me of health and life, is now, I
fear, beyond my strength.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>Tilden did not intend this to be a letter of withdrawal. With the hope
of stimulating loyalty he sought to impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.456" id="Page_iii.456">iii. 456</a></span> upon the delegates his
vicarious sacrifice and the need of holding to the fraud issue. This
was the interpretation quickly given it by his enemies. Kelly declared
it a direct bid for the nomination. But a majority of the New York
delegation regretfully accepted it as final. Nevertheless, many ardent
Tilden men, believing the letter had strengthened him, insisted upon
his nomination. The meeting of the delegation proved a stormy one.
Bold charges of infidelity to Tilden reacted against Payne, and to
escape controversy Manning indiscreetly asked if he might yield to the
pressure which his letter had stimulated. To this Tilden could make
but one reply: &quot;My action is irrevocable. No friend must cast a doubt
on my sincerity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p>There is something pathetic in this passing of Tilden, but there seems
no reason for surprise. Tilden was essentially an opportunist. He
attacked the Tweed ring after its exposure; he made war upon the Canal
ring after its record had become notorious; and he reduced the State
taxes after the war debt had been paid. Upon these reforms he rode
into power, and upon the cry of fraud he hoped to ride again to
success. He was much too acute not to know that the cipher disclosures
had robbed him of the r&#244;le of reformer, but he seems to have been
blind to the obvious fact that every one else was also aware of it.
Besides, he lacked boldness and was at times the victim of indecision.
He was singularly unfortunate, moreover, in failing to attract a
circle of admirers such as usually surround public men of great
prominence. Nevertheless, the opinion then obtained, and a quarter of
a century perhaps has not changed it, that had Manning, when he
reached the convention city, boldly and promptly demanded Tilden's
nomination it could have been secured. Whether, if tendered him, he
would have accepted it, &quot;no one,&quot; says Bigelow, &quot;is competent to
affirm or deny. He probably did not know himself.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, New York lost whatever prestige it had inherited through
him. Payne had the support of barely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.457" id="Page_iii.457">iii. 457</a></span> majority of the
delegation,<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania, who had relied
upon it, was angry, and the first roll-call showed that Winfield S.
Hancock and Thomas F. Bayard held the leading places.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> This
contrasted sharply with its early success. George Hoadley of Ohio,
Tilden's devoted friend, had been made temporary chairman; Kelly,
rising to address the convention, had felt most keenly the absence of
a friend in the chair; and a two-thirds majority excluded the
Shakespeare Hall delegation. Such influence, however, was at an end.
The delegation affected control when Rufus H. Peckham declared from
the platform that as Tilden had renounced all claims New York would
support Randall; but the convention failed to join in the excited
cheers of the Philadelphians, while the roll-call soon disclosed
Hancock as the favourite. Before the result was announced officially
Wisconsin asked permission to change its twenty votes to the soldier,
and in the twinkling of an eye the stampede began. At the conclusion
of the changes Hancock had received all the votes cast save 33.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
William H. English of Indiana, a rich man, who had served four terms
in Congress during the administrations of Presidents Pierce and
Buchanan, was nominated for Vice-President. The platform favoured a
tariff for revenue only, exploited the election fraud, demanded honest
money of coin or paper convertible into coin, and stoutly opposed
Chinese immigration.</p>

<p>After Hancock's nomination Kelly's inning began. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.458" id="Page_iii.458">iii. 458</a></span> convention had
treated him coldly. On the first day, when New York was called,
desiring to protest against seating a member of the regular
delegation, he sought recognition from a seat among the alternates,
but Hoadley, without the slightest sign of seeing or hearing him,
ordered the roll-call to proceed. The overwhelming rejection of his
delegation was not less crushing. The vote combined a compliment to
Tilden and an official utterance against the action of his great
enemy, and as the States, answering promptly and sharply, dealt death
to bolting and paralysis to Tammany it became evident to the blindest
that Tilden possessed the confidence of his party. In spite of the
friendly relations between Hendricks and Kelly, Indiana voted a solid
No. Nine other States, including Kentucky, Louisiana, and North
Carolina, did likewise. Indeed, nearly two-thirds of the Southern
delegates ranged themselves against the Boss. To add to the public
proof of Kelly's weakness New York asked to be excused from
voting.<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kelly had his friends. They were not as strong in
numbers or in voice as those who cheered Conkling at Chicago, but in
the absence of a master-mind the galleries seized upon the Tammany
leader and cheered whenever he appeared. To give greater spectacular
effect to his first greeting, Wade Hampton of South Carolina got upon
his crutches and stumped down the aisle to shake him solemnly by the
hand. Kelly, however, did not reach the culminating point of his
picturesque r&#244;le until Hancock's nomination. After Randall, Hampton,
and others had spoken, cries for Kelly brought to the platform a
delegation of Tammany leaders walking arm in arm, with John Kelly,
Augustus Schell, Amasa J. Parker, and George C. Green in front. The
convention, save the New York delegation, leaped to its feet, and when
Kelly declared that hereafter whoever alluded to the differences which
had heretofore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.459" id="Page_iii.459">iii. 459</a></span> existed in the New York Democracy should be considered
a &quot;traitor to his party,&quot; the great enthusiasm forced cheers from
one-half of the New York delegation. To make the love-feast complete,
John R. Fellows, finally responding to impatient calls from all parts
of the hall, also took the platform.</p>

<p>Fellows, still in his forties, had had a varied, perhaps a brilliant
career. Born in Troy he found his way in early boyhood to Arkansas,
joined the Confederate army, fought at Shiloh, escaped from Vicksburg,
surrendered at Port Hudson, and remained a prisoner of war until June,
1865. Returning to Arkansas he served in the State Senate, and in 1868
came to New York, where he secured an appointment in the office of the
District Attorney. Public attention became instantly fixed on the
attractive figure of the intrepid young assistant. He leaped into
renown. He soon became the principal Democratic speaker in the city,
and from the first followed the fortunes of the pale, eager form of
the distinguished reform Governor. At Cincinnati he represented the
conservative Tilden men, and although upon reaching the platform he
faced a man of greater force, he betrayed no docile character, ready
to receive passively whatever the Boss might allot. His speech was
cleverly framed. He expressed no desire that Tilden Democrats be
forgiven for the political sins which their opponents had committed;
neither did he mar the good feeling of the occasion. But when, at the
conclusion of his remarks, John Kelly stepped forward, seized his
hand, and began working it up and down like a handle, Fellows stood
stiffly and passionlessly as a pump, neither rejecting nor accepting
the olive branches thrust upon him. Thus ended the great scene of the
reconciliation of the New York Democracy.</p>

<p>When plucked the fruit of this reunion was found not to be very
toothsome. Returning to New York, Tammany held a ratification meeting
(July 1) in which the regulars would not unite. Subsequently the
regulars held a meeting (July 28) at which Tilden presided, and which
Tammany did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.460" id="Page_iii.460">iii. 460</a></span> attend. Similar discord manifested itself respecting
the choice of a chief judge for the Court of Appeals. The Republican
State Committee had chosen Charles J. Folger, but when the regulars
advocated the same method of selection Kelly defiantly issued a call
(August 14) for a State convention. Such bossism, the product of a
strange, fitful career, was only less dramatic than that of Tweed. At
a subsequent conference Kelly submitted a letter stating that if a
convention were regularly summoned and Tammany given its full share of
delegates and committeemen, his call would be withdrawn.<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> To this
the regulars finally yielded, and a State convention, held at Saratoga
on September 28, made Kelly its head and front. His advent evoked the
loudest cheers, his demand for five members of the State committee met
little resistance, and Dorsheimer, besides serving as chairman of the
Committee on Resolutions, presented the name of Charles J. Rapallo,
who became the nominee for chief judge of Appeals. Thus within a few
months Kelly had defeated Robinson for governor, prevented Tilden's
nomination for President, and imposed his will upon the regular
organisation.</p>

<p>In the selection of municipal candidates he was not less successful.
Irving Hall insisted upon naming the mayor, and for many weeks the
bickering and bargaining of conference committees resulted in nothing.
Finally, Kelly proposed that the regulars select several satisfactory
persons from whom he would choose. Among those submitted was the name
of William Russell Grace, a respected merchant, a native of Ireland, a
Roman Catholic in religion, and a man of large wealth, but without
official experience of any kind. This was better, it was said, than
official experience of the wrong kind. Irving Hall included his name
with considerable reluctance. It distrusted his loyalty, since a
rumour, too well founded not to cause alarm, revealed Kelly's interest
in him. But Kelly's cunning equalled his audacity. He had secured the
nomination of Rapallo by voting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.461" id="Page_iii.461">iii. 461</a></span> William C. Ruger of Onondaga, and
he now caused it to be understood that under no circumstances would
Grace be acceptable. The merchant's name once upon the list, however,
the Boss snapped it up with avidity, while the Germans muttered
because three of the five city candidates were Irishmen. Thus the
campaign opened badly for the Democrats.</p>

<p>Nor did it open more auspiciously for the Republicans. Garfield's part
in the Cr&#233;dit Mobilier scandal was reviewed without regard to the
vindicatory evidence, while Nast's incriminating cartoon of 1873<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>
emphasised the failure of the great artist to introduce the Republican
candidate into his campaign pictures of 1880. It advertised the fact
that Nast retained his early opinion of the nominee's conduct. Further
to alienate the independent vote it was charged that Garfield, during
the visit of Grant and Conkling at Mentor (September 28), had
surrendered to the Stalwarts. Appearances did not discourage such a
belief. Conkling's hostility disclosed at Chicago was emphasised by
his withdrawal from New York City on the day that Garfield entered it
(August 5). Subsequently, in his initial speech of the campaign
(September 17), Conkling's first important words were a sneer at Hayes
and an implied threat at Garfield.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> Yet two weeks later the
Senator, while on a speaking tour through Ohio and Indiana, went out
of his way, riding three-fourths of a mile through a heavy rain, to
call upon Garfield. This looked as if somebody had surrendered. As a
matter of fact Conkling did not meet Garfield in private, nor did they
discuss any political topic,<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.462" id="Page_iii.462">iii. 462</a></span> but the apparent sudden collapse of
Conkling's dislike supplied Garfield's opponents with abundance of
powder. Meantime the loss of the September election in Maine crushed
Republican hope. A victory had been confidently expected, and the
failure to secure it, although the adverse majority was less than two
hundred, sent a chill to every Republican heart.</p>

<p>Spurred to greater effort by this blighting disappointment, the
Republicans regained courage by a spirited presentation of the
industrial question, which was strongly reinforced by returning
activity in trade and commerce. To offset its effect and to win the
industrial masses to Democratic support, lithographic copies of the
so-called &quot;Morey letter,&quot; approving Chinese immigration, which
purported to be written by Garfield, were spread broadcast (October
20) over the country. Garfield promptly branded it a forgery. Though
the handwriting and especially the signature resembled his,
accumulating evidence and the failure to produce the man to whom the
letter purported to be addressed, rapidly made clear its fictitious
character. Nevertheless, many Democratic journals and orators, notably
Abraham S. Hewitt, assuming its genuineness, used it with tremendous
force as favouring Chinese competition with home labour.</p>

<p>To add to the slanderous character of the closing days of the campaign
John Kelly, through the New York <i>Express</i>, rained fierce personal
assaults upon the distinguished editor of the New York <i>Herald</i>, who
opposed Grace. In bitterness the mayoralty fight surpassed the
presidential contest. Hints of a division of public money for
sectarian purposes had deeply stirred the city and given prominence to
William Dowd, the Republican candidate, whose interest in the common
schools characterised his public activities. Dowd had the support of
many members of Irving Hall, who, as they gnashed their teeth in
resentment of Kelly's cunning, became unweariedly active in combining
the strange and various elements of opposition. Not Daniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.463" id="Page_iii.463">iii. 463</a></span> himself
was more uncomfortably encompassed than Grace.</p>

<p>The October elections in Ohio and Indiana plainly indicated the trend
of public opinion, and on November 3 the Republicans carried New York
and the country.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> The significant point in the State returns,
however, was the severe punishment administered to Kelly. Whomsoever
he supported suffered humiliation. Hancock received 21,000 votes less
than Garfield, Rapallo 55,000 less than Folger, and Grace 38,000 less
than Hancock. In the presence of such a showing the Brooklyn <i>Eagle</i>,
a Democratic journal friendly to Tilden, thus philosophised: &quot;Bosses
and thorough organisation are incompatible. The success of
organisation depends upon reason. The success of the boss is due to
underhand arts. No young man can hope for the favour of a boss who
does not begin by cultivating the temper of a lick-spittle.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<h2>CONKLING DOWN AND OUT</h2>

<h2>1881</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">In</span> the speakership contest of January, 1881, the anti-Conkling leaders
discovered a disposition to profit by the election of Garfield. They
wanted to learn their voting strength, and to encourage assemblymen to
oppose George H. Sharpe, the Stalwart candidate, the <i>Tribune</i>, in
double-leaded type, announced, apparently with authority, that the
President-elect would not allow them to suffer.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> This sounded a
trifle warlike. It also quickly enhanced the stress between the
opposing factions, for those who are themselves not averse to
wire-pulling are morbidly suspicious of intrigue in others.</p>

<p>But nothing came of the <i>Tribune's</i> announcement. Sharpe's creditable
service on Grant's staff, his cleverness as a Stalwart manager, and
his acceptability as a speaker of the preceding Assembly, brought him
troops of friends. Although making no pretensions to the gift of
oratory, he possessed qualities needed for oratorical success. He was
forceful, remarkably clear, with impressive manners and a winning
voice. As a campaign speaker few persons in the State excelled him.
Men, too, generally found him easy of approach and ready to listen. At
all events his tactful management won a majority of the Republican
assemblymen before the opposition got a candidate into the field.
Under these circumstances members did not fancy staking good committee
appointments against the uncertainty of Presidential favours, and in
the end Sharpe's election followed without dissent.</p>

<p>In the election of a United States senator to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.465" id="Page_iii.465">iii. 465</a></span> Francis Kernan
on March 4, the Stalwarts did not find such smooth sailing. For
several years, ever since the gubernatorial nomination in 1876,
jealousy, accumulated resentment, and inevitable distrust had divided
them, but not until Thomas C. Platt of Owego and Richard Crowley of
Niagara announced their candidacy did the smouldering bitterness burst
into a blaze. Cornell and his friends promptly declared for Platt,
while Arthur, Sharpe, Thomas Murphy, and John F. Smyth, known as ultra
Conkling men, wheeled into line for Crowley. Conkling held aloof. He
probably preferred Levi P. Morton, although each candidate claimed to
be his preference. In the end Morton's name was tangled up in the
controversy, but he did not really get into it. Besides, a place in
the Cabinet seemed open to him.</p>

<p>At this time Cornell was at the height of his power. Prior to his
inauguration he had not stood for much in the way of statesmanship. He
was known principally as the maker and chauffeur of Conkling's
machine, which he subsequently turned over to Arthur, who came later
into the Conkling connection from the Morgan wing. Moreover, the
manner of his election, the loss of many thousand Republican votes,
and his reappointment of Smyth seriously discredited him. But friend
and foe admitted that he had shown real ability as governor. He had
about him no angles and no surprises. He exercised authority
cautiously, marshalled facts with skill, and presented clear and
enlightened reasons for his action. He seemed to be above rather than
below the level of his party, and his official colleagues, working in
harmony with his policies, found him honourable, if sometimes stubborn
and aggressive.</p>

<p>But in his relations to men as well as to policies he had betrayed a
disposition to change position. He did not attend the Chicago
convention. Nor did Arthur's nomination, brought about largely by
Sharpe's activity, particularly please him. While he behaved with
decorum and perhaps with loyalty, it was evident that if he did not
raise the standard of revolt, he had chosen to fight for his hand.
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.466" id="Page_iii.466">iii. 466</a></span> became the more apparent as the senatorial contest progressed. A
grim darksomeness about the expression of his countenance showed that
he took a sullen satisfaction in humiliating those who had humiliated
him. It was deftly done, but in the result it left its impression.</p>

<p>Crowley, then in his forty-sixth year, was well equipped for the
Senate. As a forceful speaker he was an object of respect even by his
opponents. In whatever legislative body he appeared he ranked amongst
the foremost debaters, generally speaking with an enlightenment and a
moderation that did credit to his intellect and to the sweetness of
his nature. He had served four years in the State Senate, one term in
Congress, and eight years as United States attorney in the Northern
District, being justly distinguished as one of the able men of Western
New York. He was sadly handicapped, however, by the infirmity of his
backers. Sharpe excited the deepest resentment by withholding the
appointment of the Assembly committees;<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> and Smyth and Murphy
represented all that was undesirable in politics.</p>

<p>Cornell was fortunate in his candidate. Platt's cool, quiet methods
had aroused little antipathy, while around him gathered loyalty and
gratitude. Very early in the contest, too, it began to be whispered
that if elected he might act independently of Conkling. To think of a
light-weight sparring up to a recognised champion tickled the
imagination of the Independents who numbered about forty, of whom
Chauncey M. Depew was the choice of a majority.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> Ira Davenport of
Steuben, a State senator of decided character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.467" id="Page_iii.467">iii. 467</a></span> strength, supported
his brother-in-law, Sherman S. Rogers of Erie, and others talked of
Vice-President Wheeler. George William Curtis argued that the aim of
the Independents should be to vote for the cause even if they voted
for different candidates, and thus show to the country and to Garfield
that a large and resolute opposition to the ruling organisation
existed in the party.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Depew's friends thought it wiser to &quot;split the
machine.&quot; It was a taking proposition. If the two senators, they
argued, differed upon questions of patronage, the one agreeing with
the President would undoubtedly prevail. Thus the Senator and the
Governor, backed by the patronage of the State and Federal
administrations, would control a machine of great possibilities.
Conkling appreciated the danger, and Warner Miller and William H.
Robertson approved the plan.</p>

<p>Miller was then in the prime of life. He combined the occupations of
manufacturer and farmer, evidenced marked capacity for business, and
gave substantial promise of growing leadership. From the schools of
Oswego he had entered Union College, and after teaching in Fort Edward
Collegiate Institute he became a soldier. Since 1874 he had been in
the Assembly and in Congress. He was fully six feet tall, well
proportioned, with a large head, a noticeably high forehead, a strong,
self-reliant, colourless face, and a resolute chin. A blond moustache
covered a firm mouth. He had the appearance of a man of reserve power,
and as a speaker, although without the gift of brilliantly phrased
sentences, he made a favourable impression. His easy, simple manner
added to the vigour and clearness of his words. Perhaps in the end he
fell short of realising the full measure of strength that his ardent
friends anticipated, for he possessed none of the characteristics of
the boss and seemed incapable of submitting to the daily drudgery that
political leadership demands. But for several years the reasonableness
of his opinions had an unmistakable influence upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.468" id="Page_iii.468">iii. 468</a></span> judgment of
men. Certainly, in 1881, his opinion greatly strengthened the Depew
scheme, and it soon became apparent that a sufficient number of
Independents could be relied upon to choose Platt. In the conference
that followed the latter promised to support the Garfield
administration. &quot;Does that statement cover appointments?&quot; asked
Woodin. Platt said it did. &quot;Even if Judge Robertson's name should be
sent in?&quot; insisted Woodin. Platt replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> That settled it,
and Platt's nomination occurred on the first ballot.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> Among the
earliest to send him congratulations was Senator Conkling.</p>

<p>After the campaign of 1880 Conkling seemed to dismiss the feeling
exhibited toward Garfield at Chicago, and in February (1881), at the
invitation of the President-elect, he visited Mentor. The Senator
asked the appointment of Levi P. Morton as secretary of the treasury,
and Garfield consented to give him the Navy, or select Thomas L. James
for postmaster-general. &quot;This conference was not wholly
satisfactory,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> but Conkling's position at the inauguration
ceremonies, voluntarily taken directly behind Garfield while the
latter read his inaugural address, indicated a real friendship. His
motion in the Senate that James be confirmed as postmaster-general
without the usual reference to a committee seemed to support this
belief, an impression subsequently stimulated by the prompt
confirmation of William M. Evarts for commissioner to the
International Monetary Conference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.469" id="Page_iii.469">iii. 469</a></span> Henry G. Pearson for postmaster of
New York, and Levi P. Morton for minister to France.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> Two weeks
later came a bunch of five Stalwarts.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> The next day (March 23)
Garfield nominated William H. Robertson for collector of customs at
New York and Edwin A. Merritt for consul-general to London. &quot;That
evens things up,&quot; said Dennis McCarthy, the well-known Half-breed of
the State Senate. &quot;This is a complete surprise,&quot; added Robertson. &quot;To
my knowledge no one has solicited for me any place under Garfield. It
comes entirely unsought.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> It was no less a surprise to the
Stalwarts. Not a hint of it had been dropped by the President. &quot;We had
been told only a few hours before,&quot; wrote Conkling, &quot;that no removals
in the New York offices were soon to be made or even considered, and
had been requested to withhold the papers and suggestions bearing on
the subject until we had notice from the President of his readiness to
receive them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> Indeed, the nomination came with such suddenness
that the action seemed to be hasty and ill considered.</p>

<p>There is much literature on the subject. Reminiscences of public men
during the last decade have opened a flood of memories, some of them
giving specific statements from the principal actors. Blaine assured
George S. Boutwell that he had no knowledge of Robertson's nomination
until it had been made, and Garfield told Marshall Jewell that Blaine,
hearing of the nomination, came in very pale and much astonished.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>
Garfield wrote (May 29, 1881) Thomas M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.470" id="Page_iii.470">iii. 470</a></span> Nichols, once his private
secretary, that &quot;the attempt to shift the fight to Blaine's shoulders
is as weak as it is unjust. The fact is, no member of the Cabinet
behaves with more careful respect for the rights of his brother men
than Blaine. It should be understood that the Administration is not
meddling in New York politics. It only defends itself when
assailed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> The President said to Conkling, declares Hoar, that he
desired to make one conspicuous appointment of a New York man who had
supported him against Grant, and that thereafter, upon consultation
with the two Senators, appointments should be made of fit men without
regard to factions. To this Conkling refused his consent, stoutly
objecting to Robertson's appointment to any important office in this
country. &quot;Conkling's behaviour in the interview,&quot; said President
Garfield &quot;was so insolent that it was difficult for him to control
himself and keep from ordering him out of his presence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> Conkling
says the President, on the Sunday preceding the appointment, informed
him &quot;that the collectorship of New York would be left for another
time.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> In a statement purporting to come from the President,
Jewell relates that when the five Stalwart nominations went to the
Senate, Garfield was immediately burdened with letters and despatches
in protest, coupled with the suggestion that everything had been
surrendered to Conkling, and that without delay or consultation he
sent in Robertson's name. &quot;It was only an instance,&quot; says Boutwell,
&quot;of General Garfield's impulsive and unreasoning submission to an
expression of public opinion, without waiting for evidence of the
nature and value of that opinion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the country at large accepted it as a Blaine
triumph. Senators, especially those who had served in the House with
the President and his Secretary of State, had no doubt of it. Such a
tremendously bold act was en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.471" id="Page_iii.471">iii. 471</a></span>tirely foreign to Garfield's character.
Nor could it have but one meaning. The man who had split the New York
delegation for Blaine was to have his reward and to occupy the place
of patronage and of power. More than that it was Blaine's long look
ahead. Such action required the highest order of political courage. It
opened an old quarrel, it invited opposition, it challenged to battle.
Men like Senator Frye of Maine, who had many times witnessed the
resolution and dominating fearlessness of Blaine, knew that it was his
act. &quot;For sixteen years,&quot; said Frye, &quot;the sting of Blaine's attack
kept Conkling unfriendly. Besides, he had no confidence in him.
Whenever reconciliation seemed imminent, it vanished like a
cloud-shadow. I could never unite them. Blaine was ready, but Conkling
would accept no advances. When Robertson's appointment came he knew as
well as I that it was the act of Blaine.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> Depew, with whom Blaine
had conferred, took the same view. On the day after the nomination was
sent in, Mrs. Blaine, rather exultingly and without any expression of
surprise, wrote her daughter of the incident. &quot;Your father has just
gone to the Department. Did you notice the nominations sent in
yesterday? They mean business and strength.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>Boutwell illustrates Conkling's lack of confidence in Blaine. After
the latter had become secretary of state he said to the Massachusetts
Senator that Conkling was the only man who had had three elections to
the Senate, and that he and his friends would be considered fairly in
the New York appointments. &quot;When in conversation with Conkling, I
mentioned Blaine's remark, he said, 'Do you believe one word of that?'
I said, 'Yes, I believe Mr. Blaine.' He said with emphasis, 'I don't.'
Subsequent events strengthened Mr. Conkling in his opinion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>The cordial relations apparently existing until then between the
President and the Senator encouraged the hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.472" id="Page_iii.472">iii. 472</a></span> that confirmation of
the nomination might not be opposed. Because of this feeling the New
York Legislature, by a formal resolution, endorsed it, and Republicans
generally spoke not unkindly of it. But Conkling, knowing that though
the voice was Garfield's, the hand was Blaine's, quickly precipitated
a contest in which the interest of the whole country centred. It
recalled the Arthur controversy, renewed the feverish energy of
Stalwart and Half-breed, and furnished glimpses of the dramatic
discord which stirred restlessly behind the curtains of Senate
secrecy. Under the rules of the Senate, Robertson's nomination went to
the Committee on Commerce, of which Conkling was chairman and in
control. Here the matter could be held in abeyance, at least until the
Stalwarts marshalled their influence to have it withdrawn. For this
purpose Vice-President Arthur and Postmaster-General James called at
the White House. Governor Cornell, through a personal friend, sent a
message to the President, declaring the nomination a great mistake and
urging its withdrawal.<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> Other distinguished men, including Senator
Allison of Iowa, visited the President on a similar mission. When
these overtures failed compromises were suggested, such as making
Robertson a Federal judge, a district attorney, a foreign minister, or
the solicitor general.</p>

<p>Meanwhile assuring messages and comforting letters from Blaine's New
York friends stimulated Garfield's courage. On March 27, four days
after the nomination, Whitelaw Reid, the accomplished editor of the
<i>Tribune</i>, telegraphed John Hay, in part, as follows: &quot;From
indications here and at Albany we have concluded that the Conkling
plan is: First, to make tremendous pressure on the President for
withdrawal of Robertson's name under threats from Conkling and
persuasion from James. Second, if this fail, then to make their
indignation useful by extorting from the President, as a means of
placating them, the surveyorship and naval office. With these two they
think they could largely neutralise Robertson. Cornell is believed
willing to acquiesce in Robertson, hoping to get other offices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.473" id="Page_iii.473">iii. 473</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;I wish to say to the President in my judgment this is the turning
point of his whole administration&#8212;the crisis of his fate. If he
surrenders now Conkling is president for the rest of the term and
Garfield becomes a laughing stock. On the other hand, he has only to
stand firm to succeed. With the unanimous action of the New York
Legislature, Conkling cannot make an effectual fight. That action came
solely from the belief that Garfield, unlike Hayes, meant to defend
his own administration. The Assembly is overwhelmingly Conkling, but
they did not dare go on the record against Robertson so long as they
thought the Administration meant business. Robertson should be held
firm. Boldness and tenacity now insure victory. The least wavering
would be fatal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p>When Hay read this message to Garfield, the latter said, &quot;They may
take him out of the Senate head first or feet first; I will never
withdraw him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> That the President might not weaken, Depew and
other Independents spent much time in Washington during the
controversy. &quot;The party standing of Blaine's New York supporters at
Chicago absolutely depended upon Robertson's confirmation,&quot; declared
Depew.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p>Conkling had not been idle. As usual he cast an anchor to the windward
by coquetting with Democratic senators and soothing his Republican
colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> He knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.474" id="Page_iii.474">iii. 474</a></span> control in caucus as well as in
committee, and on May 2, the Republican senators appointed a Committee
of Safety, which recommended that a majority decide the order of
executive business including &quot;uncontested nominations.&quot; These
nominations, it was explained, embraced such as were favourably
reported by a committee or accepted by the Republican senators of the
State from which the nominee hailed. In other words, the caucus action
practically notified the President that no nomination would be
confirmed that did not please a senator, if a Republican. To exclude
Robertson under such a rule it was only necessary that the New York
senators object to his confirmation. Immediately the press of the
country teemed with protests. The Constitution, it declared, imposed a
moral obligation upon senators to confirm a nomination which was not
personally unfit or improper, or which did not imperil the public
interest, and it was puerile for a majority to agree in advance to
refuse to consider any nomination to which any member, for any reason
whatever, saw fit to object. Such a rule substantially transferred the
Executive power to one branch of Congress, making the President the
agent of the Senate. It was &quot;senatorial courtesy&quot; run mad.</p>

<p>As the days passed senators exhibited, under pressure from the country
as well as from the White House, a growing desire to have the matter
settled, and as a final effort in the interest of harmony the
Committee of Safety itself called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.475" id="Page_iii.475">iii. 475</a></span> upon the President, proposing that
he withdraw Robertson's name and have the others confirmed. To this
Garfield emphatically declined to accede. A few days later (May 5)
Vice-President Arthur and Senator Platt suggested that he withdraw all
the New York nominations. The President replied that he would
willingly withdraw all except Robertson's, and if the latter failed an
entire new slate could then be made up. This did not satisfy, but
within an hour after his visitors had departed, the President, to
prevent the confirmation of some while Robertson's was left tied up in
committee, put his suggestion into a message, withdrawing the names of
the five Stalwarts. This was another surprise, more alarming than the
first, since it showed the Administration's readiness to fight.</p>

<p>Meantime the Republican majority exhibited signs of disintegration.
The session was running into hot weather, Democrats had demonstrated
their power to prevent a reorganisation of the Senate, and discord in
Republican States threatened disaster. Until recently Conkling had
felt sure of victory. But now, appreciating the delicacy of the
situation, he opened the caucus (May 9) with an earnest, conciliatory
speech. He disclaimed desiring any conflict with the President,
against whom he made no accusations of bad faith; described the
impracticability of his sustaining any relations with Robertson, in
whose way, however, he would place no obstacle to any office other
than that of collector; discussed the danger to which a lack of
political harmony would expose the party in New York; and in almost
pathetic tones urged that the courtesy of the Senate be not withheld
from him in this hour of his extreme need.</p>

<p>It was plain that he had won the sympathy of his colleagues, but
succeeding caucuses, now held daily, lined his pathway with portents
and warnings. The iron-clad rule ceased to be operative; a resolution
to postpone action until the next session avoided defeat because
hastily withdrawn; and a compromise, the last to be suggested,
proposing confirmation on condition that Robertson then decline the
office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.476" id="Page_iii.476">iii. 476</a></span> met with no favour. It was plain that at last the stress had
reached a climax. Senators no longer exchanged their impressions, or
asked &quot;How long?&quot; or &quot;What next?&quot; In their opinion either Garfield or
Conkling must recede, and they had learned that the President would
not. Moreover, it was rumored, after the caucus of May 13, that
Conkling had talked harshly, with much of the temper of a spoiled
child. As senators separated on that eventful Friday they declared
without hesitation, though not without misgiving, that the last caucus
had been held and the last obstacle to Robertson's confirmation
removed.</p>

<p>The position of Platt had at last become intolerable. Mindful of the
promise to Depew and his friends he had tactfully and patiently sought
to avoid a contest by satisfactorily arranging matters between the
President and Conkling. Now the end of compromises had come and a vote
impended. At this critical if not desperate moment he suggested
resignation.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> The Legislature that chose him in January was still
in session, and the combined votes of the Stalwarts would be
sufficient to re-elect them. This would liberate him from a promise
and strengthen both with a legislative endorsement. It was neither an
intrepid nor an exalted proposition, but Conkling accepted it.
Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.477" id="Page_iii.477">iii. 477</a></span> his nature required a relief from its high-strung
irritability in some sort of violence, and resignation backed by the
assurance that he would soon be restored to office and to greater
power on the shoulders of the party offered the seductive form which
that violence could take.</p>

<p>Before the Senate reconvened on Monday (May 16) the resignation of
Conkling and Platt was in the hands of Governor Cornell. It came with
the suddenness of Robertson's nomination. Neither Vice-President
Arthur shared their intention, nor did Cornell suspect it. The first
intimation came in two brief notes, read by the clerk, informing the
Senate of their action. But the crash&#8212;the consternation, if any were
anticipated, did not appear.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> No doubt many senators sincerely
regretted the manner of Conkling's going, but that all were weary of
his restless predominance soon became an open secret.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> Nor did his
reasons appeal to any one except as regarded his own personality and
power, since the Senator's statement showed a deliberate, personal
choice, not based on a question of public policy.</p>

<p>Stripped of its rhetoric and historicity the letter of Conkling and
Platt presented but two causes of complaint, one that the President,
in withdrawing some of the New York nominations, tried to coerce the
Senate to vote for Robertson; second, that Robertson, in voting and
procuring others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.478" id="Page_iii.478">iii. 478</a></span> to vote against Grant at Chicago, was guilty of &quot;a
dishonest and dishonourable act.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> The poverty of these reasons
excited more surprise than the folly of their resignation.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> Every
one knew that in urging senators to say by their vote whether William
H. Robertson was a fit person to be collector, the President kept
strictly within his constitutional prerogative, and that in
withdrawing the earlier nominations he exercised his undoubted right
to determine the order in which he should ask the Senate's advice.
Moreover, if any doubt ever existed as to Robertson's right to
represent the sentiment of his district instead of the decree of the
State convention, the national convention had settled it in his
favour.</p>

<p>Conkling's friends are credited with having overborne his purpose,
expressed soon after the election of Garfield, to leave the Senate and
engage in the practice of his profession.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> But that such
intention did not influence his resignation was evidenced by the fact
that immediately afterward he bivouacked at Albany and sought a
re-election. With his faithful lieutenants he constantly conferred,
while the faithless ones, scarcely less conspicuous, who openly
refused their support, he stigmatised. From the first Cornell was an
object of distrust. He had wired Conkling advising Robertson's
confirmation, and the Senator crushed the telegram in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.479" id="Page_iii.479">iii. 479</a></span> his hand. This
put the Governor into the disloyal class.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> It added to Conkling's
irritation also that Cornell remained silent. The Governor's friends
expressed some surprise that the Senator did not suggest an interview.
It would have been much more surprising if he had, for it is doubtful
if Conkling ever suggested an interview in his life. On the other
hand, Cornell, unwilling to use the machinery of his great office to
force Conkling's return, did not care to approach the Senator. It was
not unknown, however, that he refused to become a candidate for United
States senator, and that, although ten or fifteen members continued to
vote for him, he steadily encouraged his Stalwart friends not to
desert Conkling.</p>

<p>Although the Legislature which elected Platt on January 18 was still
in session, the sentiment dominating it had radically changed. The
party was deeply stirred. The Senator's sudden resignation had added
to the indignation aroused by his opposition to the Administration,
and members had heard from their constituents. Besides, a once
powerful Senator was now a private citizen. At the outset Independents
and several Stalwarts refused to enter a caucus, and early in the
contest the Democrats, marshalled by Manning, refused to come to the
rescue. Thus, without organisation, Republicans began voting on May
31. Seven weeks and four days later (July 22), after fifty-six
ballots, their work was concluded. The first ballot marked the highest
score for Conkling and Platt, the former receiving 39 and the latter
29 out of 105 Republican votes.<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> This severe comment upon their
course plainly reflected the general sentiment of the party. It showed
especially the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.480" id="Page_iii.480">iii. 480</a></span> dissatisfaction existing toward Conkling. Yet a few
Stalwarts remained steadfast to the end. On the morning of July 1,
when Platt, to the surprise of his friends, suddenly withdrew, he had
28 votes. On July 22 Conkling had the same.</p>

<p>The act of the assassin of President Garfield on the morning of July 2
had a visible effect upon the proceedings at Albany.<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> Although
for a time conditions indicated that the distinguished sufferer might
recover, legislators evinced a great desire to conclude the
disagreeable work, and on July 5, sixty-six Republicans held a
conference. Up to this time Depew had been the favourite for the long
term, registering fifty-five votes on the fourteenth ballot (June 14),
but in the interest of harmony he now withdrew his name.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>This opened the way for Warner Miller, who received in caucus on the
fifth ballot sixty-two of the sixty-six votes cast for the long term.
By previous agreement a Stalwart was entitled to the short term, and
had Cornell allowed his Stalwart friends to enter the caucus he might
have had the nomination. But he would not oppose Conkling. Moreover,
the belief obtained that the Democrats and Stalwarts would yet unite
and adjourn the session without day, thus giving the Senator time to
elect other friends to a new Legislature, and the Governor would not
disturb this hallucina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.481" id="Page_iii.481">iii. 481</a></span>tion. With Cornell out of the way Elbridge G.
Lapham easily won the nomination on the second ballot. Lapham had been
the first to desert Conkling, who now exclaimed, not without the
bitter herb of truth: &quot;That man must not reap the reward of his
perfidy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>The caucus did not at once bring union, but on July 12 Miller's vote
reached seventy; on the 15th it registered seventy-four; and on the
16th, with the help of Speaker Sharpe, who had encouraged Conkling's
going to Albany, Miller was elected.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> Lapham's vote, however,
hung fire until July 22, when, during a brief and most exciting
conference in the Assembly Chamber, State Senator Halbert, the
Conkling Gibraltar, exclaimed with the suddenness of a squall at sea:
&quot;We must come together or the party is divided in the State. I am
willing to vote now.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Reason and good nature being thus
restored, each Republican present rose and voted his choice, Lapham
receiving sixty-one, Conkling twenty-eight. In the general rejoicing
State Senator Pitts, a leader of the Independents, no doubt voiced the
feeling of all at that moment: &quot;I am as happy as Mr. Halbert. This
nomination has been made good-naturedly. It is an augury of good
feeling in the future. New York proposes to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.482" id="Page_iii.482">iii. 482</a></span> by the Republican
administration. I hope we shall never hear more the words Stalwart,
Featherhead, Half-breed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> When the joint convention again
reassembled the fifty-sixth ballot gave Elbridge G. Lapham ninety-two,
and Clarkson N. Potter, the new Democratic nominee, forty-two.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<p>For Conkling it was worse than defeat. The humiliation of having gone
to Albany, of being deserted by friend after friend, of enduring the
taunts of an inhospitable press, and, finally, of having his place
taken by one, who, in his opinion, had proven most faithless, was like
the torture of an unquenchable fire. Lord Randolph Churchill, after
his historic resignation as chancellor of the exchequer, declared that
he would not live it over again for a million a year. It is likewise a
matter of history that Senator Conkling never ceased to deplore his
mistake.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<h2>CLEVELAND&#8217;S ENORMOUS MAJORITY</h2>

<h2>1881-2</h2>


<p><br /><span class="smcap">While</span> Conkling was being deposed, John Kelly, to whom responsibility
attached for Hancock's defeat, also suffered the penalty of selfish
leadership.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> Although his standard of official honesty had always
been as low as his standard of official responsibility, it never
aroused violent party opposition until his personal resentments
brought Democratic defeat. This classified him at once as a common
enemy. In vain did he protest as Tweed had done against being made a
&quot;scape-goat.&quot; His sentence was political death, and as a first step
toward its execution, Mayor Cooper refused to reappoint him
comptroller, an office which he had held for four years. Republican
aldermen joined in confirming his successor. Similar treatment,
accorded his office-holding associates, stripped him of patronage
except in the office of register.</p>

<p>Then his Democratic opponents proposed depriving him of control in
conventions, and having failed to reorganise him out of Tammany
(April, 1881), they founded the County Democracy. William C. Whitney,
corporation counsel, Hubert O. Thompson, the young commissioner of
public works, and other leaders of similar character, heading a
Committee of One Hundred, became its inspiration. Under the Tam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.484" id="Page_iii.484">iii. 484</a></span>many
system twenty-four men constituted the Committee on Organisation,
while a few persons at any Assembly primary might represent all the
votes of the district. The new organisation proposed to make its
Committee on Organisation consist of six hundred and seventy-eight
members and to place the control of all nominations in the hands of
the people. It was a catchy scheme and quickly became popular. To
carry it into effect a public enrolment was made of the Democratic
voters in each election district, who had an opportunity, by
registering their names, to join the Election District Committee. When
thus affiliated each one could vote for a member of the Committee on
Organisation and for delegates to nominating conventions. On October 7
(1881) Abram S. Hewitt, chairman of the Committee of One Hundred,
issued an address, declaring that the organisation had 26,500 enrolled
members, and had elected delegates to attend the State convention
which met at Albany on October 11.</p>

<p>Kelly did not attend the convention. On his way from the depot to the
hotel he found the air too chilly and the speech of people far from
complimentary. It was plain, also, that the crushing defeat of Hancock
had obliterated factional division in the up-State counties and that
Daniel E. Manning was in control. Nevertheless, Tammany's delegates,
without the slightest resemblance to penitents, claimed regularity.
The convention answered that the County Democracy appeared upon the
preliminary roll. To make its rebuff more emphatic Rufus W. Peckham,
in presenting the report on contested seats, briefly stated that the
committee, by a unanimous vote, found &quot;the gentlemen now occupying
seats entitled to them by virtue of their regularity.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Kelly's
conceit did not blind his penetration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.485" id="Page_iii.485">iii. 485</a></span> to the fact that for the
present, at least, he had reached his end.</p>

<p>The Republican convention (October 5) proved not less harmonious.
Arthur had become President (September 19),<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> Conkling did not
appear, and Warner Miller's surprising vote for temporary chairman
(298 to 190), sustaining the verdict of the Legislature in the
prolonged senatorial struggle, completely silenced the Stalwarts.
Conkling's name, presented as a contesting delegate from Oneida,
provoked no support, while Depew, whom the Senator a year earlier had
sneeringly referred to as a &quot;creature of no influence,&quot; became
permanent chairman without opposition. In the selection of State
candidates few organization men found favour.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> Finally, in their
overconfidence the Independents carelessly postponed a resolution
reorganising the party in New York City to an hour when their rural
support had left the convention, and the most important business
before it failed by five majority. &quot;Thus by sheer negligence,&quot; said
George William Curtis, &quot;the convention has left a formidable nucleus
for the reconstruction of the machine which had been
overthrown.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> The platform deplored the death of Garfield,
expressed confidence in President Arthur, praised Cornell's wisdom,
prudence, and economy, and insisted upon equal taxation of
corporations and individuals.</p>

<p>Although the deep silence that characterised the October contest in
Ohio pervaded the campaign in New York, Republicans believed that
President Arthur, by the moderation and dignity of his course, had
favourably impressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.486" id="Page_iii.486">iii. 486</a></span> public.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> His nomination of Postmaster
General James and the tender of the Treasury to Edwin D. Morgan
commanded universal approval. When Morgan declined, the nomination of
Charles J. Folger, suggested by Morgan, added to his prestige. In
fact, the most ardent champions of Garfield had taken little exception
to the acts of the new Administration, and although Arthur's
supporters had suffered defeat in convention, it was inferred that the
President and his friends sincerely desired the triumph of their
party. Moreover, the action of Tammany and the County Democracy in
nominating separate local tickets had stimulated Republican
confidence. It meant that Kelly, in his inevitable desire to defeat
his enemy, would trade, combine, and descend to other underhand
jobbery, which usually benefited the opposite party.</p>

<p>However, the harmony blandly predicted did not appear. James W. Husted
was overwhelmingly defeated, while his party, for the first time in
twelve years, lost both branches of the Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> This
amazing disclosure exhibited the bitter animosity of faction. In
Albany, Erie, Oneida, and Oswego counties, Stalwart and Independent
resolutely opposed each other, even to the point in some instances of
supporting the Democratic ticket.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the County Democracy was exultant. In spite of the
combined opposition of Tammany and Irving Hall, the Whitney
organisation carried the county by several thousand majority, securing
four of the seven senators, twelve of the twenty-four assemblymen, and
twelve of the twenty-two aldermen. This left Tammany absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.487" id="Page_iii.487">iii. 487</a></span>
without patronage. It was not unnatural that many of Kelly's
co-workers should doubt the possibility of longer working harmoniously
under his leadership, and the great secession of prominent men from
Tammany after the formation of the County Democracy created little
surprise. But that the movement should include the rank and file was
an astonishing revelation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kelly, gathering up his three senators and eight
assemblymen, carried the war to Albany. Strangely enough Republican
discord had given him the balance of power in each legislative body,
and until the Democrats acceded to his terms (February 2) the Assembly
remained without a speaker.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Two weeks later, upon the
announcement of the Assembly committees, Tammany, declaring its
agreement violated, joined the Republicans in modifying the rules of
the Senate so as to permit the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint its
committees and complete its organisation.</p>

<p>No one knowing Kelly expected him to act otherwise. Nor can it be
seriously doubted that he fully expected the Democracy, at the very
next opportunity, to make substantial concessions. At all events Kelly
presented with great confidence Tammany's claims to representation in
the State convention which assembled at Syracuse on September 22
(1882).<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> He knew it was a critical moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.488" id="Page_iii.488">iii. 488</a></span> for the Democracy. The
poverty of the Republican majority in the preceding election, and the
Administration's highhanded efforts to defeat Cornell for
renomination, seemed to put the State within the grasp of a united
party. Yet the Tilden leaders, although divided among themselves,
shrank from giving him power. This feeling was intensified by the
renewed activity of the old canal ring. The presence, too, of Stephen
T. Arnot of Chemung, who served as a member of the Kelly State
Committee in 1879, added to their hostility. Indeed, so pronounced was
the resentment that on the first day of the convention Tammany was
refused tickets of admission.</p>

<p>But behind Kelly stood the two leading candidates for governor.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>
In his canvass of the State Roswell P. Flower, hopeful of Kelly's
support, had created a strong sentiment favourable to Tammany's
admission, while Henry W. Slocum, mindful of Tammany's dislike, had
also done what he could to smooth its way. Under such pressure the
leaders, after recognising the County Democracy as the regular
organisation with thirty-eight votes, gave Tammany twenty-four and
Irving Hall ten.</p>

<p>Although this preliminary struggle did not clarify the gubernatorial
situation, it had the effect of materially weakening Flower. Of his
popularity no doubt existed. As an industrious young man in Watertown
he had been a general favourite, and in New York, whither he went in
early manhood to take charge of his sister's property, left by her
millionaire husband, he became the head of a prosperous banking house
and the friend of all classes. The liberality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.489" id="Page_iii.489">iii. 489</a></span> his charities
equalled the splendour of his social entertainments, while a few
months in Congress as the successor of Levi P. Morton and the
successful opponent of William W. Astor, had introduced him to the
voters of the metropolis. He was now forty-four years old, with ample
wealth, a wide acquaintance, and surrounded by scores of experienced
political diplomats.</p>

<p>But Manning distrusted Flower. Back of him were Arnot, DeWolf, and
other anti-Tilden leaders. He also deeply resented Flower's support of
Kelly. It gave the Boss a new lease of power and practically paralysed
all efforts to discipline him. Besides, it betrayed an indisposition
to seek advice of the organisation and an indifference to political
methods. He seemed to be the rich man in politics, relying for control
upon money rather than political wisdom. Nor did it improve Flower's
chances among the country delegates that one of the convention
speakers thought him guided by Jay Gould, in whose questionable deals
he had generously participated.</p>

<p>Slocum had likewise sinned. Manning thought well of the distinguished
soldier whom he promised one hundred votes, which he delivered. But
his support of Kelly had been distasteful to the County Democracy.
Besides, he was charged with voting, when in Congress, for the &quot;salary
grab,&quot; and one delegate, speaking on the floor of the convention,
declared that as a trustee of the Brooklyn Bridge, &quot;Slocum would be
held responsible for the colossal frauds connected with its
erection.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> It added to the chaos of the situation that Flower's
supporters resented Slocum's activity, while Slocum's friends excepted
to the County Democracy's use of Allan Campbell as a stalking horse.</p>

<p>Grover Cleveland's candidacy seemed not very important. He was not
wholly unknown throughout the State. Lawyers recognised him as a
prominent member of the profession, and politicians knew him as
sheriff of Erie County in the early seventies and as the recently
elected mayor of Buffalo. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.490" id="Page_iii.490">iii. 490</a></span> people outside the Lake city knew
nothing of his character for stubborn independence, uncompromising
honesty, and fearless devotion to duty. His friends tried to tell the
delegates that he insisted upon public officials treating the people's
money as its trustees, and that he had promptly vetoed every departure
from this rule. They claimed also that he could neither be coaxed nor
constrained into the approval of men or measures that were not honest
and proper, citing several illustrations that had greatly gratified
and aroused his home people. This was the gist of Daniel N. Lockwood's
short, happy, and forceful speech in presenting his name to the
convention.</p>

<p>But such recommendations of candidates were not unusual, and although
Erie and the surrounding counties mustered fifty or sixty votes, no
movement toward Cleveland existed other than that growing out of the
peculiar political situation. If Slocum and Flower failed, Nelson or
Corning might benefit. Edward Murphy of Rensselaer, then mayor of Troy
for the fourth term and closely associated with Manning in leadership,
represented Corning with spirit, while the Dutchess friends of Homer
A. Nelson exhibited their devotion by an energetic canvass. Yet
Cleveland possessed one strategic point stronger than either of them.
His absolute freedom from the political antagonisms of New York and
King counties commended him to the County Democracy. This organisation
of extraordinary leadership had tired of deals and quarrels. The
hammering of Tilden, the sacrifice of Robinson, the defeat of Hancock,
and the hold-up in the last Legislature made a new departure
necessary, and it may be said with truth and without injustice that
the night before the convention opened the nomination of Cleveland, if
it could be accomplished, seemed to the County Democracy the wisest
and safest result.</p>

<p>When the roll-call began Kelly, playing for position, divided
Tammany's vote among the possible winners, giving Flower seven, Slocum
six, Cleveland six, and Corning five. The County Democracy voted for
Campbell. Corning's with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.491" id="Page_iii.491">iii. 491</a></span>drawal and large secessions from Nelson and
Belmont sent Slocum and Flower far in the lead on the second ballot,
while Cleveland moved up five points with the help of Kelly and
others. The County Democracy again voted for Campbell. On the third
ballot a break was inevitable. Hutchins had remained stationary,
Nelson and Belmont were practically out of the race, and Slocum and
Flower stood even. It was now in the power of the County Democracy to
nominate Slocum. Manning approved it and Murphy had already given him
the Corning vote. But the County Democracy, inspired by men of
prescience and of iron nerve, went to Cleveland in a body, making the
hall resound with cheers. Had Tammany, the next delegation called,
followed suit, Kelly might have divided with his opponents the honour
of Cleveland's nomination. Instead, it practically voted as before.
But Albany, Rensselaer, and other counties, catching the tide at its
turn, threw the convention into a bedlam. Finally, when Kelly could
secure recognition, he changed Tammany's vote to Cleveland.</p>

<p>To the tally-clerks Cleveland's nomination by two majority was known
before the completion of the ballot. Yet upon the insistence of the
Slocum men, because of confusion in making changes, the convention
refused to receive the result and ordered another roll-call. This gave
Cleveland eighteen votes to spare.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>The result brought the Democrats into perfect accord for the first
time in many years. It had come without the exercise of illegitimate
influences or the incurrence of personal obligation. To no one in
particular did Cleveland owe his nomination. Besides, his success as a
politician, his character as a public official, and his enthusiastic
devo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.492" id="Page_iii.492">iii. 492</a></span>tion to the clients whose causes he championed, challenged the
most careful scrutiny. He was then unmarried, forty-four years old,
tall, stoutly-built, with a large head, dark brown hair, clear keen
eyes, and a generous and kindly nature concealed under a slightly
brusque manner. His sturdy old-fashioned rectitude, and the just
conviction that by taste and adaptability for public life he had
peculiar qualifications for the great office of governor, commended
him to popular confidence. In Buffalo, where he had lived for a
quarter of a century, people knew him as a man without guile.</p>

<p>Two days before Cleveland's nomination (September 20), the Republicans
had selected Charles J. Folger, then secretary of the treasury. In
character for honesty and ability the two men were not dissimilar, but
the manner of their selection was antipodal. Of the five candidates
who appealed to the convention, Cornell was the only real opponent of
the Secretary.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> For more than a year, ever since he took office,
in fact, Cornell had counted upon a renomination. He cleverly
strengthened the State machine, surrounded himself with able
lieutenants, and never failed to make appointments promotive of his
ambition. The confirmation of Isaac V. Baker as superintendent of
prisons with the aid of Tammany's three senators, especially
illustrated his skill in reaching men. But he had done more than
organise. His numerous vetoes called attention to his discriminating
work, indicating honesty, efficiency, activity in promoting the
people's interests, and fidelity to Republican principles. An honest
public sentiment recognised these good features of his work. Indeed,
his administration admittedly ranked with the best that had adorned
the State for a century, and his friends, including Independents and
many Stalwarts, rallied with energy to his support. It was known, too,
that the wisdom of Blaine permeated his councils.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.493" id="Page_iii.493">iii. 493</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Conkling and the President marked him for defeat. It was
notorious that their hostility grew out of the Governor's passivity in
the senatorial election, Arthur feeling the humiliation of that defeat
scarcely less than Conkling, while memories of Crowley's failure and
of the Governor's exultation had not faded. Conkling, not less bitter,
had more recent cause for resentment. As the attorney of Jay Gould he
had indicated a willingness to forgive and forget the past if the
Governor would approve legislation favourable to the Gould properties.
But Cornell, satisfied of its unfairness, courageously refused.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>
When he did so he knew and subsequently declared, that if he had
signed the bill, neither Gould nor Conkling would have opposed his
renomination.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>For these purely personal reasons an extraordinary situation was
created, revealing the methods of purse and patronage by which the
Gould-Conkling combine and the Administration got revenge. In their
efforts in Folger's behalf delegates were coerced, and efficient
officials at Albany, Brooklyn, Utica, and Ogdensburg, removed in the
middle of their terms, were replaced by partisans of the President.
Even after the patronage packed convention assembled the questionable
methods continued. Gould's agent hovered about Saratoga. To secure the
selection of a temporary chairman by the State committee, Stephen B.
French, an intimate of Arthur, presented a fraudulent proxy to
represent William H. Robertson.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> Had the convention known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.494" id="Page_iii.494">iii. 494</a></span> this
at the moment of voting swift defeat must have come to the
Administration, which barely escaped (251 to 243) by getting
postmasters into line.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>The candidacy of James W. Wadsworth, son of the famous general, and
recently state-comptroller, likewise became a decoy for Folger.
Wadsworth himself had no understanding with that wing. He was
absolutely independent and unpledged. But the Stalwarts, in districts
opposed to them, promoted the choice of such so-called Wadsworth
delegates as could be captured by the persuasive plea for harmony, and
under the stress of the second ballot, when Starin's and Robinson's
support broke to Cornell, some of them voted for Folger. This gave the
Administration's candidate eight more than the required number.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>The belated platform, fulsomely eulogistic of Cornell, added to the
indignation of the Independents, since it seemed a mockery to present
what the Stalwarts did not offer until after a nomination. It gave
still greater offence when the State Committee selected John F. Smyth
as its chairman to conduct the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.495" id="Page_iii.495">iii. 495</a></span></p>
<p>&quot;It is hardly worth while analysing the influences which have
contributed to this result,&quot; said the New York <i>Times</i>. &quot;The fact is
plain that the Gould-Conkling combination, backed by the power of the
Federal Administration, has accomplished what it set out to do.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>
Henry Ward Beecher in a Sunday evening sermon, said that &quot;When Cornell
went out, Avarice and Revenge kissed each other.&quot; Theodore L. Cuyler,
then pastor of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn,
declared that he &quot;stood by the cradle of the Republican party, but
when it shunted off on the wrong track I will not go over the
precipice with it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> In hastening to deny that <i>Harper's Weekly</i>
would support Folger, George William Curtis wrote: &quot;Judge Folger's
ability and character are not in question, but his nomination is. That
nomination was procured by the combined power of fraud and patronage,
and to support it would be to acquiesce in them as legitimate forces
in a convention.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> The Buffalo <i>Express</i>, a vigorous and
independent Republican journal, also bolted the ticket,<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> an
example followed by several other papers of similar character
throughout the State. After the lapse of a fortnight, Hepburn,
candidate for congressman-at-large, declined to accept because &quot;it is
quite apparent that a very large portion of the Republicans, owing to
the unfortunate circumstances which have come to light since the
adjournment of the convention, are not disposed to accept its
conclusion as an authoritative utterance of the party.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.496" id="Page_iii.496">iii. 496</a></span></p><p>Folger was not suspected of any personal complicity with unfair
dealing, but the deep and general Republican dissatisfaction greatly
disturbed him. His friends urged him to withdraw. Stewart L. Woodford,
then United States attorney, insisted that fraud and forgery vitiated
all the convention did, and that the &quot;short, direct, and honourable
way out of it was to refuse the nomination.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> The Kings County
executive committee assured him that many influential Republicans
considered this the wisest course. From prominent men in all parts of
the State came similar advice. This view appealed to his own better
judgment, and he had decided so to act until persuaded otherwise by
the pleadings of the Stalwarts.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> His acceptance, recalling the
Tilden letter of 1880, was a touching appeal to the voters. Referring
to the fraudulent practices, he said: &quot;No one claims, no one believes,
that I had lot or part therein, or previous hint or suspicion thereof.
I scorn an end to be got by such means. I will not undertake to
measure the truth of all these reports; that of one is beyond
dispute.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> Nevertheless, Folger could not deny that he was a
willing recipient of that &quot;one,&quot; through the influence of which, by
creating the impression that Robertson and other anti-Administration
leaders favoured the Stalwart's choice of a temporary chairman, he
gained a much greater power in the convention than his eight majority
represented.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>In accepting the Democratic nomination Cleveland had the great
advantage of not being obliged to refer to anything of which he was
ashamed. Its tone was simple, sober, and direct, and from the
principles expressed, the measures advocated, or the language
employed, the reader could form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.497" id="Page_iii.497">iii. 497</a></span> no idea to what party the writer
belonged. He desired primary elections to be &quot;uncontaminated and
fairly conducted&quot;; condemned the interference of &quot;officials of any
degree, State or Federal, for the purpose of thwarting or controlling
the popular wish&quot;; favoured tenure of office in the civil service
being dependent upon &quot;ability and merit&quot;; and denounced the levying of
political assessments, declaring &quot;the expenditure of money to
influence the action of the people at the polls or to secure
legislation is calculated to excite the gravest concern.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

<p>The campaign became historic because it revealed the most serious
disturbance in the Republican party since the war. Little was heard
save apology, indignant protest, and appeal to tradition. Whatever
Republican hope existed was based upon the unworthiness of the
Democratic party. In a letter to an Albany meeting Folger declared,
after highly praising his opponent, that &quot;There is one difference
which goes to the root of the matter when we are brought to view as
public men and put forward to act in public affairs. He is a Democrat.
I am a Republican.&quot; Then, becoming an alarmist, he referred to the
shrinkage in the value of stocks on the day after the Democratic
victory in Ohio. &quot;That shrinkage has been going on ever since,&quot; he
said. &quot;Do the business interests of the country dread a return of the
Democratic party to power? Will the election of Cleveland increase it?
These are questions for hesitating Republicans to ponder.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> This
Stock Exchange view of politics, redolent of the operations of brokers
in Wall Street, did not help the Republican candidate. Curtis thought
it, coming from the Secretary of the Treasury, &quot;most
extraordinary.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> Besides, the decline in the stock market began
before the Ohio election, when conditions indicated Republican
success.</p>

<p>The local campaign in the metropolis assumed more life. In spite of
its avowed purpose to rid the city of dishonest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.498" id="Page_iii.498">iii. 498</a></span> political tricksters,
the County Democracy made bedfellows of Tammany and Irving Hall, and
nominated Franklin Edson for mayor. This union was the more offensive
because in its accomplishment the Whitney organisation turned its back
upon Allan Campbell, its choice for governor, whom a Citizens'
Committee, with Republican support, afterwards selected for mayor.
Campbell as city-comptroller was familiar with municipal affairs, and
of the highest integrity, independence, and courage. His friends
naturally resented the indignity, and for ten days an effective
canvass deeply stirred New York.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Republican party was doomed. Managers beckoned hope
by frequent assertions, sometimes in the form of bulletins, that the
indignation was subsiding. Smyth and his State Committee disclaimed
any part in the wrong-doing by expressing, in the form of a
resolution, their &quot;detestation of the forged proxy, and of all the
methods and purposes to which such wretched fraud and treachery
apply.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> Even the nominee for lieutenant-governor argued that he
was an honest man. But the people had their own opinion, and a count
of the votes showed that Folger, in spite of his pure and very useful
life, had been sacrificed,<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> while Cleveland had a majority
greater than was ever known in a contested State election. It was so
astounding that Democrats themselves did not claim it, in the usual
sense, as a Democratic victory.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> Everybody recognised it as a
rebuke to Executive dictation and corrupt political methods. But no
one denied that Cleveland helped swell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii.499" id="Page_iii.499">iii. 499</a></span> the majority. He became known
as the &quot;Veto Mayor,&quot; and the history of his brief public life was
common knowledge. His professional career, unlike Tilden's, disclosed
no dark spots. He had been an honest lawyer as well as an upright
public official, and the people believed that his stubborn
independence and sturdy integrity would make him a real governor, the
enemy of rings and bosses, and the foe of avarice and revenge.</p>

<h2>A POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE<br />
STATE OF NEW YORK</h2>

<h3>(1774-1861)</h3>

<p>By D.S. ALEXANDER. Two volumes. 840 pp. 8vo. $5.00 net (carriage
extra).</p>

<p>This work presents a history of the movements of political parties in
New York State from 1774 to 1861, and embraces a series of brilliant
character studies of the leaders, most of them of national importance,
who, from the days of George Clinton, have drawn the attention of the
nation to New York. The astute methods and sources of power by which
George Clinton, Hamilton, Burr, DeWitt Clinton, Van Buren, Seymour and
Thurlow Weed each successively controlled the political destiny of the
State are clearly and picturesquely set forth.</p>

<p>&quot;It meets a want widely felt and repeatedly expressed during the past
hundred years.... It would be impossible in a dozen notices to render
any sort of justice to the extensive scope of this work and to the
multiplicity of its interesting details.&quot;&#8212;From two leading articles,
aggregating over ten columns, in the <i>New York Sun</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Will undoubtedly take its place as the authoritative work upon the
subject.&quot;&#8212;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Without question he has performed ... his task very capably. He
addresses the general reader and takes pains to be entertaining,
dealing with men in preference to measures&#8212;and only the most
conspicuous, the most interesting men.... Of these outstanding figures
there are full length portraits&#8212;biographies, indeed, in ample detail
strung on a long thread of politics, while very many minor characters
have thumb-nail sketches. Few of the good anecdotes available, it
would seem, have escaped Mr. Alexander, and good stories do not suffer
at his hands.&quot;&#8212;<i>The New York Globe.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Will not only repay careful reading, but should be placed among the
permanent reference books of every man who has occasion to know
anything about the politics of this state.... Estimates of the great
men ... are among its most interesting features.&quot;&#8212;<i>Buffalo Express.</i></p>

<p>&quot;The most entertaining story of state politics in American
history.&quot;&#8212;<i>Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Will be read with great interest and profit outside the Empire
State.&quot;&#8212;<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer.</i></p>

<h2>TWO BOOKS ON VITAL QUESTIONS<br />
FOR THOUGHTFUL AMERICANS</h2>

<hr style="width: 45%" />

<h3>THE NEGRO AND THE NATION</h3>

<h4>By GEORGE S. MERRIAM</h4>

<p>Probably the first complete history of the negro in his relation to
our politics, <i>2d printing</i> 436 pp. $1.75 net. By mail $1.92.</p>

<p>The Rev. <span class="smcap">Edward Everett Hale</span> in &quot;Lend a Hand&quot;: &quot;Sensible people who
wish to know, who wish to form good sound opinions, and especially
those who wish to take their honest part in the great duties of the
hour, will read the book, will study it, and will find nothing else
better worth reading and study.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Admirable, exactly the sort of book needed.... Enlightened and
persuasive discussion of the negro problem in its present phases and
aspects. Not a dry history. Human, dramatic, interesting, absorbing,
there is philosophy of national and political life back of it&#8212;a
philosophy which not only furnished interpretation of past events, but
offers guidance for the future.... Impartial and informing.... There
is much that tempts quotation.... Mr. Merriam has given us an
excellent, high-minded, illuminating book on the problem of the
American negro.&quot;&#8212;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>&quot;A deeply interesting story.... An exceedingly readable volume,
especially valuable in its analyses of conditions, causes, situations
and results; and against his main conclusions no sane person can
contend.&quot;&#8212;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>


<h3>STUDIES IN AMERICAN TRADE-UNIONISM</h3>

<h4>J.H. HOLLANDER and G.E. BARNETT (Editors)</h4>

<p>Twelve papers by graduate students and officers of Johns Hopkins
University, the results of original investigations of representative
Trade Unions. There are also chapters on Employers' Associations, the
Knights of Labor, and the American Federation of Labor. (380 pp., 8vo,
$2.75 net. By mail, $2.98.)</p>

<p>&quot;A study of trade-unions in the concrete. Impartial and thorough ...
expertly written.&quot;&#8212;<i>New York Times Review.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Though confined to particular features of particular trade unions,
the data dealt with are comprehensive and typical; so that the result
is a substantial contribution to our knowledge of trade-union
structure and functions.... Excellent studies.&quot;&#8212;<i>New York Evening
Post.</i></p>

<p>&quot;It is doubtful if anything approaching it in breadth and co&#246;rdination
has yet found its way into print.... A very useful book.&quot;&#8212;<i>San

<h2>AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY</h2>

<hr style="width: 45%" />

<h3>OUR PHILIPPINE PROBLEM</h3>

<h4>By Prof. HENRY PARKER WILLIS</h4>

<p>A study of American Colonial Policy. 12mo, $1.50 net (By mail, $1.64)</p>

<p>A book of vital interest, based on personal investigation in the
Philippines by a former editorial writer of the <i>New York Evening
Post</i>, who was also Washington correspondent of the <i>New York Journal
of Commerce</i> and <i>Springfield Republican</i>, and is now a professor in
Washington and Lee University.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyone desiring to inform himself fully as to the history, politics,
public questions, in short, everything dealing with the subject of
American control of the Philippines from the day Dewey entered Manila
harbor to the present, will find Mr. Willis's work a most important
book.... He writes of the Filipinos as he found them, and with the
knack of the true investigator, has avoided falling in with the
political views of any party or faction. More valuable still is his
exposition of the Philippine question in its bearings on American life

1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, the Lecompton constitution of
1858, nor the presidential election of 1860. It is plain that he has

this, and a free press, are the three elements which distinguish
liberty from despotism. All that Saxon blood has gained in the battles

Chairman, every one of them is annihilated in every square mile of the
republic. We live to-day, every one of us, under martial law. The
Secretary of State puts into his bastille, with a warrant as
irresponsible as that of Louis, any man whom he pleases. And you know
that neither press nor lips may venture to arraign the government
without being silenced. At this moment at least one thousand men are
'bastilled' by an authority as despotic as that of Louis, three times
as many as Eldon and George III seized when they trembled for his
throne. For the first time on this continent we have passports, which

save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would
not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery,
I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to
save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I
could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if
I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I
could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would do
that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I
believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear
because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do
less whenever I believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall
do more when I shall believe doing more will help the
cause.&quot;&#8212;<i>Lincoln's Works</i>, Vol. 2, p. 227.</p></div>

&quot;Greeley sent for me some weeks before the convention and pressed me
with such vigour to take a position upon the State ticket that I
finally consented. He then secured from practically the whole State an
endorsement of the suggestion on my behalf. On the morning of the
convention he suddenly decided that some one connected with the army
must be chosen and sent around an order for a change of programme just
before the roll was called. It was the most fortunate thing that could
have happened to me, but created widespread distrust of his qualities
as a leader.&quot;&#8212;Speech of Chauncey M. Depew, April 4, 1902. <i>Addresses

Hutchins when in Congress in 1879 told Joseph G. Cannon, now the
distinguished speaker of the House of Representatives, that in
September, 1864, during a call upon Greeley, the latter exhibited a
letter from Lincoln two days old, inviting him to the White House.
Greeley, mindful of his efforts to substitute another candidate for
Lincoln, said he would not reply and should not go, but Hutchins
finally gained consent to represent him. Hutchins reached Washington
very early the next morning, and the President, although clad only in
undershirt and trousers, received him and began enlarging upon the
importance of a re-election, suggesting that in such event Seward
would enjoy being minister to England, and that Greeley would make an
admirable successor to Benjamin Franklin, the first
postmaster-general. Hutchins reported this to Greeley, who immediately
turned the <i>Tribune</i> into a Lincoln organ. In the following April
Greeley recalled Lincoln's statement to Hutchins, who at once left for
the capital. He reached Washington the morning after the President's
assassination.</p></div>

impaired, and in the spring of 1866 he went to Europe. But a change of
climate brought no relief, and he died, on the return voyage, at the
age of fifty-six. That the people deeply mourned his loss is the
evidence of those, still living, to whom there was something dashing
and captivating even in his errors.</p></div>

Apropos of Raymond's fickleness Stevens remarked, when the former
appealed to his friends on the floor to furnish him a pair, that he
saw no reason for it, since he had observed that the gentleman from
New York found no difficulty in pairing with himself.&#8212;William M.
Stewart, <i>Reminiscences</i>, pp. 205-206.
</p><p>
At another time when an excited member declared that Stevens commands
us to &quot;go it blind,&quot; Hale of New York, with an innocent expression,
asked the meaning of the phrase. Instantly Stevens retorted: &quot;It means
following Raymond.&quot; The hit was doubly happy since Hale had followed
Raymond in his support of Johnson.&#8212;Boutwell, <i>Reminiscences</i>, Vol. 2,

hope he will not be too severe. The contempt of that large-minded
gentleman is so wilting, his haughty disdain, his grandiloquent swell,
his majestic, supereminent, overpowering, turkey-gobbler strut has
been so crushing to myself and all the members of this House, that I
know it was an act of the greatest temerity for me to venture upon a
controversy with him.&quot; Referring to a comparison which had been made
of Conkling to Henry Winter Davis, Blaine continued: &quot;The gentleman
took it seriously, and it has given his strut additional pomposity.
The resemblance is great; it is striking. Hyperion to a Satyr,
Thersites to Hercules, mud to marble, dunghill to diamond, a singed
cat to a Bengal tiger, a whining puppy to a roaring
lion.&quot;&#8212;<i>Congressional Globe</i>, April 20, 1866, Vol. 37, Part 3, p.

When Blaine likened Conkling to a strutting turkey-gobbler, the House

remarked that while they worked hard, they took no thought of the
reform movement. Their sole object was to control the convention. The
confidence which the delegates placed in them was astonishing, but

his paper to Tammany Hall. He intrigued to restore the thieves to
power. He was involved in schemes for robbing the national treasury.
He was plotting the payment of the Confederate debt. He had promised
pensions to Rebel soldiers. He was an original Secessionist. He was
once a slave-trader in Memphis. He was the friend of the Ku-Klux and

the <i>sobriquet</i> &quot;Moses,&quot; he telegraphed in cipher to William T.
Pelton, Tilden's nephew, then domiciled in Tilden's home at 15
Gramercy Park: &quot;Have just received proposition to hand over a Tilden
decision of Board and certificate of Governor for $200,000.&quot; Pelton
thought it too much, and Marble again telegraphed that one Elector
could be secured for $50,000. Pelton replied that he &quot;could not draw
until the vote of the Elector was received.&quot; On December 5, Marble
wired: &quot;Proposition failed.... Tell Tilden to saddle Blackstone.&quot;
</p><p>
Smith M. Weed visited South Carolina. On November 16, without the use
of cipher or <i>sobriquet</i>, he telegraphed Henry Havermeyer: &quot;Board
demand $75,000 for two or three electors.&quot; Later in the day he added:
&quot;Looks now as though $75,000 would secure all seven votes.&quot; The next
day he wired: &quot;Press everywhere. No certainty here. Simply a hope.&quot; On
November 18, he announced: &quot;Majority of Board secured. Cost $80,000.
Send one parcel of $65,000; one of $10,000; one of $5,000. All to be
in $1000 or $500 bills. Have cash ready to reach Baltimore Sunday
night.&quot; Pelton met Weed at Baltimore without the money and both went
to New York to secure it. Meantime, the canvassing board reported in
favour of Hayes.
</p><p>
Pelton also corresponded with one J.N.H. Patrick, who telegraphed from
Oregon: &quot;Must purchase Republican elector to recognise and act with
the Democrat, and secure vote to prevent trouble. Deposit $10,000 to
my credit.&quot; Pelton replied: &quot;If you will make obligation contingent on
result in March it will be done.&quot; Patrick said fee could not be made
contingent, whereupon $8,000 was deposited on January 1, 1877, to his
credit, but too late to complete the transaction.
</p><p>
When these telegrams, translated by the New York <i>Tribune</i>, were
investigated by the Potter Congressional committee in January, 1879,
Marble testified that he transmitted them simply &quot;as danger signals&quot;;
Weed admitted and attempted to justify; Pelton accepted the full
responsibility, intending, he said, to get the money of Edward Cooper;
Cooper testified that the telegram requesting $80,000 sent to
Baltimore was his first knowledge of Pelton's activity; that he
immediately informed Tilden, who recalled his nephew and put a stop to
negotiations. Tilden swore that &quot;no offer, no negotiation in behalf of
any member of any Returning Board was ever entertained by me, or by my
authority, or with my sanction.... There never was a moment in which I
ever entertained any idea of seeking to obtain those certificates by
any venal inducement, any promise of money or office, to the men who
had them to grant or dispose of. My purpose on that subject was
perfectly distinct, invariable, and it was generally assumed by all my
friends without discussion. It may have sometimes been expressed and
whenever the slightest occasion arose for it to be discussed, it was
expressed. It was never deviated from in word or act.&quot;&#8212;Testimony in

appointments and removals was a bill introduced in Congress on
December 20, 1865, by Thomas A. Jenckes of Rhode Island &quot;to regulate
the civil service of the United States.&quot; A few months later Senator B.
Gratz Brown of Missouri submitted a resolution for &quot;such change in the
civil service as shall secure appointments to the same after previous
examinations by proper Boards, and as shall provide for promotions on
the score of merit or seniority.&quot; On March 3, 1871, Congress appended
a section to an appropriation bill, authorising the President to
&quot;prescribe such regulations for the admission of persons into the
civil service as may best promote efficiency therein and ascertain the
fitness of each candidate in respect to age, health, character,
knowledge and ability for the branch of service in which he seeks to
enter; and for this purpose he may employ suitable persons to conduct
such inquiries, prescribe their duties, and establish regulations for
the conduct of persons who may receive appointments.&quot; Under this
authority President Grant organised a commission composed of George
William Curtis, Joseph Medill, Alexander C. Cattell, Davidson A.
Walker, E.B. Ellicott, Joseph H. Blackfan, and David C. Cox. This
commission soon found that Congress was indisposed to clothe them with
the requisite power, and although in the three years from 1872 to
1875, they had established the entire soundness of the reform, an
appropriation to continue the work was refused and the labours of the
commission came to an end.</p></div>

politics, and of the mere party relations of the pending question of
Presidential nominations, the Democrats of New York must frankly tell
him that nothing but injury to the Democracy of New York has come or
can come of coalitions with Senator Conkling. The past is eloquent on
the subject. Whether set on foot by Mr. Tilden in 1873, or by Mr.
Kelly at a later date, Democratic coalitions with Mr. Conkling have
benefited only the Republicans. Mr. Tilden finally came to grief
through them, and so did Mr. Kelly; and, what is more important, so
did the Democratic party.... It is high time that the false lights
which Senator Conkling displayed to certain Democratic senators, and
with the help of whom the nominations of President Hayes were
thwarted, should be understood. The chequered career of Senator
Conkling should compel cautious people to inquire carefully into the
evidence for any declaration which may be made by him as to President
Garfield and his undertaking.&quot;&#8212;New York <i>World</i>, April 1, 1881.</p></div>

resignation to Governor Cornell to-night.' Conkling turned to me and
replied: 'Don't be too hasty about this matter, young man.' We then
went to the rear of the Senate Chamber and talked it over. Conkling
insisted that we should wait, and fight it out in Committee. I
replied, 'We have been so humiliated that there is but one thing for
us to do&#8212;rebuke the President by immediately turning in our
resignations and then appeal to the Legislature to sustain us.' I
induced Conkling to join me in offering our joint resignations, and
that night the papers were forwarded to Cornell by special messenger.&quot;

It was at this time that Platt's opponents gave him the sobriquet of

unjust to the junior Senator, who at least took the lead in suggesting
and insisting upon resigning.</p></div>

During President Hayes' administration not an important appointment
was made in Maine to which Senators Blaine and Hamlin were not
bitterly opposed. One man was appointed after Mr. Blaine had stated
that he was probably the only prominent Republican in the State
personally hostile to him. Yet, with a single exception, all were
confirmed, notwithstanding the opposition of the Maine Senators. But
neither of them resigned. They were too good Republicans for

Chester A. Arthur, No. 123 Lexington Avenue, the following persons
were present: Chester A. Arthur, Thomas C. Platt, Louis F. Payn,
Charles M. Denison, George H. Sharpe, John F. Smyth, A.B. Johnson, and
Roscoe Conkling. Each person was asked to pass judgment upon the
future course of the two Senators. Each one spoke in turn. The sense
of the meeting was that they should proceed to the State
capital.&quot;&#8212;A.R. Conkling, <i>Life of Conkling</i>, pp. 642-643.
</p><p>
&quot;Payn warned both Conkling and Platt that they would be defeated.
Speaker Sharpe admonished Payn that he was wrong. Payn predicted that
while he and other friends were still battling for the organisation
Sharpe would desert them. Payn proved himself a prophet. Sharpe went
over to the opposition.&quot; Platt's Reminiscences.&#8212;<i>Cosmopolitan

York City. The strain and exposure of making his way on foot through
the snowdrifts of the historic blizzard which visited that city in the
spring of 1888, resulted in an abscess in the inner ear, from which he
died on April 18. A bronze statue, erected in his memory, is located
in Madison Square.
